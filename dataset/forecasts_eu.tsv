October/1998	France	None	Following a recovery very much driven by exports in 1997, 1998 has seen a clear rebound of domestic demand, yield- ing  a  GDP  growth  rate  of  3.1%.    The  acceleration  is  re- markable : after 2 years of subdued growth (0.9% per year), internal demand is estimated to accelerate by 3.8% in 1998, benefiting in particular from good employment perform- ance and record low inflation.  All demand components ex- perience this improvement.  Private consumption grows by a very strong 3.6%, while equipment investment also picks up markedly by 8.9%.  The 0.8% growth rate of construc- tion investment may look rather subdued, but it represents a true turn–around compared to previous years.  Logically given both worse external demand and healthy domestic demand, the contribution of net exports to growth in 1998 is estimated to be clearly negative. A negative contribution from the external side is forecast for 1999 as well, but to a lesser extent.  Uncertainties in the world economy are as- sumed to weigh down on the forecast for 1999, not so much through trade but through domestic demand.  Falling busi- ness confidence, already visible in surveys, is expected to fuel more prudent behaviour in terms of equipment invest- ment and stockbuilding.  Private consumption is also ex- pected to return to a more normal pattern.  As a result GDP growth is forecast to slow somewhat in 1999 to 2.6%, be- fore reaccelerating slightly to 2.8% in 2000.  Moderate im- provement is expected in the public sector deficit, which should fall from 2.9% of GDP this year to 2.3% in 1999 and 1.9% in 2000.  The debt to GDP ratio is for ecast to start falling from 2000.		
October/1998	Italy	None	After accelerating in the middle of 1997, real GDP growth weakened  in  the  following  quarters.  The  annual  rate  of growth  slowed  from  2.5%  in  the  first  quarter  of  1998  to 1.1%  in  the  second  quarter  leaving  an  expected  average growth rate for the year as a whole of only 1.7%. Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate gradually in 1999–2000, to approach its trend rate of about 2.5%. Domestic demand continued to be sustained in the first half of 1998, as a result of a large accumulation of stocks and favourable develop- ments  in  equipment  investment.  The  deceleration  of  pri- vate consumption reflects the gradual phasing out of tax in- centives on car sales, the squeeze on personal disposable income and some deterioration in households’ confidence. Private consumption is expected to improve in the period 1999–2000  thanks  to  better  employment  prospects,  im- proving  real  disposable  income  and  lower  interest  rates. Total investment is expected to strengthen (from 3.3% in 1998 to 6.7% in 2000), as result of better demand prospects and a lower cost of capital. Lower world demand will re- duce export growth in 1999, while in 2000 some improve- ments are expected. Import growth is likely to decelerate in 1999 with the fading out of the car incentive scheme, which boosted imports in 1997–98. Employment is expected to improve  gradually  during  the  forecast  period  (+0.3%  in 1999  and  +0.6%  in  2000).    Positive  effects  are  expected from the newly introduced measures for higher flexibility in the labour market and from the initiatives aiming to re- duce labour costs in the depressed areas. Inflation has re- mained subdued (2.2% in 1998) and is expected to remain so, thanks to wage moderation, low commodity prices and the slow pace of economic recovery. The introduction of a wide–ranging fiscal reform has influenced the timing of tax receipts, but the 2.6% deficit target for the year should be met. As the government fell over the adoption of the 1999 budget the no policy change assumption points to a deficit of around 2.3% of GDP. The Draft Budget Law for 1999 in- troduced measures of additional revenues and savings for 0.7%  of  GDP  (according  to  government  estimates),  of which  around  0.3%  are  aimed  at  financing  employment measures and tax relief for the poorest households.  The re- duction in the deficit to 2.0% of GDP in year 2000 is mainly due to lower government interest payments. 		
October/1998	United Kingdom	None	Growth remained stronger than expected in the first half of 1998 so the forecast for the year as a whole has been revised up to 2.5% from 1.9% in the spring. However there are now clear signs that the economy is slowing in response to mon- etary and fiscal tightening. The impact on trade has been particularly  marked  with  the  negative  effects  of  the strength of sterling exacerbated by the crisis in south east Asia. GDP growth is forecast to fall back to 1.3% in 1999 before rising again to around trend at 2.1% in 2000. Infla- tionary pressures in the UK economy are subdued, helped by weak world wide commodity prices, and look set to re- main so. The private consumption deflator is forecast to in- crease by about 2% in all three forecasting years. Buoyant recent revenues and ongoing consolidation resulting from announced plans should ensure that the public finances re- main close to balance over the forecasting horizon, in line with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact.		
October/1998	Spain	None	GDP rose at an annualised rate of 3.8% in the first half of 1998, a rate which is expected to be sustained during the rest  of  the  year.  As  a  result,  for  1998  as  a  whole,  GDP growth is forecast to grow by around 3.8%. Economic ac- tivity in 1999 is expected to decelerate slightly, especially during the first quarters of the year. In 2000, GDP growth is foreseen  to  stabilise  at  around  3.5%.  With  regard  to  the components of growth, in the first half of 1998 domestic demand remained strong, led by private consumption and investment in equipment, whereas the external sector had a negative contribution to GDP growth. Private consumption is expected to increase by 3.4% in 1998, mainly sustained by continued strong job creation. In 1999 it is expected to accelerate,  partially  due  to  the  income  tax  reform  which will  raise  households’  disposable  income.  Investment  in equipment registered a growth rate of 11% in 1997, and for 1998  it  is  expected  to  accelerate further  to  12.5%,  supported by buoyant demand, high profits, low interest rates and a high rate of capacity utilisation. It is forecast to slow down in 1999 (growth rate of about 8%) as a result of the slight internal demand deceleration and the less dynamic external markets. Investment in construction is foreseen to recover  strength  progressively  in  the  forecast  period, owing to lower interest rates and to higher public construc- tion. This year’s acceleration from 1.3% to 6.2% will be continued  in  the  years  1999  and  2000  for  which  growth rates close to 8% are expected 		
October/1998	Netherlands	None	The  Netherlands   are  expected  to  complete  a  five– year–roll   of   economic   growth   close   to   3%   p.a.   in 1996–2000, even displaying an acceleration towards 3  % this year mainly due to strong domestic demand.		
October/1998	Greece	None	In  Greece domestic demand is expected to become the engine of economic growth next year driven by strong  investment  and  a  progressive  rise  in  private  con- sumption. 		
October/1998	Austria	None	While the foreign contribution to growth is ex- pected to remain positive though considerably declining in Austria  		
October/1998	Ireland	None	Ireland adding the years 1998 to 2000 to the suc- cess  story  which  becomes  evident  in  an  average  annual growth  of  7.7%  in  the  1990s,  well  ahead  of  the  second fastest  growing  economy 		
October/1998	Germany	None	Economic activity gathered substantial momentum in the first half of 1998 as GDP grew at an annualised rate of 3.4% (seasonally adjusted). In contrast to 1997, when stocks and net exports were the main determinants, growth was sup- ported by contributions from all domestic components ex- cept construction investment. Against the backdrop of the strong performance in the first half of the year, annual out- put growth in 1998 is expected to accelerate compared to last year’s 2.2% and to remain close to the 2 ¼ % level in 1999 and close to 2 ½  in 2000. In contrast to many previous years of expansion in Germany, the contribution of net ex- ports to GDP growth will be virtually negligible because net exports are affected by the deterioration of the external environment. Therefore the driving force of future output growth will be domestic demand. Private consumption will continue to accelerate moderately, supported by  low price rises and a sustained improvement in labour incomes.  The contribution of government consumption will be small but distinctly positive in 1998 with some acceleration starting next  year  as  a  further  slight  loosening  of  the  budgetary stance  takes  hold.  Although  the  strong  growth  of  equip- ment  investment  will  be  partly  compensated  for  by  a further  fall  in  construction  investment  in  1998,  overall capital formation is expected to grow much more strongly than last year. While equipment investment is expected to slow down from the current year, not least due to uncer- tainty regarding the effects of the international crises, for construction investment a slow recovery is forecast on the basis of some encouraging recent developments in orders and the expected acceleration in public work projects. Total investment is expected to continue to support economic- growth  in  1999  and  2000  as  continued  high  profitability and the transition to the euro act as a stimulus for enter- prises to renew their capital stock. Due to continued econ- omic expansion the labour market should continue to im- prove gradually. However, job creation will be limited at first, accelerating only towards the year 2000. Inflationary pressures  remain  low,  thanks  to  continued  wage  moder- ation and the decline in import prices. Further contributions to price stability stem from the depreciation of the US dollar since mid–1998 and a technical effect whereby the impact of the April 1998 VAT increase on prices falls out of the figures. 		
April/1999	Belgium	None	The  pace  of  economic  activity  decelerated  in  the  second half of 1998 mainly as a result of faltering external demand. In fact, the advanced indicator of economic activity, pub- lished by the Central Bank, has been falling since the fourth quarter of 1997 and more markedly since November 1998. As a result of further deceleration in activity during the first half of the year, real GDP growth is expected to slowdown from 2.9 % in 1998 to 1.9 % in 1999; however a rapid re- covery  is  foreseen  from  the  second  semester  of  the  year. These movements are mainly related to external develop- ments while domestic demand is expected to continue to be supportive in 1999, reflecting favourable consumer confi- dence levels, low interest rates and import prices; neverthe- less, increase in domestic demand should decelerate from 4.4 % in 1998 to 2.4 % in the current year. Private consumption is foreseen to increase by 2.4 % re- flecting  improvement  in  employment,  a  moderate  rise  in real  disposable  income,  and  persisting  consumer  confi- dence. Private investment should decelerate from 5 % in 1998 to 4 % in 1999, as a result of a reduction in capacity utilisation registered in the latest months of 1998 and the ikely postponement of investment decisions. Acceleration in gross capital formation and in exports will be the main driving factors of real GDP recovery in 2000 to 2.5 %. Wage moderation and measures taken in recent years in fa- vour of employment creation, particularly reduced social contributions for lower paid jobs, are expected to alleviate the negative impact of the slowdown in activity on the la- bour market. Total employment growth should decelerate from  1.3  %  in  1998  to  0.7  %  in  1999  and  then  recover somewhat to 0.9 % in 2000. The standardised unemploy- ment rate is forecast to decline from 8.8% in 1998 to 8.3 % in 1999 and to about 7.8% in 2000. Nominal compensation of employees per head is expected to  rise  on  average  by  about  2 ¼  %  per  year  in  the  period 1999–2000 implying real increases of about 1 percentage point  in  both  years.  Consumer  prices  are  expected  to  in- crease by 1 % in 1999, as in 1998, and to slightly accelerate in 2000 as a result of stronger demand. The  general  government  deficit  declined  from  1.9  %  of GDP in 1997 to 1.3 % in 1998 reflecting the effect of strong economic growth, in particular dynamic private consump- tion, and falling interest payments. On the basis of the cur- rent stance of fiscal policy, including a planned reduction in social security contributions in the coming years, the gov- ernment deficit is estimated to fall to just under 1 % of GDP in 1999. In fact, the expected slowdown in economic activ- ity should not have a significant effect on the projected defi- cit. The reduction in the deficit in 1999 will be partly due to the fact that one–off expenditures were undertaken in 1998, while lower than normal non–tax revenue were recorded; moreover, in 1999, roll–over of part of the public debt will be executed at declining interest rates.		
April/1999	Denmark	None	Following real GDP growth of about 2.7% in 1998, econ- omic activity is expected to slow down in 1999 with annual GDP growth of about 1.7%. Growth of domestic demand should  weaken  to  annual  2.0%,  partly  induced  by  the “Whitsun  package”. The  “Whitsun  package”,  which  was adopted in June 1998, aims at stabilising domestic demand, the main instruments being different tax measures such as a reduction  in  the  tax  allowance  for  interest  payments  on mortgage loans. Exports, which in 1998 were depressed by the  large  labour  market  conflict,  should  improve.  In  the year 2000 a slight recovery is expected, with GDP growing by some 2.0%. The weakening of domestic demand in 1999 is mainly due to a slackening of private consumption as the rise in both employment and housing prices, the main driving factors in 1998, is expected to fade out. Moreover, the effects of the Whitsun package should dampen the disposable income of households. Investment is expected to slow considerably in 1999. This is  in  particular  valid  for  equipment  investment  since  de- mand expectations are at a very low level, profit margins are  falling  and  capacity  utilisation  has  decreased  signifi- cantly during the last months. The growth rate of invest- ment in non–residential construction should also decline, mainly  as  a  result  of  a  reduction  in  infrastructure  invest- ment. However, the growth rate of residential construction is anticipated to decrease only slightly as the effect of the reduced tax deduction for mortgage loans included in the Whitsun  package  will  be  largely  offset  by  lower  interest rates. Exports are expected to increase somewhat, which mainly corresponds  to  a  technical  rebound  following  the  labour market conflict in spring last year. However, they will re- main  moderate  due  to  reduced  growth  in  Danish  export markets and a further loss of market shares. Import growth will be dampened by the general slowdown in domestic de- mand and, as a result, the balance of trade of goods and ser- vices should improve. In 2000, the impact of the Whitsun package on both con- sumption  and  residential  construction  should  be  stronger since interest rates are assumed to increase slightly. The ex- ternal contribution to GDP growth should further amelior- ate and the balance in the trade of services should improve.Unemployment  decreased  significantly  during  1998,  re- aching some 5%. The labour market is expected to remain rather tight and unemployment is forecast to decline further in 1999 and edge up in 2000. The tight labour market in 1998 was reflected in wage in- creases of about 4.4%. This situation is expected to con- tinue in 1999 and 2000 with wage increases of some 4%. Consumer prices increased by 1.3% in 1998. In 1999, the HICP  is  expected  to  rise  by  about  1.7%.  The  increase  in comparison to 1998 is due to higher indirect taxes on energy and the absence of the moderating effect of falling import prices observed in 1998. The increase in the HICP is fore- cast to level off in 2000. Government  finances  are  expected  to  remain  sound.  For 1999 a budget surplus of about 2.8% is forecast and the gov- ernment’s  gross  debt  could  fall  below  55%  of  GDP.  For 2000 a budget surplus of about 3.0% is expected and the gross debt could fall to close to 50% of GDP. Unemployment  decreased  significantly  during  1998,  re- aching some 5%.

April/1999	Germany	None	The German economy grew by a fairly strong 2.8% in 1998. Towards the end of the year, however, the negative effects of the international economic slowdown made themselves felt,  particularly  in  the  industrial  sector.  In  the  fourth quarter,  GDP  contracted  by  almost  half  a  point  on  the quarter, despite  robust private consumption. The forecast does not incorporate the  revision in 1998 GDP data pub- lished in March 1999. The revision of the data, however, does not alter the scenario presented in the forecast. GDP growth is likely to remain subdued in the first quarter of 1999. Depressed business confidence is likely to restrain investment; moreover, survey results seem to indicate that enterprises  increasingly  consider  their  stocks  of  finished products to be too high. This might well lead to destocking, and  therefore  lower  production,  in  the  first  half  of  1999. From then on, however, a gradual recovery is expected, be- cause the effects of the international financial crisis should fade out and private consumption should be increasingly buoyant.  The  decline  in  interest  rates,  witnessed  during 1998, should also tend to support economic growth. Over- all, the economy should improve in the course of the year, but, owing to a weak overhang at the end of 1998 and to a subdued first quarter, GDP is expected to expand by only about  1.7%  in  1999.  In  2000,  GDP  growth  could  reach 2.4%. Private  consumption  will  continue  to  accelerate  in  1999, supported by a very low inflation rate and a sustained im- provement  of  labour  incomes.  Furthermore,  consumers’ confidence has continued to improve in the last months, not least owing to the clear fall in unemployment from its peak at the end of 1997. In the year 2000, however, a slightly higher  inflation  is  expected  to  erode  part  of  the  gains  in households’ purchasing power, leading to a slight deceler- ation in real private consumption growth rate. Government consumption is likely to grow less than GDP in both 1999 and in 2000. Investment  is  not  expected  to  show  much  dynamism  in 1999.  Business  confidence  declined  sharply  during  1998 and until now, no improvement has been seen. Manufac- turers in particular are hit by a contraction in orders at the end of 1998, an acceleration in wages and, at least in the short term, a higher fiscal burden due to the closing of tax loopholes. Even though businesses operating in the service sector should benefit from stronger domestic demand, the now higher degree of uncertainty is likely to result in in- creased caution in decisions involving investments or per- sonnel. The improvement in the economic situation will in due course lead to more investment, but this will pay off mostly in 2000. Thus, equipment investment is forecast  to grow distinctly less in 1999 than in 1998. As for construc- tion investment, the outlook remains subdued. Exports declined sharply in the last quarter of 1998. Clear- ly, the deceleration of exports is set to continue in 1999;nevertheless, export markets should begin to recover this year. Furthermore, exports will also be supported by the re- versal  of  the  currency  appreciation  of  the  second  half  of 1998. The improvement should be clearer in 2000 as the ef- fects of the international crisis fade out. Imports, stimulated by  higher  private  consumption,  should  outpace  exports, leading to a negative overall growth contribution in 1999. The external growth contribution is, however, expected to become positive again in 2000. The  labour  market  situation  is  not  expected  to    improve much in 1999. The increase in the budget for active labour market  policies  envisaged  in  the  1999  budget  will,  how- ever, on average avoid a deterioration of the situation com- pared to 1998. Stronger growth should again lead to net job creation by the private sector in the year 2000. Against this background and also thanks to demographic trends, unem- ployment is expected to decrease further, but will stay close to 4 million on an annual average basis. Despite a 1–point increase in the VAT rate in April 1998, inflation  fell  to  only  0.2%  year–on–year  by  early  1999, thanks  to  sharp  declines  in  import  prices  and  unit  labour costs. CPI inflation should remain well below 1% in 1999, even  though  wages  growth  and  unit  labour  costs  are  ex- pected to accelerate compared to 1998. In 2000, only a mar- ginal pick–up in inflation is expected. The general government deficit declined further in 1998, from  2  %  to  close  to  2%  of  GDP.  Given  the  economic slowdown and low inflation, which reduces the growth of nominal GDP, a marginal increase in the deficit is expected in 1999, even though budgetary planning continues to be oriented  towards  containing  expenditure.  The  debt  ratio should remain close to present levels throughout the fore- cast period.		
April/1999	Greece	None	The performance of the Greek economy continued to im- prove: GDP growth accelerated while significant progress was achieved in curbing inflation and correcting fiscal im- balances. In March 1998, the drachma entered the ERM at a central  rate  representing  a  12.1%  devaluation  of  the currency. Domestic demand, in particular private consump- tion, slowed somewhat in 1998, under the combined impact of the devaluation and the moderate wage settlement. In- vestment activity continued to be strong while exports con- tributed to the acceleration in real output to an estimated rate of growth of 3.7%. Real output growth might deceler- ate temporarily in 1999 due to less dynamic export activity but  domestic  demand  is  expected  to  accelerate  this  year. Private consumption is forecast to recover in line with in- creasing real disposable income as the tax system is reach- ing its maturity. Investment is expected to remain the driv- ing force of domestic demand. The situation in the labour market improved in 1998, albeit marginally,  and  the  unemployment  rate  resumed  a  slow downward path. The improvement in the labour market is expected to be supported in the remainder of the forecasting period by sustained activity and the announced plans for structural reform. Real wages decelerated significantly in 1998, reflecting the restrictive incomes policy in the public sector and the two–year wage agreement signed in May inthe  private  sector,  which  provides  for  nominal  wage  in- creases on the basis of expected inflation. With real wages growing  below  labour  productivity,  unit  labour  costs  are forecast to rise at a moderate pace in both years. Slowing demand and labour costs assisted the containment of inflation in the post–devaluation period. On average con- sumer  prices  rose  by  4.8%  in  1998,  down  from  5.5%  in 1997. In this context, the appreciation of the drachma and low  international  commodity  prices  played  a  significant role, while underlying inflation was also on a downward path during the second half of 1998. Slowing labour costs, lower indirect taxes and international commodity prices are expected  to  contribute  to  further  disinflation  during  the forecasting  period.  Year–on–year  CPI  inflation  reached 3.7% in January and February 1999, and is expected to de- celerate further as from April when the impact of the last year devaluation will be fully absorbed.Public finance posted an uninterrupted improvement since 1994. The March 1998 devaluation was accompanied by fiscal measures aimed at preventing any overshoot in the budgetary targets. Due to the successful implementation of the accompanying measures, the general government defi- cit was 2.4% of GDP in 1998 as targeted in the convergence programme. Government debt was reduced by 2.9 percen- tage points of GDP, mainly due to higher receipts from pri- vatisation, following the implementation of the structural part of the accompanying measures. For 1999, the deficit of the general government is forecast to be 2.1% of GDP. Risks emanating from current revenues and primary expenditure are relatively small. This is par- ticularly  true  on  the  revenue  side  which  benefits  from growth dividend and the maturity of the fiscal system. The primary surplus is expected to reach 6.5% of GDP in 1999 and 2000 thus contributing to a further decline in the debt ratio in both years.		
April/1999	Spain	None	GDP  accelerated  in  1998,  increasing  by  3.8%  compared with 3.5% in 1997. This acceleration took place mainly dur- ing the first half of the year, while in the second half activity decelerated slightly due to the international environment. Output growth was driven by domestic demand, especially private consumption and investment in equipment, while the external sector made a  widening negative contribution. The main impact of the unfavourable international setting is being felt through the external sector leading to a further deceleration of Spanish exports during 1999. As a result, GDP growth is expected to moderate to 3.3% in 1999. This scenario would lead to an accentuation of the trends previ- ously observed: a healthy domestic demand and a growing negative contribution from the external sector. As domestic conditions are expected to remain growth–supportive, the foreseen gradual improvement of external demand from the end of 1999 would  push output growth in 2000 towards an average rate of 3.5%.During 1999 domestic demand should  remain strong, des- pite the worsening in the international situation, based on the strengthening of private consumption and investment in construction.  In  1999  private  consumption  is  to  keep  its previous strong pace mainly due to the personal income tax reform  implemented  since  January  this  year,  which  will imply an increase in households’ disposable income. Addi- tionally, although more moderately than in 1998, job cre- ation  would  still  be  significant.  Regarding  investment  in construction, its dynamism would stem from higher public construction  and the historically low interest rates which will boost residential construction. In contrast, investment in equipment is likely to slow down during 1999 due to the less dynamic external demand. As for 2000, private consumption is expected to decelerate slightly in line with the moderation of households’ incomes due to the fading away of the first impacts of the tax reform. As investment in construction is also likely to grow more moderately, domestic demand should be increasingly sup- ported by the recovery in investment in equipment, thanks to the improvement in international economic  prospects. Employment rose briskly by 3.3% in 1998 and in 1999 is expected  to  decelerate  in  line  with  economic  activity  to 2.6%. These favourable developments can be partially ex- plained by the labour market reforms implemented in re- cent years which have improved labour flexibility and have contributed to wage moderation. As a result, the still very high  unemployment  rate  would  continue  decreasing  to reach 17.3% in 1999 compared to 18.8% in 1998. Strong economic activity in Spain is compatible with sub- dued inflation rates. HICP inflation was 1.8% in 1998. As energy and commodity prices are expected to remain low in 1999 and wage moderation is to continue, no inflationary pressures are foreseen in the near future. In addition, the large  slack  in  labour  resources  and  the  deregulation measures  which  are  expected  to  be  implemented  should also help to ease inflationary pressures. The current account balance is expected to deteriorate grad- ually. Thus, in 1998, the surplus registered in 1997 shiftedinto a deficit and in 1999 and 2000 this deficit is expected to increase  due to the growing trade deficit, which could not be offset by the surplus in the service balance. The  general  government  deficit  fell  significantly  from 2.6% of GDP in 1997 to a lower–than–expected 1.8% in 1998 which is below the target of 2.1% (when the budget was presented the target was 2.5%), mainly a result of lower government primary expenditure owing to the restraint of government consumption. In 1999, the general government deficit is expected to de- cline  to  1.6%  of  GDP.  The  positive  carry  over  effects  in 1999  of  the  better–than–expected  budgetary  outcome  in 1998 would be nearly cancelled out by the impact on the public finances from slower growth in 1999. There are also some uncertainties related to the final results for direct tax revenues due to the personal income tax reform. As a result, the deficit reduction in 1999 would rest mainly on the ex- pected  continuation  in  primary  expenditure  containment. In the context of the usual unchanged economic policy as- sumption, the deficit would fall to 1.3% of GDP in 2000 in the framework of a progressive recovery of economic ac- tivity. In 1998, the debt–to–GDP ratio fell to 65.6%, and is ex- pected to decline further to 64.7% in 1999 and to 62.4% in 2000. This reduction of the debt ratio would stem only from the gradual improvement foreseen in the primary surplus. Although the implicit interest rate of the debt would tend to decrease,  the  expected  deceleration  of  economic  activity along with a moderate inflation would also reduce nominal GDP growth, leading to a slight debt increasing ”snow–ball effect”.		
April/1999	France	None	The deterioration in the world economy slowed the pace of recovery. The visible signs of this were the contraction of foreign trade and the slowdown in stockbuilding against a background of a deteriorating production outlook in manu- facturing. There was a marked decline in exports under the twin impact of the slowdown in worldwide demand and a decline in competitiveness. Nevertheless, the recovery that was first discernible in 1997 continued  in  1998  as  domestic  demand  became  much stronger,  thereby  permitting  aggregate  GDP  growth  of 3.2% and a healthy employment situation which allowed the jobless rate to be trimmed back by more than one per- centage point between mid–1997 and the end of 1998.The other feature of the current recovery is low inflation. This  fell  again,  to  0.3%  on  a  year–on–year  basis  by  De- cember 1998. Economic activity is likely to have slackened temporarily at the turn of the year. This slowdown came sufficiently late for its effect on annual growth in 1998 to be negligible, al- though it is likely to have a marked impact on growth in 1999. The contribution of foreign trade to GDP growth will still be negative in 1999. Private consumption looks set for sustained progress, although slowing down compared with 1998’s exceptional rate of growth. High levels of purchas- ing power and consumer confidence should be maintained in 1999. The rise in average wages per head is expected to slacken only slightly. At the same time, the pace of job cre- ation is likely to remain sustained, notably in the construc- tion and service industries and especially in the non–market sector. In sum, the gains in the purchasing power of total wages  and  salaries  observed  in  1998  should  continue  in 1999 and 2000. Housing investment, which was already staging a revival at the end of 1998, should continue its upward trend in 1999 (+5.0%): demand for new houses is still very high and ac- tivity has intensified, equalling its 1990 peak. Business behaviour is less certain. Despite the continuing recovery in the financial position of enterprises, business investment in plant and machinery is likely to be halved in 1999  (+4.2%)  owing  to  the  erosion  of  demand  expecta- tions. The current time lag before the impact on investment is felt appears to be shorter than during the slowdown in 1995 and 1996. An upward adjustment in demand expecta- tions, which seems to be taking place at the beginning of 1999, could pave the way for a resurgence in manufacturing investment  starting  in  the  spring.  Business  investment  in building  and  construction,  which  started  to  improve  in 1998, should speed up over the coming quarters. Against  this  background,  CPI  inflation  should  remain  in check, holding steady at an annual average of around 0.5% in 1999, before rising slightly in 2000. Compared with im- ported  disinflation,  there  is  no  discernible  wage  pressure despite the downward trend in unemployment. In  1998  the  general  government  deficit  was  reduced  to 2.9% of GDP, slightly below the initial target of 3%. Rev- enues were higher than originally forecast and very tight rein  was  kept  on  central  government  expenditure.  How- ever, substantial overspending was recorded for expendi- ture on sickness insurance. In 1999 the deficit is currently estimated to fall to 2.4% of GDP, primarily as a result of continued restraint in public spending. There are mainly two major risks to this trend. First, low inflation could exert a brake on revenues in nom- inal terms. Second, the forecast is based on the assumption that the overspending on health will not be repeated. The Government has made changes to certain taxes (the most important one the removal over a five–year period of wages from the basis of assessment for business tax) the overall impact of which should slightly reduce the aggregate tax burden. The slowdown in activity should have a relatively small impact on government accounts owing to the nature of the French tax system (the receipts from certain key taxessuch as personal income tax and corporation tax are col- lected one year after the underlying economic activity has taken place) and, in particular, to the structure of growth. In 2000 the government deficit is forecast to fall to 2.0% of GDP under the no policy change assumption. While still below 60%, the debt ratio is likely to continue to rise in 1998 and 1999. The debt ratio is expected to start fal- ling from 2000 onwards.		
April/1999	Ireland	None	The  economy  looks  to  have  surpassed  expectations  once again in 1998, with real GDP estimated to have increased by almost 12%. The pace of expansion is projected to slow only moderately over the period to 2000, as the components of domestic demand in particular continue to grow strongly. The growth of private consumption is expected to moderate only slightly to about 7 ½ % in 1999 as household disposable incomes continue to be buoyed by rising compensation per head, tax cuts, further growth in employment and reduced mortgage  interest  payments.  Consumption  growth  is  ex- pected to be 7% in 2000. Investment growth is expected to slow a little over the forecast period. At the same time the growth in public consumption should be restrained by the Government’s  intention  to  reduce  the  growth  of  current government expenditure.The  substantial  fall  in  interest  rates  in  the  last  quarter  of 1998 combined with tax cuts amounting to 1% of GDP and additional  expenditure  commitments  in  the  1999  budget should  sustain  the  growth  in  domestic  demand  over  the forecast period. The 1999 budget also allows for a further IEP 350 million (about  ½ % of GDP) of tax cuts in  2000 which should also sustain demand. Exporters are expected to continue to make gains in market share in line with the experience throughout the 1990s.  The continued strength of domestic demand in 1999 is, mean- while,  expected to sustain the growth of imports, thereby further reducing the external contribution to growth. While the merchandise trade balance nevertheless continues to re- main in substantial surplus, both the services and the net factor incomes balances are expected to decline, resulting in a gradual  reduction of the current account surplus over the forecast period. CPI inflation peaked at 3.2% year–on–year in August 1998 and has been on a steady downward trend since then. For 1998 as a whole the figure was 2.4%. Wage developments,meanwhile,  have been in the opposite direction: +5.8% in the year to September 1998 for industrial workers, +12.5% in construction and +4.9% in the public sector in the year to June 1998. With the extreme openness of the economy and generally low international inflation there is little prospect of externally driven inflation over the forecast period. This should  restrain  consumer  price  increases.  However,  the signs of overheating in the labour market are expected to worsen and wage increases are therefore expected to rise throughout the period of the forecast, with compensation per head expected to be rising by over 7% in 2000. Employment  growth  should    remain  strong  in  both  1999 and 2000 but the decline in unemployment is expected to remain lower than the rise in employment as participation continues  its  long–term  rise  and  inward  migration  con- tinues. The  combination  of  continued  strong  revenue  growth  in line with the overall economy and more limited growth in expenditure should see the budget surplus increase in both 1999 and 2000. The surplus should reach about 3% of GDP in 2000 with the debt ratio falling to about 35% of GDP.		
April/1999	Italy	None	Unlike other European countries, economic growth in Italy is expected to improve slightly in 1999, after the  lower– than–expected outcome of 1998. Real GDP growth is ex- pected  to  strengthen  moderately,  from  1.4%  in  1998  to 1.6% this year, and to increase  to above 2% in 2000. Hence, the significant difference in growth between  Italy and other countries of the euro zone is assumed to narrow gradually during the forecasting period In 1999 lower interest rates should help sustain domestic demand, which  should continue to grow, net of stocks, at a rate close to 2%. However, a marked destocking after the huge inventory build–up recorded in 1998 will prevent total domestic demand from growing faster. On the other hand, the contribution of external trade, though remaining nega- tive, is expected to cease to impose a severe constraint on GDP growth. In 2000 economic growth is foreseen to be sup- ported both by domestic demand and improving exports. Private consumption in 1999 is expected to maintain broad- ly the same pace as in 1998 (just below 2%). In the  context of a further fall in inflation, higher real disposable income is expected to support households’ consumption. A more pro- nounced acceleration is expected to take place in 2000. The declining trend in the households’ saving ratio is expected to continue, although at a markedly slower pace than ob- served between 1996 and 1998 Total investment is expected to decelerate slightly in 1999, on account of a marked slowdown of investment in equip- ment .  Indeed, the recent decline in the level of capacity uti- lisation in the manufacturing sector and the fall in business confidence are likely to restrain investment initiatives in the short term. Later in the year, however, fixed capital forma- tion should recover, thanks to improving demand prospects and  the  announced  changes  in  the  tax  treatment  of  rein- vested profits. On the other hand, investment in construc- tion, which remained considerably depressed in the last few years, should restart, helped by the incentives for housing restructuring and by the ongoing recovery of public invest- ment. The recovery of total investment is expected to con- solidate in 2000. Export growth is foreseen to decelerate further in 1999, in line with the expected evolution of world demand. In 2000, the expected improvement in the international environment should  allow  a  less  subdued  export  performance.  Import growth is expected to decelerate in 1999, as the exceptional circumstances which have boosted imports in 1997–98 (car incentives,  restocking,  international  price  developments) will fade out. A visible acceleration is expected in 2000, driven by stronger domestic demand. The trade balance is likely to remain above 3% of GDP during the period under consideration. Employment is projected to improve gradually during the forecast period. Notwithstanding the slow pace of the econ- omic recovery, employment is expected to benefit – as al- ready happened in 1998 – from higher flexibility in the la- bour  market  and  from  the  various  initiatives  aimed  at reducing labour costs in the depressed areas. Inflation is expected to remain subdued in 1999 in line with the expected evolution in other euro–zone countries. Low import prices, moderate output growth (leaving a  negative output gap) and continuing wage moderation should allow a decline of CPI inflation to below 1.5% this year. Notwith- standing a slight acceleration in 2000, inflation is unlikely to exceed 2% throughout the forecasting period. As  for  public  finances,  the  general  government  deficit  is estimated at 2.3% of GDP this year. The primary surplus is likely to deteriorate slightly and to be  well below the gov- ernment’s target of 5.5%. Most of the slippage in the pri- mary  surplus  is  accounted  for  by  lower–than–expected growth  (the  government  assumption  for  growth  in  1999 was  2.5%).  On  the  other  hand,  interest  payments,  which were set at 7.5% of GDP in the government projections, are likely  to  decline  more  rapidly,  thereby  limiting  the  over- shooting of the deficit target. Total revenues are projected to decrease slightly as a percentage of GDP, in line with the objective of reducing the fiscal burden, while total expendi- ture net of interest payments is expected to remain broadly unchanged as a percentage of GDP. However, some re–bal- ancing in favour of capital expenditure is expected .  As far as 2000 is concerned, a no policy–change scenario is as- sumed,  which  does  not  take  into  account  the  corrective measures announced but not specified in the Stability pro- gramme.  Nonetheless,  the  deficit  is  assumed  to  decrease further to 2.1% of GDP,  mainly as a a result of lower in- terest payments. The debt ratio is expected to continue to decline slightly over the forecast period, to reach 112.6% of GDP in the year 2000		
April/1999	Luxembourg	None	According to initial estimates, real GDP grew by 5.7% in 1998 as compared with 3.7% in 1997. This strong growth was  driven  by  particularly  buoyant  private  consumption (up 3.8%, as against 2.8% the previous year), by investment and by exports, which dipped only very slightly in compari- son with the previous year. The main engine of growth was market  services,  where  value  added  is  thought  to  have grown by nearly 5.3% (6.7% in financial services), but in- dustry did not mark time either, with 3.7% growth, although metal processing suffered a very marked slowdown in the course  of  the  year.    The  construction  industry  also  per- formed well (up 5.4%). This very strong growth brought about a sharp rise in employment (4.4%). Most of the jobs created (two thirds in 1998, as against an average of nearly 75% in previous years) were taken up by frontier workers, the  number  of  whom  rose  by  over  10%.    However,  the growth in jobs held by residents, at nearly 2%, was much higher than in previous years.  The result has been a fall in unemployment, for the first time since the end of the 1980s. Along with neighbouring countries, inflation was particularly low, with the consumer price index creeping up by a mere 1% for the year as a whole, as compared with 1.4% in 1997. As in most other Member States, growth is expected to de- celerate quite appreciably in Luxembourg in 1999 under the impact of the deteriorating international climate, falling to around 3 ¼ %.  The forecast is for the growth in exports to slow sharply, particularly exports of goods, which should grow by just under 4%. Investment is also expected to increase much more slowly than last year, a trend which would, however, hold back the growth  of  imports.    Growth  should  pick  up  again  in  the year  2000  as  exports  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  investment stage  a  recovery.    Employment  will  follow  this  overall trend: it should grow more slowly this year, albeit still at around  2%,  far  outstripping  the  European  average.  Em- ployment growth should pick up again in 2000 to around 3%.  Unemployment could level off in absolute terms and even decline slightly In 1998 the public finance situation remained particularly sound, with general government recording as in previous years a substantial surplus (some 2.1% of GDP).  Public debt rose slightly but remained at a very low level (6.7% ofGDP, as against 6.4% in 1997). The persistence of fairly brisk  growth  in  1999  and  2000  should  enable  the  public authorities to continue to maintain a particularly favourable financial situation		
April/1999	Netherlands	None	Dutch gross domestic product grew by 3.7% in real terms in 1998, the highest rate of the decade.  Even more than in the preceding years, growth was driven by domestic demand and in particular by private consumption, which proved to be  extremely  buoyant,  growing  by  almost  4.4%  in  real terms,  the  highest  figure  since  1976.  The  main  determi- nants of such buoyancy were, as in the preceding years, the rapid increase in employment, the large reduction in taxes and  social  contributions  achieved  during  the  last  parlia- ment, and probably the improvement in the asset situation of households, linked to the sharp rise in the stock exchange and house prices.  In addition, wage increases accelerated appreciably, and since mid–1997 are again running at more than an annualised 3%. However, investment grew by only 4% compared with 6.8% in 1997. Imports, reflecting the buoyancy  of  domestic  demand,  increased  significantly while exports suffered from the deterioration in the interna- tional environment, and slowed markedly over the year. Growth will probably not exceed 2 ¼ % in 1999 since ex- ports are not likely to grow by more than 4%.  Similarly, in- vestment should increase by a bare 1 ¼ %, reflecting the de- terioration in enterprises confidence.  Private consumption will continue to underpin growth, as a result of the same factors which have contributed to its buoyancy over recent years. Real GDP growth is likely to pick up speed again in 2000 as a result in particular to a recovery of exports; real GDP growth could thus reach 2 ¾ %. In 1998, despite the buoyancy of the economy, which was reflected in substantially higher tax revenues, the general government deficit remained stable at 0.9% of GDP, as in 1997; public debt continued to decline, from 71.2% of GDP to 67.7%. The economic slowdown is likely to be reflected in 1999 by a deterioration in the public deficit, which is esti- mated to rise to 1.6% of GDP, before coming down again to around  1.3%  next  year,  in  response  to  the  pick–up  in growth.  The fall in the debt ratio is likely to continue at a slower pace and it should come down to 67% of GDP this year and 65.5% in 2000. 		
April/1999	Austria	None	Following output growth of more than 3% in 1998, econ- omic activity in Austria is expected to increase less strongly in 1999 under the influence of slowing growth in the econ- omies of main trading partners, in particular Germany. The observed deterioration of business confidence and of other short–term  indicators  such  as  industrial  production  and merchandise exports are clear evidence of a slowdown in the Austrian economy during the winter half–year 1998/99. In accordance with the assumed gradual improvement in the international environment, output growth should, how- ever, regain momentum in the second half of 1999. Annual growth for 2000 is thus estimated at some 2 ¾  % Domestic demand is expected to remain robust throughout the forecast period. Supply side conditions – in particular unit labour costs and the user cost of capital – will, in gen- eral, remain favourable, bolstering private investment. Pri- vate consumption should continue to be strong – despite a further increase in the households saving ratio from its his- torically  low  level  in  1997  –  underpinned  by  higher  em- ployment and accelerating wage increases. The contribu- tion of net exports to GDP growth, which was one of the main  driving  forces  during  the  upswing  in  1997/98  will, under  the  assumed  international  economic  scenario,  turn negative in 1999 and reverse in 2000. The trade balance will continue to improve in 1999 with the deterioration  in  volume  terms  being  more  than  offset  by gains  in  the  terms  of  trade.  This,  in  conjunction  with  a marked recovery of tourism net income should contribute to a further improvement in the current account from the rather high deficit of around 2% of GDP witnessed in the recent past. As elsewhere in Europe, thanks also to low import prices, there  are  no  inflationary  pressures  in  Austria  at  present. However, in view of an acceleration in pay rises and the closing of the output gap consumer prices are expected to edge up from 1999 onwards. Mainly due to relatively high productivity increases, unit labour costs will rise only mod- erately. The significant improvement in relative unit labour costs  between  1996  and  1998  will  thus  be  largely  safe- guarded during the forecast period. In line with the relatively favourable outlook for growth, employment  is  expected  to  increase,  although  somewhat less than in 1998. The forecast assumes that the recent in- crease in the labour force participation rate, which has been partially  due  to  policy  measures  –  such  as  a   de  facto shortening of parental leave – will level off during the pro- jection period. As a consequence, and in contrast to previ- ous  years,  during  the  forecast  period  employment  gains should be more directly translated into a decline in the un- employment rate. Consolidation of government finances  paused in 1998, but is expected to resume in 1999/2000 with a gentle decrease in the government deficit for both years. This forecast in- corporates the assumption that recent changes in family as- sistance will burden government finances by 0.2% of GDP in 1999 and by 0.4% of GDP in 2000. The reform of family assistance will be part and parcel of a more general tax re- form that will take effect in 2000. The additional measures, which at the time when the forecast was prepared were not known in detail and have thus not been incorporated, are supposed to provide a net tax relief of the order  ½  of a per- cent of GDP. Unless compensated by expenditure savings this would imply a significant increase in the budget deficit in 2000.		
April/1999	Portugal	None	Following  the  acceleration  of  economic  activity  in  1997 and 1998, a slowdown in GDP growth seems likely in 1999. The main factors behind this development are the abating of the effects of Expo98 and a decline in business confidence associated with the less favourable international environ- ment. These dampening effects will, however, be partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. As a result, a weaker contribution of domestic demand and less buoyant export  growth  could  restrain  GDP  growth  to  somewhat above 3%. A slight rebound is expected in 2000 when a re- covery of external demand will lead to a less negative con- tribution from the external balance to GDP growth. Due to the pick–up of the economy and according to the re- vised  employment  survey,  improvements  in  the  labour market were significant in 1998. Employment increased by 2.5% and the unemployment rate decreased to an annual average  of  5.0%.  Employment  gains  were  particularly strong in sectors with low productivity increases such as public and private services. A slight decrease in the unemploy- ment rate is forecast both in 1999 and 2000 and, as a conse- quence, the labour market may become increasingly tight. Private consumption is forecast to grow at a steady albeit de- celerating rate in 1999 and 2000 supported by a sustained in- crease  in  real  disposable  income,  a  continued  good  labour market  situation  and  lower  interest  rates.  Investment  should decelerate somewhat in 1999 but should remain high through- out the forecast period. Construction investment is even ex pected to accelerate slightly but equipment investment could decelerate due to a slowdown of machinery investment after the marked increase during the previous four years. Thanks to high productivity gains in the tradables sector the increase in unit labour costs in this sector will remain moderate allowing exports to rise faster than market growth. The current account deficit is foreseen to increase slightly to 2 ½ % of GDP in 1999 and above 3% of GDP in 2000 Headline inflation accelerated in 1998, due particularly to some special factors like the increase in some food prices and strong demand of some goods and services owing to the Expo98. In the forecast period the decrease of import prices and  the  slowdown  of  economic  activity  are  likely  to dampen  inflationary  pressures  but  this  could  be  counter- acted by wage pressures. The abating of the special factors prevailing in  1998 should nevertheless lead to a deceler- ation of inflation in both 1999 and 2000. In 1998, the general government deficit decreased slightly to 2.3% of GDP. Owing also to asset–related measures, no- tably privatisation, the debt ratio came down  by almost 4 percentage points to some 58% of GDP. The general gov- ernment deficit in 1999 is expected to decline to 2.0% of GDP, mainly as a result of  decreasing interest payments and high output growth, and a further decrease is foreseen in 2000. Similarly, the government debt ratio is expected to continue its downward trend in both 1999 and 2000.		
April/1999	Finland	None	In 1998, GDP rose by an estimated 5.3% (ESA79). Boom- ing  private  consumption  gave  a  strong  boost  to  GDP growth.  Domestic  demand  accounted  for  most  of  overall growth.  The  development  of  Finnish  economy  became greatly polarised since the second half of 1998 as industrial output and net exports decelerated sharply whereas domes- tic demand remained strong. The structure of exports also changed markedly, with ex- ports  of  electronics  and  especially  telecommunications equipment growing rapidly compared to deceleration in al- most all other sectors. The weakened outlook in export markets is expected to lead to a deceleration in economic growth in 1999. The positive development of high–technology exports are expected to partially offset the negative impact of the external sector. The polarisation of economic development, now led by do- mestic demand,  is expected to continue in 1999. House- holds’ confidence has remained at a high level. Private con- sumption  is  estimated  to  have  risen  by  5%  in  1998. Consumers have financed the increases in consumption by borrowing and reduced savings. However, for 1999 private consumption  is  expected  to  decelerate,  because  of  lower wage growth and because the sharp fall in the saving ratio which occurred in 1998 is unlikely to be repeated. Growth of public consumption, on the other hand, has remained subdued. Good  business  profitability  and  the  financial  position  of firms set positive preconditions for investment. Construc- tion activity is expected to remain robust in the forecasting period albeit less buoyant than in 1998. Declining  import  prices  contributed  to  a  deceleration  of consumer price inflation in the course of 1998, leading to an average of 1.4 %. The average inflation rate is expected to fall further in the forecasting period. The rate of employment creation decelerated somewhat in 1998. Most new jobs are being created in the private ser- vices  sector.  The  unemployment  rate,  which  averaged 12.7% in 1997,  declined to 11.4 % in 1998. Employment growth is expected to decelerate despite the shifting  focus  in  GDP  growth  from  the  capital–intensive export industry to the more labour–intensive construction and services sectors. The general government surplus is expected to be close to 2.5% of GDP in the forecasting period. Government con- sumption is assumed to remain subdued, due to the savings measures		
April/1999	Sweden	None	GDP  growth  is  estimated  to  have  been  somewhat  above trend, at 2.9%, in 1998. It was sustained totally by domestic demand.  Despite  strong  growth,  the  economy  was  gen- erally  thought  to  have  been  operating  below  potential throughout  1998  and  inflationary  pressures  were  weak. Moreover,  the  international  economic  environment  and, consequently, the prospects for world growth worsened. It was  this  overall  environment  that  resulted  in  successive cuts in the repo rate to 3.15% in February 1999 from 4.35% at the start of 1998. The indications are that GDP growth in 1999 will be lower than in 1998 at 2.2%. Growth in 2000 should be above trend and is projected to accelerate to 2.7%. Private consumption in 1999 is expected to grow well, at 2.7%. It will be supported by several factors. Real wages should rise moderately. Employment is forecast to grow though  at  reduced  rates  from  1998.  A  temporary  tax  cut will augment disposable income. Consumer confidence with respect to consumers’ own finances is currently high. That still implies a significant rise in the saving ratio though to perhaps a more normal level. In 2000 private consumption growth, at 2.9%, is projected to be a little higher than in 1999. Fixed investment in 1999 should grow well and this will re- sult  from  strong  construction  investment  supported  by strong rises in new dwellings built and by retail and whole- sale  construction.  Equipment  investment  will  grow  more slowly.  Investment  growth  is  expected  to  accelerate  in 2000. Construction investment growth will be  strong as in 1999  and, in addition, equipment investment should grow more rapidly as the prospects for industry improve. Strong growth of consumption and investment in 1999 will be  partly  offset  by  a  negative  contribution  from  stock– building. Export growth will slow in 1999 to a little below the growth in  Sweden’s  markets  but  import  growth  should  also  re- mained  subdued  as  a  result  of  lower  stockbuilding  and slower growth of equipment investment Export growth will recover in 2000 as export markets grow more rapidly but, offsetting this, imports are expected to grow strongly due to stronger growth in domestic demand. Despite  a  temporary  tax  cut  in  1999,  the  effects  of  re- strained expenditure and falling interest costs on the debt should result in a surplus of 0.25% of GDP in the govern- ment finances .  The surplus is expected to rise to 1.8% of GDP in 2000 as economic growth accelerates, interest pay- ments fall further and the temporary tax cut in 1999 is rev- ersed. Debt relative to GDP is expected to fall to 65% at the end of 2000. Output  is  expected  to  remain  below  or  close  to  potential over the next two years. Inflationary pressures will there- fore remain weak. CPI inflation is expected to rise, in part because the recent falls in interest rates fall out of the cal- culation, but inflation should remain below 1% and that is also true on an HICP basis.		
April/1999	United Kingdom	None	GDP grew by 2.3% in 1998 and growth slowed down  in the second half of the year.With prospects of slower growth and little sign of current and future threats to inflation, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee reduced the repo rate from 7 ½ % last October to 5 ½ % in February. The signs are that economic growth  appeared weak, if not flat, around the turn of the year but there are encouraging signs. Manufacturing output rose a little in January. Indus- trial surveys do not reveal buoyancy but they do suggest an improvement in prospects. Consumer confidence is rising. Unemployment    remains  low.  However,  export  volumes are flat. GDP is not expected to fall but it will remain weak in the first half of 1999. This is due to the lagged effect of ster- ling’s strength as well as continued low growth in the UK’s export  markets.  Growth  is  expected  to  recover  to  a  little under trend – estimated to be around 2 ¼  to 2 ½ % a year – in the  second  half  of  the  year  as  the  positive  effects  of  im- proved monetary conditions are felt and the depressing ef- fects  of  sterling’s  strength  on  net  exports  fades .   GDP growth  is  projected  to  average  1.1%  in  1999. Growth should pick up in the first half of 2000 as the full effects of the improved monetary policy conditions are felt and the negative effects of sterling’s appreciation finally fade away. GDP growth in 2000 is projected at 2.3%. Consumers’ expenditure is projected to grow moderately, by 2.2%, in 1999. This is due to modest real rises in wages, continuing  employment  growth  albeit  small,  and  rises  in (net) interest income as cuts in short term interest rates re- duce the cost of servicing mortgage debt. Nevertheless the saving ratio is forecast to rise in 1999 to a more normal level from  1998’s  exceptionally  low  figure.  Consumers’  ex- penditure should also continue to grow moderately in 2000 for similar reasons. Fixed investment is expected to grow in 1999 but at a re- duced rate from 1998. Construction investment should be supported  by  dwellings  investment  and  by  the  govern- ment’s  plans  to  increase  its  share  of  investment  in  GDP. However,  equipment  investment  growth  will  weaken  as subdued profits restrain expenditure. Growth of fixed in- vestment should pick up in 2000 as equipment investment recovers a little. Government investment will continue to grow  strongly.  Growth  in  consumption  and  fixed  invest- ment will be partly offset by a decline in stockbuilding in 1999 following a rapid build–up in 1998. In 2000 this will not be a drag on growth. Growth of exports of goods and services  is expected to re- vive during the course of 1999 as the effects of sterling’s past strength disappears, but net exports in 1999 as a whole are forecast to decline as growth in UK markets falls and import  growth  remains  strong.  In  2000,  the  UK’s  export markets, and hence exports, will grow more strongly as the world outlook improves. Despite weak growth in 1999, employment is expected to grow slightly though the unemployment rate is expected to edge up gradually. The public finances are  projected to  be close  to  balance  in  1999  following  1998’s  surplus.  The move from surplus, in part, results from the effects of faster growth in planned expenditure and falls in revenue from company taxes. The effects of the 1999 budget are expected to be broadly neutral in 1999 and 2000. The public finances are expected to remain close to balance in 2000 when  the debt to GDP ratio is forecast to fall to 46%. During  1999  and  2000,  inflationary  pressures  should  re- main subdued as output moves, initially, below productive potential. Unit labour cost growth is expected to fall a little despite  the  introduction  of  a  minimum  wage,  as  labour market  pressures  fall.  The  government’s  2 ½ %  target  for RPIX inflation is projected to be met in 1999 and 2000 and HICP inflation should  be around 1 ½ %		
April/2000	Germany	Growth to take ground	1999  outcome. Under  the  impact  of  the  international financial  crisis,  GDP  growth  in  1999  slowed  down  to 1.5%, with exports falling sharply in the first half of the year, leading to a strongly negative external contribution to GDP growth for the year as a whole. However, on the back  of  a  vigorous  acceleration  in  external  demand, economic  activity  started  to  change  gear  in  the  second half of the year. Growth outlook. Orders and business climate indicators show that the current year should be characterized by an ongoing   vigour   on   the   external   side,   with   German exporters not only profiting from the depreciation of the euro  but  also  from  strong  demand  by  neighbouring countries  within  the  euro  zone.  Regarding  domestic demand, consumption will be boosted by the implementation of the second step of income tax reform and  further  improvements  on  the  labour  market,  while investment growth should be underpinned by the revival of  external  demand,  rising  capacity  utilization  and  the planned    reform    of corporate taxation in 2001. Government  consumption  is  likely  to  remain  subdued, not  least  as  a  consequence   of   the   savings   package adopted by the federal governement. While construction investment should be driven by investment at the plant and  the  owner-occupied  residential  level,  the  ongoing problems   in   rental   residential   construction,   and,   in particular, the huge oversupply in eastern Germany (one million   vacant   apartments)   will   continue   to   keep construction  investment  down  in  the  current  year.  In 2001  the  composition  of  growth  is  set  to  change  away from external demand towards domestic demand, which is projected to see a strong acceleration. The advancing of  the  third  step  of  income  tax  reform  from  2002  to 2001,  implying  a  very  important  tax  relief,  combined with a further clear improvement on the labour market, should   induce   a   rise   in   private   consumption   not observed  since  reunification.  Furthermore,  equipment investment  is  projected  to  expand  dynamically  on  the basis of continued good profitability and slightly rising final  demand.  In  spite  of  the  ongoing  problems  in  the construction sector in the eastern Länder, the year 2001 is likely to see a further rise in construction investment, thanks  to  very  high  consumer  sentiment  which  should give a clear impetus to residential construction.   Public consumption,  however,  is  expected  to  grow  only  very moderately, due to the federal government's intention to balance the federal budget by 2006. Labour market. While the drop in external demand also triggered a decrease in employment in the first quarters of 1999, unemployment figures for the fourth quarter of last year seem to indicate that the recovery has now also reached the labour market. With growth accelerating, the current year should see a clear improvement in the labour market and the average number of unemployed is likely   to   fall   below   the   psychologically   important threshold of 4 million. In 2001, the labour market should see   an   even   stronger   reduction   in   the   number   of unemployed,  resulting  from  the  combined  effects  of  a decrease  in  the  labour  force  and  a  stronger  rise  in employment. Prices. Although petrol prices were clearly rising in the course of 1999, prices of imported goods as a whole fell by  0.5%  in  1999  compared  to  the  preceding  year.  In spite of slightly rising unit labour costs and an increase in indirect taxes, the combined effects of falling import prices and only moderately growing private consumption made for a very favourable development of consumer prices (0.6% rise year-on-year). As a result of the strong increase in petrol prices observed in 1999 and in  the  first  months  of  this  year  combined  with  the depreciation of the Euro and also due to another hike in indirect taxes ('ecological tax'), consumer price inflation is  to  rise  in  2000  (1.5%),  in  spite  of  the  dampening effects  of  the  ongoing  liberalisation  in  the  network industries, increased competition in the retail sector and the forecast slight decline in unit labour costs. In 2001, while the strong increase in domestic demand will create some price pressure, the rise in consumer prices should not accelerate, as long as wage moderation prevails and the forecast decrease in petrol prices materialises. Public   Finances. Following   the   better-than-expected result  in  1998,  the  general  government  deficit  in  1999 once again turned out to be lower than expected (1.1% of  GDP  compared  to  an  original  target  of  2%).  This result is mostly due to higher tax revenues in 1999, as a consequence,   in   particular,   of   higher   corporate   and assessed  income  taxes  related  to  1998.  In  2000,  the deficit reduction in Maastricht terms will be lower than the adopted savings package might suggest, among other things,  to  rising  deficits  at  the  regional  and  local  level and  a  decreasing  surplus  of  the  social  security  system. Furthermore,  tax  revenues  should  rise  more  moderatly, due to the implementation of the second step of income tax reform and the lagged effects of low nominal GDP growth  in  1999.  In  2001,  the  implementation  of  the corporate tax reform and the advancing of the third step of  income  tax  reform  -  both  implying  important  tax reliefs  -  will  lead  to  a  deterioration  of  the  general government deficit.		
April/2000	Spain	Economic growth remains strong	Output. GDP rose by 3.7% in 1999 compared to 4.0% in the   previous   year.   This   strong   growth   performance means that GDP has risen by above 3.5% for three years in  a  row.  In  2000  economic  activity  is  expected  to remain   robust,   posting   a   growth   of   3.8%,   with   a different  GDP  composition.  Finally,  in  2001,  although more moderate than in the previous years, output growth is forecast to maintain a strong pace at around 3.4%. GDP  components. In  1999  GDP  growth  was  driven  by domestic  demand  while   the   external   sector   made   a negative    contribution.    The    dynamism    of private consumption  was  due  to  strong  job  creation  and  the personal  income  tax  reform  implemented  in  January 1999,  which  increased  households'  disposable  income. The  strength  of  investment  stemmed  partially  from the historically low interest rates registered in Spain and the acceleration of private consumption. In this respect, it is worth  noting  that  investment,  for  both  equipment  and dwellings,    was    the    most    dynamic    component    of domestic  demand.  Regarding  the  external  sector,  its negative  contribution  came  from  high  import  growth, linked  to  the  strength  of  domestic  demand,  and  the unfavourable  international  setting from the  second  half of 1998 which induced a sharp deceleration of Spanish exports. This was reflected in the current account deficit widening to 1.8% of GDP. In  2000  economic  growth  should  remain  robust,  rising slightly    to    3.8%.    Nevertheless,    a    change    in    its composition   is   foreseen.   Firstly,   a   deceleration   in domestic demand is forecast. Although private consumption  should  remain  strong,  its  growth  should moderate as the main effects of the tax reform fade away and employment should continue growing but at slower pace.  In  addition,  investment,  especially  investment  in dwellings,  should  moderate  its  dynamism due  partly to the   expected   increase   of   interest   rates.   Secondly, Spanish exports should continue recovering gradually as the international setting improves, especially in the EU area,  and  so  make  the  external  sector  contribution  to growth   less   negative.   Recent   data   suggest   that   this change in the composition of GDP growth started taking place  in  the  second  half  of  1999.  In  2001,  GDP  is forecast to record strong growth, although decelerating, with an accentuation of the trends previously envisaged in 2000:  a  more  moderate  domestic  demand  and  a  less negative  contribution  from  the  external  sector  to  GDP growth. Labour  market .   Employment  rose  briskly  by  3.4%  in 1999. In 2000, it is expected to remain strong although decelerating  to  2.8%.  This  moderation  in  job  creation partially  reflects  the  projected  change  in  GDP  growth composition,  more  based  on  a  less  intensive  labour activities. These favourable developments can be partlyexplained    by    the    reforms    to    the    labour    market implemented  in  recent  years,  which  have  improved  its functioning.   Employment   on   a   permanent   basis   is growing faster than fixed-term jobs, although the share of the latter in total employment still remains very high. For  2001,  job  creation  should  continue  rising  but  at  a more  moderate  pace.  As  a  result,  the  still  very  high unemployment  rate  should  keep  on  a  clear  decreasing path during the forecasting period. Prices . In 1999, despite moderate wage growth and core inflation   remaining   stable,   price   developments   were worse than expected in the second half of the year due to the  behaviour  of  the  more  volatile  items,  especially energy  prices.  HICP  inflation  for  1999  thus  posted  a figure  of  2.2%  on  average  compared  to  1.8%  in  the previous year. In 2000 inflation is forecast to accelerate to  2.5%.  However,  the  assumptions  on  oil  prices  from the   second   half   of   2000   and   deceleration   both   in domestic demand and in unit labour costs should help to ease   inflationary   pressures   in   the   forecast   period. Decelerating  unit  labour  costs  should  stem  from  the recovery of productivity which should more than offset the expected rise in compensation per employee. In 2001 inflation is thus forecast to fall to 2.2%. External sector. The current account deficit is expected to widen gradually during the forecasting period. This is due  partially  to  the  worsening  of  the  terms  of  trade  in 2000 and the growing trade deficit which is not offset by the expected surplus in the service balance. Public finances. In 1999 the general government deficit registered  a  figure  of  1.1%  of  GDP  (2.6%  in  1998), lower   than   the   1.3%   previously   envisaged   in   the Stability Programme Update. This deficit reduction was mainly    due    to    the    moderate    growth    of    current expenditure,  the  dynamism  shown   by  indirect   taxes (especially  VAT)  and  the  relative  buoyancy  of  direct taxes despite the personal income tax reform implemented  in  1999.  Additionally,  the  social  security sub-sector recorded a surplus of 0.2% of GDP. For  2000  the  general  government  deficit  is  forecast  at 0.7%  of  GDP  (0.1  percentage  points  lower  than  the figure previously considered  in  the  2000  Budget  Law). The bulk of the deficit reduction is based on restraint of primary  expenditure,  mainly  public  consumption,  and the further reduction in interest payments. Thus, public consumption  is  forecast  to  grow  below  nominal  GDP, partly due to the policy at State and small municipalities levels of replacing no more than 25% of outgoing staff with  new  employees.  This  deficit  reduction  should  be compatible  with  the  continuation  of  an  active  labour policy  and  the  increase  in  public  gross  fixed  capital formation as  a  percentage  of  GDP.  In  2001,  and  under the   assumption   of   no   policy   changes,   the   general government deficit is forecast at 0.4% of GDP. Stemming    from    the    increasing    primary    surpluses coupled with strong growth and the, still, relatively low interest rates for the Spanish economy, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to continue on a declining path during the  forecasting  period.  As  a  result,  after  falling  to  a figure of 63.5% in 1999, the debt ratio is forecast to fall below 60% of GDP in 2001		
April/2000	France	Entering a phase of sustained expansion	Output. After  temporarily  decelerating  around  the  turn of 1999 as a result of the international crisis, economic activity rebounded from the second quarter. The upturn became very robust during the second half of 1999 as a result   of   a   sharp   increase   in   exports   triggered   by accelerating external demand, a weakening euro and by improving  competitiveness.  Together  with  recovery  in exports, domestic demand has been growing steadily, as a   result   of   rising   demand   of   households   and   of companies and, therefore, strong job creation. Households  have  been  feeling  fully  the  effects  of  this improvement  on  the  labour  market,  which  explains  the exceptionally  high  level  of  the  consumer  confidence indicator.   Confidence   surveys   suggest   that   growth should remain healthy during the early months of 2000, but economic activity might have peaked in the second half of 1999. GDP components . Consumer demand, the cornerstone of growth since 1998, is expected to remain buoyant over the forecast period. Households should benefit from the vigour  of  employment  resulting  from  sound  economic performance,  the  positive  effect  of  the  reduction  in working time and the reduction of VAT by 1 percentage point    effective    from    April 2000.    In    parallel,    the purchasing  power  of  household  income  is  likely  to increase slightly faster during the forecast period than in 1999    despite    a    surge    in    inflation.    Furthermore, households' confidence  should  remain  high,  allowing  a fall in their saving ratio. Following the exceptional rate of  growth  in  1999,  housing  investment  is  expected  to decelerate  somewhat.  The  main  reasons  for  this  are slightly  less  favourable  financing  conditions  and  the removal of a very effective tax incentive. Business demand is set to continue to move in line with consumer  demand.  The  high  level  in  overall  industrial demand  prospects,  combined  with  higher  raw  material prices, should lead to renewed stockbuilding. Investment in   equipment   should   remain   sturdy   as   a   result   of acceleration in activity and of a good business financial situation. Exports, fuelled by dynamic external demand both intra- community  and  from  outside  Europe,  are  expected  to perform well. With improved competitiveness, France is expected  to  gain  market  share.  Foreign  trade  should hence  make  a  significant  positive  contribution  to  GDP growth in both 2000 and 2001. Overall, GDP is expected to grow by 3.7% in 2000 and by 3.2% the following year. The forecast assumes some slowdown in activity at the turn of the year 2000 when the strong build-up in inventories realised in the fourth quarter    of    1999    will    be    reversed.    Should    this development not occur, real GDP growth in 2000 might be slightly higher Labour market . The strong pick-up in employment seen in  the  private  sector  in  1999,  along  with  the  boost resulting from employment policies, allowed a reduction in   unemployment.   Supported   by   the   acceleration   in output,  employment  is  expected  to  remain  dynamic  in 2000 but to decelerate somewhat in 2001. At  the  same  time,  apparent  productivity  growth  should edge  up  in  2000  from  1.2 %  to  1.9 %.  Indeed,  the positive  impact  on  employment  of  incentives  aimed  at lowering  labour  costs  introduced  in  1992-1993  on  one hand,  and  the  implementation  of  the  “emplois  jeunes” scheme designed to create jobs for young people in the public  sector  and  associations  on  the  other  hand,  will start to fade away. However, the unemployment rate  is set to continue to fall and should cross the 10% line in the course of 2000. Prices   and   wages .   Despite   above   potential   growth, inflationary pressures are expected to remain weak. The fall  in  unemployment,   although   significant   over   the forecast  period,  is  not   expected   to   be   sufficient   to generate  wage  pressures;  the  introduction  of  reduced working  time  in  company  agreements  already  signed will be accompanied by wage moderation over the next few  years.  Moreover,  since  the  35-hour  working  week entails risks of higher wage costs, it has led enterprises to   restrain   wage   increases   since   1998.   This   should continue    to    prevail    over    the    forecasting    period. Following the deregulation process, increased competition  in  the  services  sector  is  helping  to  narrow margins and even reduce prices. All these factors added to the reduction of VAT are therefore expected to offset the adverse effects of imported inflation to some extent. Public finances . Government finances improved clearly in  1999:  the  deficit  fell  from 2.7%  of  GDP  in  1998  to 1.8%.  This  was  a  better  performance  than  expected  by the government, which had initially planned a deficit of 2.3% of GDP. The outcome was influenced in particular by  buoyant  revenues,  especially  direct  taxes.  Indirect taxes and social contributions also performed well. As a result, the tax burden rose again to reach a record 45.6% of   GDP.   Progress   in   budgetary   consolidation   also resulted from tight control in State spending. In contrast, an   expenditure   slippage   was   registered   on   social security, although most of spending in excess of targets was due to overhang. In  2000  and  2001,  the  favourable  economic  conditions and the continuing restraint in  spending will  create  the conditions for further budgetary consolidation. However,  the  fall  in  the  deficit  ratio  will  be  relatively small, because of the tax cuts announced in September 1999  (budget  for  2000)  and  in  March  2000  (mini- budget), as well as the reductions in social contributions connected with the introduction of the 35-hour working week. The government debt ratio declined in 1999 from 59.3% of GDP to 58.6% (the first fall in the debt ratio for 20 years). Further reductions in the debt ratio are expected in the coming years.		
April/2000	Ireland	Growth to remain strong but slow down	Output  in  1999. Growth  of  GDP  in  Ireland  in  1999  is, yet again, estimated to have been particularly strong at over 8%. All sectors contributed to strong growth. The largest  contribution  was  from domestic  demand  where, in  particular,  households  increased  their  expenditure rapidly in response to rises in real income, wealth and a strong  labour  market.  In  addition,  investment  both  in construction  and  equipment  rose  rapidly.  The  overseas side also contributed modestly to growth; export volume growth  of  goods  outstripped  that  of  imports  as  exports responded  to  recovery  of  growth  in  Ireland's  markets, particularly  the  UK,  and  they  were  also  aided  by  an improvement in competitiveness. Demand  pressures With  an  economy  that  has  been  so dynamic   and   has   enjoyed   remarkable   growth   with relatively  subdued  inflation  until  now,  it  is  difficult  to determine what, even approximately, is the trend rate of growth  and  whether  the  economy  is  actually  working above productive potential. That makes projecting 2000 and  beyond  uncertain.  Certainly  there  are  plenty  of reasons   for   expecting,   if   anything,   demand   in   the economy to accelerate. Retail sales volumes are growing very  rapidly.  The  strong  labour  market,  rising  wealth, especially  that  resulting  from  rising  house  prices,  and the direct tax cuts announced in last December's budget will   maintain   strong   household   expenditure   growth. Further  support  should  come  from  the  external  side. Ireland's  export  markets  are  expected  to  grow  more strongly   into   2000   especially   that   of   the   UK   and Ireland's  competitiveness  has  increased  as  the  euro  has weakened. There are also pressures to raise construction expenditure, in view of both the government intentions to  improve  the  infrastructure  and  current  constraints  in the housing market. Output forecast. The view taken here is that, in response to strong demand, strong GDP growth will continue but, at  7.5%  in  2000,  will  be  lower  than  in  1999  as  supply constraints restrict growth Both actual domestic demand growth  and  export  growth  will  slow  down  a  bit  and strong import growth will accommodate strong demand to some extent. GDP  growth  is  expected  to  fall  a  little more  in  2001  to  average  6.2%  as  supply  restraints continue to bite but some of the demand pressures will fall  -  for  example  a  slowdown  of  growth  in  Ireland's export markets is expected. Labour market . The labour market is expected to tighten but some success in alleviating labour market pressures is expected that can be attributed to the direct tax cuts in December's   budget.   There   is   certainly   scope    for increasing labour participation despite strong growth in employment   in   recent   years.   As   a   result   of   strong demand  and  recent  measures,  employment  is  projected to grow by 3.5% in 2000 and 2.7% in 2001.The  employment  rate  will  rise  from  62.7%  in  1999  to 65% in 2001. Inflation   currently .   Around   the   turn   of   last   year, significant  upward  pressure  on  inflation  emerged.  In February  of  2000,  the  consumer  price  index  was  4.3% up on a year earlier and the HICP rose even more - by 4.6%.  Much  of  the  rise  can  be  attributed  to  specific factors that may not persist - rises in tobacco duty in last December's  budget,  rises  in  import  prices  due  to  euro weakness  and  rises  in  prices  of  petroleum  products associated with the oil price rise. Nevertheless, there are signs  of  more  general  inflationary  pressures  such  as rapidly rising house prices and an acceleration of wages. The  latter  has  been  accompanied  by  larger  rises  in services prices than in the recent past. Inflation expected. Price pressures will rise in reponse to strong  demand  and  supply  constraints.  CPI  inflation averaged only 1.6% in 1999 but is expected to increase. It  will  average  3.5%  in  2000  and  2.8%  in  2001.  Wage inflation is expected to rise moderately over the forecast period  from  6%  in  1999  to  7%  in  2001  though  the assessment  here  is  that  rises  in  wage  inflation  will  be moderated   to   some   extent   by   recognition,   in   wage negotiations, of the tax cuts in December's budget. As a result  some  of  the  inflationary  pressures  may  ease.  In addition, some of the one off factors contributing to high inflation in 2000 disappear. Public  finances. The  public  finances  are  in  very  good shape and posted a surplus of 2% of GDP in 1999. They are expected to remain strong as growth remains robust despite   the   expansionary   nature   of   last   December's budget.  While  they  will  be  distorted,  particularly  in 2000,  as  a  result  of  the  decision  to  pre-fund  future pension commitments, healthy surpluses are expected of 1.7% of GDP in 2000 and 2.7% in 2001. In underlying terms the surpluses would be close to 3% in each year. While it is possible that the economy may be operating above productive potential, in cyclically adjusted terms the  finances  are  still  expected  to  be  in  comfortable surplus.  Gross  debt  is  expected  to  continue  its  rapid decline to under 40% by the end of 2001.		
April/2000	Italy	Economic growth in 1999 remained weak, but strong recovery gaining ground	1999 outcome. In 1999 the Italian economy once again grew  at  a  rate  which  was  significantly  lower  than  the euro   zone   average.   A   number   of   domestic   factors (amongst   these,   the   increasing   fiscal   burden   and fluctuating  consumer  confidence)  have  contributed  to slow down output growth, dampening private consumption   expenditure   and,   to   a   lesser   extent, investment in equipment. The most adverse effect came from  the  external  side  of  the  economy.  Due  to  Italy's export structure and to its position as a relatively large exporter   to   emerging  economies,   the   impact   of   the international  crisis  was  deep  and  long-lasting  and  net exports  subtracted  a  full  percentage  point  to  growth. Annual  average  figures,  however,  do  not  reveal  the reversion  in  the  cycle  which  took  place  during  1999. The recovery was fully underway in the second half of the   year,   despite   a   marked   deceleration   in   private consumption expenditure. Exports surged, fuelled by the favourable   exchange   rate   effect   and   by   improved external  demand,  while  import  penetration  rose,  but more moderately. Outlook. The  recovery  recorded  in  the  second  half  of 1999,  is  expected  to  consolidate  during  the  forecast period.  The  tax  measures  in  favour  of  households  and enterprises    introduced    in    2000,    should    underpin economic  growth,  and  domestic  demand  should  firm over   the   forecast   period.   The   improvement   in   the external  environment  should  contribute  to  strengthen gross fixed capital formation and drive the acceleration of  GDP  in  2000.  In  2001,  external  demand  growth  is estimated  to  contract  somewhat.  The  erosion  of  export market  share  will  continue  but  at  a  substantially  lower rate than in recent years. GDP components . In 2000 and 2001, private consumption should be supported by good employment prospects   and   rising   real   disposable   income,   which should  also  benefit  from  the  income  tax  reductions. Investment in equipment should grow at a sustained rate, thanks   to   improving   demand,   changes   to   the   tax treatment of reinvested profits and incentives introduced in  1999.  Although  in  2000,  investment  in  construction should display stronger average annual growth, the pace is expected to slow markedly during the forecast period with the completion of planned public works. Exports of goods  and  services  should  grow  markedly  in  2000  and decelerate in 2001, in line with the expected evolution of external demand. Sustained  growth  in  exports  of  services  reflect  higher expected receipts from tourism due to the Jubilee 2000. Driven  by  improving  demand,  imports  of  goods  and services  should  accelerate  significantly  in  2000,  and continue   to   grow,   although   at   a   slower   pace,   in 2001.Real net exports are foreseen to provide a positivecontribution  to  GDP  growth  in  2000  and  a  slightly negative contribution in 2001. In both years the current external  balance  should  improve  as  a  percentage  of GDP. Labour   market .   Despite   low   growth,   employment continued  to  increase  in  1999,  benefiting  from  higher labour market flexibility. Supported by the acceleration of output and by initiatives to reduce labour costs in the depressed  areas  in  2000-2001  employment  creation  is expected  to  continue  to  improve  and  unemployment  to decrease. During the period, compensation of employees per head is expected to continue to grow in a framework of wage moderation. Productivity growth should display a marked increase in 2000, resulting in a deceleration in unit labour costs. Prices .  Headline  consumer  price  inflation  has  been  on the  rise  since  mid-1999,  with  annual  rates  above  2.0 percent in the last few months. This increase is largely attributable to the impact of higher energy prices, while wage  dynamics  have  remained  moderate.  The  forecast assumes  that  the  increase  in  consumer  prices  will  be progressively re-absorbed during the year. However, the inflation overhang from 1999 and the first months of this year implies that the annual rate will average around 2.1 percent in 2000. In 2001, the assumptions of continuing wage   moderation   and   of   a   favourable   evolution   in import   prices   support   the   view   that   inflation   will decline. Public finances . Despite much weaker economic growth than   foreseen,   Italy   achieved   a   general   government deficit of 1.9 per cent of GDP in 1999; better  than  the original  objective  of  2.0  percent  of  GDP.  Lower-than- expected interest payments and higher revenues, namely from  improved  tax  collection,  have  contributed  to  this result. However, non-interest expenditures were slightly above   projections.   Compared   to   1998,   the   primary surplus decreased to 4.9 percent of GDP, while interest payments  in  terms  of  GDP  dropped  by  more  than  1 percentage point. For 2000, a general government deficit of around 1.5 percent of GDP is foreseen. The primary surplus  should  stabilise  at  the  same  level  as  last  year. Despite  higher  interest   rates,   interest   payments   will continue  to  decline  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  to  an estimated   6.4   percent,   reflecting   the   fact   that   the increase  in  the  share  of  fixed-interest-rate  and  longer- maturity  securities  in  the  total  debt  has  significantly diminished   the   budget   sensitivity   to   interest   rate movements. Total current resources are projected to fall as  a  percentage  of  GDP,  in  line  with  the  objective  of reducing  the  fiscal  burden.  Total  current  non-interest expenditures are also projected to fall as a percentage of GDP, in accordance with the government's strategy. The scenario  "at  current  legislation"  for  2001,  points  to  a further reduction of the overall budget deficit to 0.8% of GDP.  Thanks  also  to  large  privatisation  receipts  which partly offset the impact of lower growth, the debt/GDP ratio  decreased  to  114.9  percent  in  1999.  It  should continue to decline over the forecast period		
April/2000	Luxembourg	Strong output and employment growth	Growth. The   economy   of   Luxembourg   performed extremely  well  in  1999  with  real  GDP  rising  by  about 5% according to preliminary estimates. This rate is very close  to  that  of   1998,  while  in  1996  and  1997,  GDP growth was around 3%. Since the first half of the 80’s, Luxembourg   has   repeatedly   achieved   growth   rates significantly above the EU average. Private  consumption  increased  in  real  terms  by  about 3% in 1999; slightly more than forecast at the beginning of   the   year.   Investment   was   extremely   dynamic, increasing by about 10% in real terms; however, a large part of this increase was due to the purchase of several large  aircraft,  which  resulted  in  an  equivalent  rise  in imports of goods. Exports significantly decelerated as a  result  of  slowing export  markets:  while  exports  had  increased  by  about 10%  both  in  1997  and  1998,  they  rose  by  only  5%  in 1999; exports of goods being more dynamic and exports of  services  less  dynamic  than  forecast.  This  did  not prevent  the  trade  balance  for  goods  from  deteriorating significantly,   due   to   the   strong   increase   in   goods imports. However, as in previous years, the trade deficit for goods was more than compensated by a huge surplus in  services,  so  that  the  global  surplus  in  goods  and services marginally improved (although it declined as a percentage of GDP). nearly 5% in 1999 as against 3.3% in 1997 and 4.4% in 1998.  The  bulk  of  the  increase  in  employment  (about 80%) occurred in the service sector but employment in industry  and  construction  also  rose.  As  in  previous years, the largest share of the newly created jobs went to frontier-workers,  the  number  of  which  increased  by about 11% and now represents more than 28% of total domestic employment but national employment rose too, by about 2.3%. As a result of rapid employment growth together    with    special    programs    launched    by    the authorities  of  the  Grand-Duchy,  unemployment,  which had slowly increased until 1997, continued, in 1999, the declining   trend   begun   in   1998   ;   the   Eurostat   rate declined from 2.8% to 2.7%. Wages and prices. Wages slightly accelerated to 2.5% in 1999,  this  acceleration  proceeding  partly  from  the  fact that  an  indexation  threshold  was  reached  in  August 1999.  Price  inflation  remained  moderate,  with  the  CPI increasing  by  only  1.0%  in  1999.  However,  this  low figure is partly due to the inclusion of, for the first time in the index, the effects of the January and July discount sales.  Moreover,  CPI inflation  accelerated  significantly throughout the year, reaching 2.0% in the fourth quarter, largely due to the surge in oil prices but also to a slight acceleration  in  core  inflation.  CPI inflation  should  rise to  around  2%  in  2000,  partly because  the  effect  of  the discount sales will not  be  repeated  and  also  due  to  the rise in inflation in the fourth quarter of 1999. Public finances. Luxembourg has continuously registered   considerable   government   net   lending   for several  years.  These  surpluses  amounted  to  3.2%  in 1998 and 2.4% in 1999. Expenditure increased relatively fast, especially public investment, which rose by nearly 15% in value, both in 1998 and 1999 and represented, in recent years, between 4.5% and 5% of GDP, by far the highest percentage in the EU. However, the fast rise in expenditure was easily matched by the rapid increase in tax proceeds and Social Security contributions resulting from strong growth in the economy. Strong growth has also  allowed  government  expenditure  and  revenues  to decline  slightly,  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  since  1995, despite their rapid increase. This favourable situation should not change significantly in coming years: as a result of the expected rapid growth of the economy and the resulting buoyant revenues, the Luxembourg  government  should  continue  to  register comfortable  surpluses.  The  government  debt,  which  is already  by  far  the  lowest  in  the  EU,  has  marginally increased  in  recent  years.  It  should  stabilise  and  even perhaps decline in percentage  of  GDP  in  coming years as  the  Luxembourg  authorities  do  not  envisage  issuing additional debt. The main contributors to GDP growth in 1999 were, as in  previous  years,  market  services:  the  value  added  of financial services increased by more than 7% in volume but    other    services    to    enterprises,    transports    and communications   as   well   as   hotels   and   restaurants achieved similar growth rates. Real  GDP  growth  is  likely  to  speed  up  somewhat  in 2000 and 2001, following the general movement of the EU  economy  and  the  acceleration  in  external  trade. Domestic demand will remain dynamic, private consumption being fuelled, as in recent years, by wage increases   and   intense   job   creation.   Investment   will probably  not  repeat,  in  2000,  the  high  growth  rate recorded in 1999, as it is traditionally extremely volatile in Luxembourg, due to the size of the country. However, the  likely  slowdown  in  equipment  investment  should result  in  a  similar  deceleration  in  imports  of  goods  so that  its  effect  on  GDP  will  remain  minor.  Exports  of goods will benefit from the recovery of external trade in 2000  before  decelerating  somewhat  in  2001  due  to  a slight weakening in export market growth. Employment  and  unemployment. The  main  features  of employment  growth  in  recent  years  were  present  in 1999:  job  creation  was  extremely  strong  and  has  even risen since the mid-90’s, total employment increasing by		
April/2000	Netherlands	GDP  growth  was  robust  in  1999 and   should   be   even   stronger   in 2000	Growth .   Once   more   the   Dutch   economy   performed surprisingly well in 1999. At the beginning of the year, most  observers  expected  the  turmoil  in  several  regions of  the  world  to  result  in  a  significant  slowdown  in activity,   albeit   probably   less   pronounced   than   in neighbouring countries. Yet, real GDP still increased by 3.5% in 1999, little less than the 3.7% recorded in 1998. Supported  essentially  by  internal  demand,  growth  fell less  than  expected  in  the  first  half  of  the  year  and remained around 3% in annual terms. It strengthened in the  second  semester,  especially  in  the  fourth  quarter, together with exports. GDP component s.  In  1999  as  in  previous  years,  strong economic   activity   was   mostly   driven   by   dynamic internal demand. As forecast, exports slowed down from 6.4%   in   1998   to   4.7%,   but   private   consumption remained  buoyant.  It  rose  by  4.1%,  stimulated  by  job creation,  tax  cuts  implemented  in  recent  years,  rising wage  increases  and  wealth  effects  due  to  buoyancy  in the   stock   exchange   and   increasing   houses   prices. Investment, which was expected to slow down sharply in response  to  falling  producers  confidence  in  the  last months  of  1998  and  at  the  beginning  of  1999,  in  the event  slightly  accelerated  from  5.2%  in  1998  to  about 5.7%.  Investment  by  the  government  was  extremely dynamic,  rising  by  more  than   10%   in   volume,   but private   investment   was   also   stronger   than   generally expected. Real GDP growth should speed up to about 4% in 2000 as a  result  of  acceleration  in  external  trade  and  of  still dynamic internal demand. Investment should respond to stronger  demand  and  to  increasing  labour  shortages. Consumption will remain buoyant for the same reasons as  in  recent  years  but  also  because  consumers  will probably anticipate a rise in the standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 19% planned for the beginning of 2001 as part of  a  wide  fiscal  reform  and  by  bringing  forward  their purchases of durable goods in the second half of 2000. In 2001, growth could slow down to 3.7% as a result of a slight deceleration in export markets. Investment might also  decelerate,  partially  because  the  carry-over  effect will  probably  be  smaller  at  the  end  of  2000  than  one year before. Consumption should benefit from the fiscal reform   which,   notwithstanding   the   increase   in   the standard   VAT   rate,   will   lead   to   a   new   significant reduction  in  the  households  tax  burden.  Consumption growth might slow down at the beginning of 2001 after the acceleration due to the anticipation of the increase in the VAT rate but, since this acceleration is expected to occur in the second half of the year 2000, it should raise the yearly growth rate in 2001 as well as in 2000. Employment and unemployment Strong real GDP growth led to a fast increase in employment in 1999 : it rose by about  2.5%,  even  faster  than  in  1998.  As  a  result, unemployment   kept   decreasing   rapidly,   the   Eurostat unemployment  rate  falling  from  4%  in  1998  to  3.2%. Employment should keep rising at around 2.5% a year in 2000 and could perhaps decelerate slightly in 2001. The unemployment  rate  will  fall  to  levels  unseen  since  the early 70's, but presumably not as fast as in recent years. Prices   and   wages. Strong   employment   growth   and rapidly  falling  unemployment  observed  in  recent  years are  positive  developments  but  rising  tensions  on  the labour   market   are   increasingly   becoming   a   major challenge  for  the  Dutch  economy  :  the  long  lasting Dutch  wage  moderation  is  clearly  fading  away  with wage  increases  rising  from  1.4%  in  1996  to  3.7%  in 1999 and unit labour costs from 1.0% to 2.6%, which is significantly more than in neighbouring countries. Such a development, if it were  to  continue,  could  negatively affect the competitiveness of the Dutch economy even if a significant competitive advantage has been accumulated since the early 80’s. However, the increase in  labour  costs  is  less  pronounced  and  the  comparison with  the   neighbouring  countries   less   negative   when considering manufacturing industry, which constitutes a large part of the exposed sector and where the increase in productivity is faster than in the rest of the economy. Wage growth might fall slightly in 2001, provided wage- earners accept a moderation of their wage claims since the   reduction   in   direct   taxes   and   Social   Security contributions,  which  is  part  of  the  fiscal  reform,  will increase after-tax incomes. Despite  the  acceleration  in  wages,  price  inflation  has remained rather moderate until now, the HICP rising by 2.0% after 1.8% in 1998, which is above the EU average but cannot be considered very high after six years of fast growth,   or   by   historical   standards.   However,   CPI inflation is expected to rise to more than 3% at the end of the forecast period, a large part of this rise being due to  rising  import  prices  this  year  and  to  the  increase  in indirect taxes in 2001. Moreover, it should be noted that the  increase  in  the  CPI  in  2000  would  probably  have been about ½% faster had it not been for the suppression of the TV fee at the beginning of the year. Public  finances. Strong  real  GDP  growth  recorded  in 1999 also boosted tax receipts. As a result, the general government deficit, which amounted to 0.8% of GDP in 1998   and   was   at   the   beginning   of   1999   generally expected to rise, eventually turned into a 0.5% of GDP surplus,  the  public  debt  continuing to  fall,  from 67.0% of  GDP  in  1998  to  63.6%.  The  general  government surplus should rise to about 1.0% of GDP in 2000 before decreasing to around 0.4% in 2001 as a result of the tax reform,  because  the  increase  in  indirect  taxes  will  not fully  compensate  for  the  cut  in  direct  taxes  and  social contributions.  The  debt  ratio  will  thus  keep  declining and  fall  below  the  60 %  threshold,  probably  even  in 2000.		
April/2000	Austria	Good   growth   prospects,   but   budgetary pressures remain	Growth. In 2000, output growth in Austria is expected to rise considerably to 3.2%  after  having slowed  down  to an estimated 2.3% in 1999. This expansion  is  due  to  a well-balanced  improvement  in  all  demand  components. The pick-up of export growth in step with the recovery of the economies of Austria’s main trading partners will accompany  the  upsurge  in  domestic  demand,  which already rose considerably faster in 1999. In addition, the remarkable   revival   of   investment   in   equipment   that started  in  the  second  half  of  last  year  should  enhance domestic  demand  in  2000.  In  2001,  a  slight  fall  in growth is projected, when private consumption – while remaining  the  main  engine  of  expansion  –  will  slow down.  In  addition,  due  to  budgetary  restraint  public consumption is expected to stagnate. As a result, annual growth in 2001 should somewhat reduce speed to around 3.0% Demand   components. Private   consumption   growth, boosted by a reduction of income taxes and increases in child  benefits,  is  expected  to  reach  its  peak  in  2000. Underpinned by higher employment, lower unemployment   and   real   wage   increases   households’ disposable income should rise sharply. By contrast, new excise duties to be introduced in June 2000 could have some dampening effect. However, this impact will only be felt fully in 2001, when private consumption should return  to  pre-tax  reform  levels.  Supply  side  conditions will,   in   general,   remain   favourable,   supporting   the resurgence of private investment in equipment. Investment in construction, which decelerated considerably  in  1999,  will  recover  during  the  forecast period  despite  the  continuing  slack  in  the  residential sector.    Net    exports    should,    under    the    expected international  economic  setting,  contribute  strongly  to GDP growth in both 2000 and 2001. Prices  and  wages. In  1999,  Austria  registered  a  record low in post-war inflation despite the pick-up of oil prices at the end of the year. Yet, in view of the oil price hike and   the   closing   output   gap   consumer   prices   are estimated  to  edge  up  in  2000  and  2001,  remaining, however,  rather  moderate  among  euro  zone  countries. Due   to   very   moderate   wage   increases   in   2000   – negotiations took place before rising oil prices translated into  inflation  rates  –  and  relatively  high  productivity growth, unit labour costs will decrease in both 2000 and 2001.  Hence,  as  in  previous  years,  Austria  will  further improve  its  cost-competitiveness  vis-à-vis  its  trading partners  and  export  prices  in  comparison  with  main competitors are expected to decline. Labour market. In  line  with  the  favourable  outlook for production,  employment  growth,  which  was  high  in 1999, is expected to continue in 2000 and 2001, albeit at a slower pace The forecast assumes that the expansion in employment will, to a large extent, be accompanied by a rising labour supply.   As   a   consequence,   employment   gains   will translate only partly into a decline in the unemployment rate. Current account. In the year 1999, the trade and services balance  improved  considerably  thanks  to  a  noticeable recovery of tourism. Despite this favourable development,   the   current   account   deficit   widened significantly owing to a sharp increase in the net outflow of  primary  income  stemming  mainly  from  foreigners’ portfolio  investments.  In  the  year  2000,  the  current account deficit is  expected  to  deteriorate  further  but  to improve   again   in   2001.   In   the   year   2000,   it   is predominantly   the   widening   trade   deficit,   which   is responsible   for   this   decline.   In   nominal   terms,   the expansion   of   imports,   induced   by   buoyant   private consumption  in  particular,  will  more  than  offset  the significant increase in exports. In  addition,  net  outflow of  primary  income  is  expected  to  increase,  albeit  at  a much   slower   pace.   By   contrast,   the   surplus   in   the services  balance  -  after  having  improved  substantially already in 1999 - is expected to rise further in 2000 and in 2001 thanks to the continuing recovery of tourism. In 2001,  when  private  consumption  will  return  to  pre-tax reform  levels,  the  expansion  of  imports  should  slow down somewhat resulting in a lower trade deficit. Public finances . The recent fiscal reform, effective since 1 January 2000, burdens government finances by a total of 1.1% of GDP, of which some 0.9% of GDP weigh on the   year   2000.   While   the   former   government   had adopted the package before general elections in October 1999,   it   failed   to   take   timely   compensatory   action. Moreover, due to  delays  in  forming a  new government after the elections, the budget for the year 2000 has not yet been passed. The Minister of Finance presented the draft budget to parliament on 21 March, thereby starting the  parliamentary  debate.  Due  to  the  obligatory  legal delays,  the  budget  for  2000  is  expected  to  be  adopted towards   the   end   of   May.   Therefore,   this   forecast incorporates expenditure cuts and additional revenue as outlined in the draft budget. The measures known at this stage  are  estimated  at € 2.2  billion  or  some  1.1%  of GDP. Nearly three  quarters  of  these  measures  are  one- off and more than half stem from the revenue side (for details see box 4 in the general section). On this basis, and  thanks  also  to  a  significant  growth  dividend,  the general  government  deficit  in  2000  will  be  reduced  to 1.7% of GDP. This is in conformity with the objective of the stability programme. For the year 2001, however, the outlook is less favourable. Given the predominantly one-off  nature  of  budgetary  consolidation  in  2000  and the underlying structural problems, the general government deficit is expected to widen to 2.0% of GDP in  2001  unless  compensated  by  additional  significant savings   (or   revenues).   Given   the   no   policy   change assumption  of  this  forecast,  only  measures  starting  in 2000 are incorporated, and continued into 2001 - such as staff  reductions  in  the  public  sector  or  increases  in excise duties - as well as action not requiring substantial domestic policy co-ordination (road-pricing, sale of real- estate property).		
April/2000	Portugal	Rebound    of    exports    should    support growth	1999  outcome. GDP  growth  fell  in  1999  due  to  the slowdown   of   both   domestic   and   external   demand. Growth of private consumption is estimated at about 4½ per cent, down from 5¼ per cent a year before, with  a stronger   deceleration   in   the   demand   for   durables. Investment  growth  also  fell  back  from  9¾  per  cent  in 1998 to about 6 per cent in 1999. Both construction and equipment investment weakened. However, the residential construction component remained dynamic as mortgage  credit  developed  vigorously,  contributing  to the  rise  in  the  ratio  of  household  debt  over  disposable income from 66 per cent in 1998 to some 80 per cent at the  end  of  1999.  Total  export  growth  is  estimated  at about  3½  per  cent  as  compared  to  8¾  per  cent  in  the previous   year,   reflecting   the   weakness   of   external demand but also a deterioration in price-competitiveness due to an increase in relative unit labour costs. Growth  outlook. The  outlook  for  2000-01  is  primarily characterised   by  the   composition   of   the   sources   of growth.  In  particular,  domestic  demand  is  expected  to slow down  further.  Private  consumption  is  expected  to decelerate due mainly to the more moderate pace of real disposable income growth. Growth of total investment is forecast  to  remain  at  around  6¼  per  cent,  masking, however,   some   differences   within   the   sector.   More specifically,   investment   in   equipment   is   likely   to accelerate to about just under 10 per cent on the back of brightening prospects for export demand coupled with a relatively high level of capacity utilisation. By contrast, growth of investment in construction is forecast to fall to about  3  per  cent  on  average.  This  is  based  on  a  "soft landing" scenario for the residential construction sector following its exceptionally fast expansion during 1996- 98,  a  projection  which  appears  corroborated  by  recent signs of a moderation of mortgage credit growth. Export  market  growth  for  goods  is  estimated  to  rise  to some  7½  to  8½  per  cent,  making  for  stronger  export growth despite further losses in market shares due to the evolution  of  labour  costs.  As  imports  are  projected  to decelerate  in  step  with  domestic  demand,  the  growth contribution  of  net  exports  should  improve.  This  will, however, not be sufficient to stop the deterioration in the external  balance  of  goods  and  services  underway  for some  years,  which  in  2000  is  partly  also  due  to  a deterioration in the terms of trade. All  considered,  GDP  is  expected  to  grow  by  some  3½ per cent in both 2000 and 2001, as the further weakening of domestic demand is likely to be more than offset by the strengthening of export growth. Prices. Consumer  price  inflation  as  measured  by  the HICP  moderated  significantly  in  the  course  of  1999  to an  average  of  2.2  per  cent,  after  the  winding  down  of some  exceptional  price  rises  in  1998  and  in  the  first quarter  of  1999.  Inflation  is  likely  to  remain  stable  in 2000, although there is an upward risk due to the strong increase in import prices (of energy), the pass-through of which to final users has been delayed due to the policy of stabilising energy prices. Labour  market. Job  growth  in  1999  averaged  almost  2 per  cent.  Despite  a  likely  slowdown,  employment  is expected to continue to grow at a rate of more than 1 per cent per year during the period 2000-01. In tandem with the favourable development of employment, unemployment  is  expected  to  continue  its  decline  to below  4½  per  cent  of  the  labour  force.  The  labour market   will   thus   remain   tight,   putting   pressure   on nominal wages per head, which are projected to rise by about 5 per cent per year. Current   account. Net   external   borrowing   (i.e.   the balance  of  current  transactions  with  the  ROW  plus  the capital balance) is forecast to rise from 5½ per cent of GDP  in  1999  to  approximately  7  per  cent  in  2001, mirroring the evolution of the external balance of goods and services. The counterpart of this rising disequilibrium   in   the   current   account   is   a   rapid accumulation  of  net  external  liabilities  by  households and the financial sector. Public  finances .  In  1999,  the  government  deficit  is estimated  to  have  attained  the  stability  programme's target of 2.0 per cent of GDP. In 2000, the government deficit is forecast to decline to 1.5 per cent of GDP  as projected in the stability programme update. The decline in the deficit reflects strong gains in the efficiency of tax collection as expected in the 2000 budget. However, the recomposition  of  growth  away  from  domestic  demand constitutes  a  downward  risk,  because  the  implicit  tax elasticities assumed in the 2000 budget might turn out to be   too   optimistic,   especially   on   indirect   taxes.   In addition,  current  primary  expenditure  is  expected  to grow  by  about  10  per  cent,  according  to  the  stability programme  update.  To  counterbalance  these  risks,  an important   fraction   of   primary   expenditure   has   been frozen ex ante . Forecasting government finances is also made   rather   difficult   by   the   numerous   tax   changes introduced   in   the   2000   budget    and    uncertainties surrounding  the  implementation  of  capital  expenditure plans  due  to  possible  teething  troubles  with  the  new Community Support Framework.		
April/2000	Finland	Growth  underpinned  by  the  information sector	The "new  economy" .  The  Finnish  economy  is  heavily influenced by the global and domestic growth of sectors associated   with   the   “new   economy”.   A   large   and growing   share   of   output   is   linked   to   information technology  goods  and  services  with  these  contributing significantly  to  Finland’s  international  trade.  This  has important   consequences   in   terms   of   the   economy’s above-average exposure to rapidly evolving international demand  in  these  sectors  and  the  necessity  to  maintain product  competitiveness.  A  benefit  is  the  prospect  of enhanced  proceeds  from  privatisation  of  highly  valued state-owned telecommunications enterprises. The growth  of  the  new  economy  is  significant  in  terms  of economic   assessment   and   policy.   Rapidly   declining prices of information technology products and services, even   as   these   are   constantly   upgraded   in   standard, exacerbates measurement problems in national data and particularly blurs price/volume allocations. It thus makes more difficult an assessment of productivity trends and capacity   utilisation   in   relation   to   output   potential, complicating macro-economic management. Output  growth  in  1999. Last  year,  Finland’s  GDP  rose by 3.5% compared with 5.0% in 1998. Growth thus fell short   of   year-earlier   forecasts   (of   around   4%)   but nevertheless represented a recovery of momentum after the marked externally induced slowdown at the turn of 1998-99.  After  the  weak  performance  in  the  beginning of the year, export growth picked up while import levels grew only slowly. Industrial output decelerated to 5.5% from 7.4% in 1998. In addition to weak export demand in  early 1999,  this  was  partly  due  to  temporary  supply difficulties in the production of  new generation  mobile phones; output recovered very strongly at the end of the year. Final  domestic  demand  was  also  far  less  buoyant than in 1998, contributing 2.4% to overall growth, with private  consumption  up  2.8%  (1998,  4.6%)  and  fixed investment up 4.8% (1998, 7.8%). Outlook. The  economy  entered  2000  on  a  very  strong note,   with   industrial   confidence   having   risen   to   its highest   level   since   early   1998   and   with   consumer confidence  at  its  highest  level  in  the  post-recession period.  The  major  factor  is  the  improved  outlook  in export markets, also helped by the low external value of the euro, which is expected to lead to a rise in economic growth  in  2000  to  approaching  5%.  Exports  are  thus expected  to  pick  up  further.  Information  technology exports   are   expected   to   be   boosted   when   a   new generation   of   mobile   phone   services   become   more widely   available   in   overseas   markets.   However,   a modest deceleration in exports is likely in 2001, due to capacity   constraints   in   heavy   industries,   with   an increased  risk  of  overheating  if  this  slowing  does  not occur. Domestic   demand. Private   consumption   should   be buoyed  by  the  high  level  of  confidence,  real  income gains   and   wealth   effects   from   rising   asset   prices, particularly  of  residential  property.  Households  as  a sector  have  benefited  significantly  from  stock  options and  profit-sharing  schemes  which  should  continue  to support   consumption.   Growth   should   be   sustained through  2000  and  into  2001.  Public  consumption  is expected   to   remain   subdued   as   a   result   of   tight expenditure  limits,  which  for  2001  were  reinforced  at central government level in March 2000 because of the acknowledged   increasing   risks   of   overheating.   As regards  investment,  the  bright  export  outlook  suggests needs   for   increased   industrial   capacity.   In   addition, continuing  high  levels  of  internal  migration  to  urban growth  centres  is  expected  to  stimulate  residential  and other  construction  activity,  although  shortages  of  land zoned  for  construction  and  skilled  construction  labour have  become  increasingly  evident  and  will  constrain growth.  Government  investment,  like  consumption,  is expected to grow more slowly. Labour market. Therateofgrowthofemploymentrose from 2.4% in 1998 to 3.3% in 1999 with most new jobs being   created   in   the   private   services   sector.   The unemployment rate, 11.4% in 1998, declined to 10.2%, already  well  below  recent  estimates  of  the   NAIRU (around 14% for 1999). Henceforth employment growth is  expected  to  decelerate,  and  to  shift  further  from capital-intensive  manufacturing  industry  to  the  more labour-intensive    construction    and    services    sectors. Unemployment   is   expected   to   continue   to   fall,   but eventually at a slower pace due to skill mismatches. Prices. Increasing import prices, due to developments in energy  prices,  contributed  to  a  rise  in  consumer  price inflation  towards  the  end  of  1999.  However,  average consumer price inflation (general index) still fell slightly to 1.2% for the whole year (1998, 1.4%). The full effect of rising import prices on inflation is expected to occur in 2000, with a downward correction after a peak early in  the  year.  Price  developments  for  different  output components  have  been  and  are  likely  to  continue  for some  time  to  be  quite  dispersed.  Investment  prices  in 1999  were  strongly  influenced  by  the  trend  for  high increases  in  the  construction  sector,  which  are  set  to continue.   On   the   external   side   the   terms   of   trade declined  by  about  10%  through  1999  and  a  further worsening  is  expected  for  2000,  with  no  significant change  for  2001.  The  rise  in  the  GDP  deflator  is  thus likely to undershoot the rise in consumer prices. Public   finances .   The   general   government   surplus   is expected  to  increase  rapidly  from  its  level  of  2.3%  of GDP in 1999. As noted above, government expenditure is  expected  to  remain  subdued,  due  to  tight  central government  constraints.  Despite  modest  labour  income tax cuts to be implemented in 2000 and more significant cuts  in  2001,  tax  revenues  from  options,  profit-sharing schemes  and  increases  in  wealth  taxes  are  forecast  to yield    higher    total    tax    receipts.    Although    central government   debt   should   decrease,   the   reduction   in general government debt is forecast to be slowed by the assumption that the social security sector continues on a net  basis  to  disinvest  some  of  its  current  holdings  of government bonds. Offsetting this tendency, the forecast includes privatisation revenues used to amortise debt of FIM 12 billion in 2000, already realised, and an assumed FIM 2.5 billion in 2001.		
April/2000	Denmark	A mild upswing ahead	Output. After five years of strong economic expansion, GDP growth moderated to an estimated 1.4 per cent in 1999.   Growth   in   all   domestic   demand   components slowed down significantly whereas the growth contribution  of  net  exports  improved  remarkably.  In 2000 domestic demand should recover somewhat, while export growth is expected to remain robust in line with the acceleration of  Danish  export  markets.  Overall,  the economy  is  forecast  to  grow  by  some  2.0  per  cent.  In 2001  the  scenario  should  turn  out  to  be  rather  similar and  GDP  growth  is  projected  to  edge  up  to  slightly above 2 per cent. GDP components. Under the impact of the contractionary  fiscal  package  (the  "Whitsun  package"), which was adopted in order to dampen domestic demand and  thereby  avoid  a  situation  of  overheating  of  the Danish economy, the growth rate of private consumption decelerated substantially - from 3.5 per cent in 1998 to some   0.6   per   cent   in   1999.   In   addition,   a   strong correction   of   inventories   exerted   a   drag   on   output growth.   Exports   developed   vigorously,   one   of   the probable  reasons  being  that  Danish  companies,  which earlier focused on serving a strong home demand turned to export markets. Growth in imports, on the other hand, was moderate, in step with the weakening of growth in domestic  demand.  In  line  with  the  improvement  of  net exports,  the  current  account  (excluding  Greenland  and the  Faroe  Islands)  improved  strongly,  from a  deficit  of 15.2  billion  DKK  in  1998  to  a  surplus  of  some  10.6 billion DKK in 1999. In   2000,   private   consumption   should   regain   some strength  as  the  real  disposable  income  of  households will resume rising. The rise in investment in equipment, which  continued  to  be  surprisingly  strong  in  1999,  is likely   to   moderate,   in   particular   as   profits   in   the manufacturing sector were squeezed in the course of last year. Construction investment should continue to decline as large infrastructure projects will be finalised in 2000 and as the progressive lowering of the tax deduction of interest  payments  on  mortgage  loans,  included  in  the Whitsun  package,  has  caused  a  large  fall  in  housing starts.  Exports  should  continue  to  perform  well  since external   demand   is   expected   to   recover   in   2000. However,    Denmark   -    following    high    wage    rises combined  with  low  productivity  increases  over  recent years  - is  expected  to  experience  a  further  loss  in  cost competitiveness.  Regarding  imports,  the  elasticity  of imports  to  final  demand  is  assumed  to  normalise  and, thus, the growth contribution of net exports should turn out lower than in 1999. In 2001 the growth contribution of domestic demand is expected to be slightly stronger. Private  consumption  is  forecast  to  strengthen  further, investment   in   equipment   is   assumed   to   pick   up somewhat  and  the  decline  in  construction  investment should  be  less  marked.  On  the  other  hand,  the  growth contribution of stocks should not be as pronounced as in 2000.  The  contribution  of  net  exports  is  projected  to remain at a similar level as in 2000. Employment/unemployment. Employment creation, which  up  to  1998  was  very  strong,  was  much  more subdued  in  1999.  While  the  number  of  jobs  in  the manufacturing  sector  declined  in  response  to  weaker demand,   employment   growth   in   the   services   sector remained  strong.  Employment  is  expected  to  increase slightly over the forecast period from the estimated end- of-1999  value.  Registered  unemployment  continued  to decline  throughout  1999,  reaching  at  the  beginning  of 2000,  its  lowest  level  since  the  1970's,  but  is  likely  to edge up slightly over the forecast period. Wages. Collective  negotiations  for  the  private  sector were  concluded  in  February  this  year.  The  agreements include  an  additional  week  of  paid  annual  leave  and  a rise  in  employers'  social  security  contributions.  The agreements will be phased in over a period of four years and  are  expected  to  raise  wage  costs  by  around  1  per cent   each   year.   To   these   costs,   the   results   of   the upcoming  wage  negotiations  at  company  level  need  to be  added.  These  negotiations  will  prove  important  in order not to further add to inflationary pressures in the Danish economy. Prices. The  harmonised  consumer  price  index  rose  by 2.1  per  cent  in  1999,  which  compares  with  an  average increase of 0.6 per cent for the three Member States with the lowest inflation. The strong rise in consumer prices last  year  was  boosted  by  a  rise  in  energy  taxes  that contributed  to  the  overall  increase  by  some  0.5  of  a percentage  points.  Domestic  inflationary  pressures  are expected  to  ease  in  2000  as  the  impact  of  the  weaker internal demand feeds through, but due to the oil price hike inflation is forecast to reach 2.4 per cent in 2000, before declining in 2001. Public  finances. Danish  general  government  finances remain   in   a   solid   position.   In   1999   the   general government surplus reached 3.0 per cent of GDP and for 2000 and 2001 budget surpluses of 2.4 and 2.5 per cent of    GDP    are    projected.    The    general    government consolidated  gross  debt  is  expected  to  be  reduced  to close to 46 per cent of GDP by the end of 2001.		
April/2000	Greece	Nominal and real convergence gain momentum	GDP growth and its components. Real output decelerated   slightly   in   1999   as   a   result   of   slower external demand but remained above the EU average for a   fourth   consecutive   year.   All   the   components   of domestic  demand  were  buoyant,  in  particular  private consumption and investment in  equipment;  in  addition, exports   of   services,   mainly   tourism,   compensated slowing   exports   of   goods   and   the   overall   external balance   improved   for   the   second   consecutive   year. Growth  prospects  should  improve  further  in  2000  and 2001: domestic demand will be driven by consumption, boosted  by higher  disposable  income  as  a  result  of  the September 1999 tax and benefit package and by falling interest  rates.  The  latter  will  also  support  investment, particularly  in  construction.  Investment  in  housing  is expected to accelerate due to reparations from the 1999 Athens earthquake. Real output growth is forecast to be close to 4% to the end of the forecast period. Labour   market .   The   situation   in   the   labour   market showed   signs   of   improvement   in   1999.   Sustained activity  and  the  announced  plans  for  structural  reform are  expected  to  support  further  improvement  in  the remainder of the forecast period. Real wages decelerated further in 1999, reflecting the restrictive incomes policy in  the  public  sector  and  the  two-year  collective  wage agreement  in  the  private  sector  which  provided  for nominal   wage   increases   on   the   basis   of   expected inflation. The agreement expired at the end of 1999 and another  one  will  be  signed  in  2000.  Wage  increases  in 2000 will incorporate the year-end increase in prices in excess  of  projected  inflation  for  end-1999,  which  is equal to 0.7%. The positive impact of the tax and benefit package  on  disposable  income  and  the  moderate  wage increases  in  the  public  sector,  included  in  the  2000 Budget, are expected to affect future wage negotiations positively.  Unit  labour  costs  are  forecast  to  rise  at  a moderate pace in 2000 and 2001. Prices .  Favourable  developments  in  unit  labour  costs and in international commodity prices were reflected in the downward trend of consumer price inflation until the third quarter of 1999; since then, the situation has been reversed  under  the  pressure  of  surging  oil  prices.  The national   index   of   consumer   prices   increased   by   an annual  average  of  2.6%  in  1999  down  from  4.8%  in 1998. In February 2000, the index rose by 2.9%  (year- on-year).    Nonetheless,    underlying    trends    point    to improving  inflation  prospects:  CPI  inflation  excluding fresh  fruit  and  vegetables  and  fuels  has  been  on  an uninterrupted  downward  trend  since  August  1998  and has  been  rising  below  the  headline  rate  since  October 1999. The gap between the increases of prices of goods and services is also narrowing at a rapid pace. In  the  remainder  of  the  forecast  period,  a  number  of factors   will   push   price   developments   in   opposite directions.  On  one  hand,  inflation  pressures  are  most likely  to  emerge  from  the  monetary  easing  implied  by the  fall  in  interest  rates  and  from  international  price developments. On the other hand, price stability may be supported by fiscal tightening in  particular  in  2001,  by the increase in competition in the markets of goods and services following announced structural reforms and the liberalisation   of   the   markets   and   the   much   smaller downward exchange rate adjustment needed now for the drachma  to  return  to  its  ERM  central  parity,  following the  revaluation  on  17  January  2000.  In  addition,  with respect to interest rates, given delays in the transmission mechanism  of  monetary  policy  on  inflation  in  Greece, the  timing  of  the  undoubtedly  sizeable  reduction  may imply that its effect will be felt in late 2001 or even after the   time   horizon   of   this   forecast.   Finally,   despite uncertainty as regards the outcome of wage negotiations, wage inflation is not expected to emerge, in particular in view   of   the   acceleration   in   productivity   and   the relatively high rate of unemployment. Public  finances .  The  public  finances  have  posted  an uninterrupted improvement since 1994. In November 1999,  the  Council  abrogated  its  decision  on the  existence  of  an  excessive  deficit  in  Greece.  Fiscal consolidation  gained  further  momentum  in  1999.  The initial  tightening  proposed  with  the  1999  budget  was much  stronger  as  the  general  government  deficit  was reduced  to  1.6%  of  GDP  from 1.9%  set  in  the  budget. This   was   the   result   of   considerably   higher   budget revenues,  reflecting  further  progress  in  combating  tax evasion and the strengthening of domestic demand. The  budget  for  2000,  targets  a  deficit  for  the  general government of 1.2% of GDP  while  the  1999  update  of the convergence programme projects a deficit of 0.2% of GDP  in  2001  and  a  surplus  of  0.2%  of  GDP  in  2002. Nonetheless,   uncertainty   related   with   interest   rate developments    in    2000    and    with    primary    current expenditure,  in  particular  in  2001  implies  a  slightly slower   fiscal   adjustment   in   the   remainder   of   the forecasting  period:  the  general  government  deficit  is forecast to be 1.3% and 0.6% of GDP in 2000 and 2001 respectively. The primary surplus, after having reached 5.8%  of  GDP  in  1999,  is  expected  to  remain  broadly stable to the end of the forecasting period. Thus, in both 2000 and 2001, the reduction of the general government deficit will be mostly the result of lower debt servicing costs, following the expected fall in interest rates. Debt    ratio .    The    correction    of    fiscal    imbalances, combined  with  allocation  of  privatisation  receipts  to pay-off public debt resulted in reducing the debt ratio in 1999  for  a  third  consecutive  year.  The  expected  high level   of   primary   surplus   throughout   the   forecasting period is expected to support the downward path of the debt  ratio,  which  is  forecast  to  fall  below  100%  at  the end of 2001.		
April/2000	Sweden	Buoyant demand leads to continued strong output growth	Output. The   Swedish   economy   performed   strongly despite  the  pessimistic  outlook  that  prevailed  at  the beginning of last year and real GDP accelerated to 3.8% in 1999. Growth has been sustained mostly by domestic demand, with both private consumption and investment achieving high growth rates. In 1999, private consumption   rose   by   4.1%,   strongly   supported   by spending  on  durables  and  in  particular  on  new  cars. Gross fixed capital formation rose strongly, by 8.1% in 1999,   resulting   from   strong   growth   in   equipment investment and, partly in order to secure the millennium transition, computer software investment. However, the external side also contributed, with relatively strong net exports during 1999. Despite a weakening of demand for Swedish  exports  in  several  important  export  markets, total exports grew relatively well in 1999. Imports were weak  during  the  first  half  of  the  year  and  increased relatively slowly in  1999.  Growth  of  domestic  demand was    sustained    by    continued    favourable    monetary conditions  for  the  most  part  of  last  year.  However,  the acceleration  of  inflation  towards  the  end  of  1999  in combination  with  expectations  of  higher  inflationary pressures ahead, led the Riksbank to raise the repo-rate twice; first in November 1999 and again in February this year  to  3.75%.  The  strong  growth  of  the  economy  is generally considered to have resulted in a closing of the output gap. Inflationary pressures are therefore projected to rise over the forecast period and inflation is projected to reach  2%  in  2001.  Nevertheless,  the  outlook for  the Swedish economy is positive and strong demand growth should be accommodated by good output growth without inflation  necessarily  rising  beyond  this  number.  With high consumption and high employment growth, GDP is expected to continue to grow well above trend at 3.9% in 2000 and at 3.3% in 2001. GDP  components. Household  consumption  is  expected to  grow  strongly  over  the  forecast  period,  due  to  the increase   in   both   employment   and   household   wealth stemming  from  the  strong  asset  prices.  In  particular, house   and   equity   prices   have   risen   strongly   (the Stockholm Stock Exchange has surged by 75% between 1   October   1999   and   1   March   2000).   In   2000, consumption   should   continue   to   grow   well   with consumer  confidence  running  at  peak  levels  and  retail sales  growing  briskly  in  the  beginning  of  this  year. Furthermore,  the  tax  cuts  introduced  in  the  budget  for 2000,  totalling  some  0.7%  of  GDP,  should  stimulate spending.  However,  the  strong  growth  of  spending  on durables  is  expected  to  ease  slightly  in  2001.  In  2000, construction   investment   is   set   to   accelerate   while surveys suggest less rapid equipment investment. As  demand  slows  down  in  2001,  investment  growth  is expected   to   weaken,   although   housing   is   likely   to continue to grow robustly. In 2000, exports are projected to  accelerate,  as  economic  growth  among  the  main trading   partners   picks   up.   In   particular,   the   strong performance in the telecom    and pharmaceutical industries  is  expected  to  accelerate  further.  In  2001, export growth should however slow down somewhat as external   demand   moderates.   With   strong   domestic demand, in particular household consumption expenditure, and the stock correction in industry, which lowered  import  demand  for  input  goods,  coming  to  an end, imports are expected to grow faster in 2000 and in 2001. Prices. While inflation remained low in 1999, averaging 0.3% as measured by the CPI, it accelerated towards the end of last year, fuelled by the strong increase in output and   the   sharp   increase   in   petrol   prices.   This   has prompted  the  Riksbank  to  raise  interest  rates  on  two occasions.  As  output  continues  to  grow  above  trend  in 2000  and  2001,  inflationary  pressures  should  increase and  inflation  could  accelerate  towards  2%  by  2001. There is however a strong likelihood that the Riksbank will  successfully  fulfil  its  task  in  ensuring  that  the inflation  target,  of  2%  +/-  1  percentage  point,  is  not breached,  though  with  some  further  tightening  of  the monetary policy stance. Labour market. Employment grew substantially by 2.2% during  1999  and  unemployment  fell  by  1.3  percentage points to 7.0%. However, employment growth flattened in   the   second   half   of   1999   and   the   reduction   of unemployment slowed down. Nevertheless, with buoyant  demand  and  currently  high  numbers  of  job vacancies,    further    employment    growth    and    lower unemployment  is  expected  over  the  forecast  period. Although   wage   settlements   are   moderate   for   most sectors  of  the  economy  in  1999  and  2000,  wages  are expected  to  accelerate  in  2000.  This  is  because  some sectors appear to face increasing difficulties in recruiting staff. More sectors are expected to expand staffing this year and next  and  this  could  lead  to  an  acceleration  in wages, as the labour market tightens further. Public finances. The efforts made to reduce the general government deficit since the early nineties have proven successful   and   Sweden   now   exhibits   sound   public finances, and a surplus of 1.9% of GDP was recorded in 1998. The favourable economic position and  continued adherence to the central government expenditure ceiling resulted in a surplus of 1.9% of GDP also, in 1999. In 2000,  the  surplus  is  expected  to  increase  to  2.4%  of GDP as good growth continues, despite the lowering of taxes. Debt relative to GDP is projected to fall to almost 60% of GDP in 2000 and further to some 55% at the end of 2001. The credibility of the government’s ability not to breach the expenditure ceiling for central government is strong.

April/2000	United Kingdom	Good growth expected in 2000 and 2001	Output  in  1999. The  UK  economy  recovered  strongly during the course of 1999 as UK export markets in both Asia and Europe recovered and as a result of monetary easing  up  until  the  middle  of  the  1999.  Growth  was driven mainly by the strength of household expenditure, buoyed by confidence, rises in real wages and a rise in wealth  as  well  as  the  monetary  easing.  However,  also, fixed  investment  continued  to  grow  strongly.  Further, exports recovered strongly in the second half of the year, despite  sterling's  strength,  as  UK  markets  recovered. GDP  grew  by  2%  in  the  year  as  a  whole  but  in  the second  half   of   the   year,   growth   was   more   rapid   - probably above trend. The economy was also estimated to be operating around productive potential. Forecast   output. The   strong   recovery   in   domestic demand in the second half of last year is likely to have continued into 2000. As a result, in part, of this recent strong  growth,  the  Monetary  Policy  Committee  (MPC) of the Bank of England raised the repo rate four times, from last June, in steps of quarter  percentage  points  to six percent currently. This was to ensure that the target of  inflation  of  2.5%  for  RPIX  inflation  (Retail  prices less   mortgage   interest   payments)   is   not   breached. Although  monetary  policy  has  been  tightened,  GDP  is still forecast to accelerate in 2000 as a whole, to 3.3%. Looking towards 2001, some slowing down of growth is expected  as  the  full  impact  of  monetary  tightening  is felt.   Further,   the   growth   in   UK   export   markets   is expected to slow. However, the fundamentals of a strong labour   market,   and   rising   real   wages   as   well   as continued good growth in investment will maintain GDP growth at relatively high levels. As a result GDP growth of   3%   is   forecast.   The   assessment   on   which   these forecasts   are   based   is   that   the   economy   can   grow somewhat  above  trend,  on  average,  in  2000  and  2001 without   much   in   the   way   of   increased   inflation pressures. This is for two reasons. One, because recent and  expected  rises  in  fixed  investment  should  raise capacity  to   allow   such   growth.   Two,   recent   labour market  measures  taken  should  alleviate  serious  upward labour market pressures. Output    components .    As    far    as    components    are concerned, one reason for strong growth is that growth in household consumption will remain strong. It will be the  major  contributor  to  growth  as  the  labour  market continues  to  strengthen,  real  wages  rise  and  consumer confidence  continues  at  a  high  level.  Further,  exports will  grow  more  rapidly  than  in  1999  as  UK  markets grow strongly, despite a  loss  in  export  competitiveness resulting   from   sterling's   recent   strength.   Investment expenditure  will  rise  -  stimulated  by  planned  rises  in government investment and the cheapness of imports of equipment investment as a result of sterling's strength Labour Market. The labour market strengthened in 1999 and  unemployment  fell  to  a  twenty  year  low  of  5.9%. Pressures  on  the  labour  market  were  associated  with  a rise  in  headline  wage  inflation  towards  the  end  of  the year  -  put  at  5.9%  in  January  -  though  special  factors associated with bonus payments and the millenium bug may  have  inflated  the  figure.  The  labour  market  is forecast to strengthen again with employment rising and unemployment  continuing  to  fall  to  average  5.5%  in 2000. Labour productivity growth is expected to pick up and will be a modest 2% or so. A tighter labour market may  put  upward  pressure  on  wage  inflation  but  recent labour  market  measures  to  make  work  pay  as  well  as measures  to  get  they  unemployed  back  to  work,  will ease  these  pressures  -  enabling  the  economy  to  grow above trend for a while but at the same time maintaining broad price stability. Prices. Inflation  based  on  the  target  measure  of  RPIX (retail  prices  index  less  mortgage  interest  payments) remained moderate in 1999, indeed, around the target of 2.5%  on  average.  It  was,  in  February,  below  target  at 2.2%  and  HICP  inflation  was  even  lower,  among  the lowest in the EU, at 1.0%. The forecast assumes that the Bank of England will operate monetary policy to secure the  inflation  target.  Since  domestic  demand  is  growing strongly  and  output  is  around  potential,  there  could  be upward  pressures  on  inflation  over  the  forecast  period. That may imply some, but not much, raising of the repo rate  from its  current  6%  level.  Inflation  is  expected  to rise a little, based on  the  private  consumption  deflator. However,  this  is  consistent  with  the  target  indicator  of inflation  being  around,  or  just  below,  target  of  2.5%. HICP inflation will be rather lower at around 1.5%. External balance. The current account is projected to be in modest deficit of around 1.5% of GDP but this is not thought to constitute a major imbalance. Public   finances. The   general   government   finances posted a strong surplus of 1.2% of GDP in 1999 and, as the   economy   was   operating   around   potential,   the cyclically  adjusted  balance  was  also  in  surplus  of  a similar magnitude. The budget of 2000 was moderately stimulatory  and,   in   particular,   increased   expenditure from   previous   plans.   Nevertheless   the   finances   are expected to remain in surplus, albeit declining, in 2000 and 2001 as revenues will be sustained by sound growth in activity. Gross debt will fall to around 40% of GDP by the end of 2001		
November/2000	Belgium	Robust economic growth and improved public finances	Output . Improved export performance should lead to an acceleration in economic activity in 2000 bringing GDP growth to 3.9%, the highest growth rate since 1988. For 2001  and  2002,  a  slower  GDP  growth  is  projected, remaining,  however,  robust  at  rates  somewhat  above 3%. The negative effect of higher oil prices on  growth should   be   modest   and   is   not   expected   to   affect significantly the behaviour of economic agents or put at risk the competitiveness of the economy. A basic feature of  economic  growth  over  the  forecast  period  is  its balanced, broad-based character, supported by sustained private  consumption,  healthy  investment  spending  and continuing  positive  contribution  of  net  exports.  The contribution of the external sector to GDP growth, about 1 percentage point in 2000, should result from a strong revival  of  exports  which  started  in  the  last  quarters  of 1999, after a weak first semester, and is still robust. In the course of the year, the open economy of Belgium has benefited   from   the   economic   performance   in   the European Union and in the rest of the world. Sources  of  growth. Private  consumption  should  remain strong  throughout   the   forecast   period,   supported   by growth in employment and incomes. Positive expectations  related  to  prospects  of  lower  tax  burden made    possible    by    improved    public    finances    are supportive    of    households    confidence    and    should attenuate   the   negative   impact   of   the   oil   price   rise, notably    if    this    is    perceived    as    temporary.    The households’    savings    rate    is    expected    to    decline marginally in 2000; some modest reversal of its falling trend, observed for a number  of  years,  should  occur  in 2002, in line with a rise in non-labour incomes. Business investment  is  projected  to  grow  at  rates  above  5%  per year, enhancing the productive potential of the economy. Healthy  companies  profitability,  high  rates  of  capacity utilisation  and  preserved  price  competitiveness  suggest that the projected investment rates are attainable. Public investment, which grew strongly, by 13.5%, in 1999, as is  traditionally  the  case  in  the  year  preceding  local elections,  is  estimated  to  grow  this  year  by  6%  and return to lower growth rates, about 3.5%, in the next two years. Stockbuilding should have a positive contribution to  growth  in  2000  after  a  large  reduction  of  stocks  in 1999.   Increase   in   external   demand   and   preserved international competitiveness due to contained domestic costs,  are  expected  to  boost  exports  in  2000  and  keep their  growth  rate  robust,  though  lower,  in  2001  and 2002.  Sustained  domestic  demand  would  keep  imports relatively high over the forecast period. Labour  market .  The  positive  trends  observed  in  the labour market in recent years should continue, supported by    sustained economic activity    and government measures aimed at promoting employment. Employment growth is estimated at 1.3%, or about 50.000 persons, in 2000 and somewhat higher in each of the next two years, while  the  unemployment  rate  should  decrease  further. The  reduction  in  social  security  contributions,  which was enhanced this year, has been a key policy measure towards   lowering   labour   costs   and   increasing   the attractiveness  of  labour  as  a  production  factor.  The employment  rate  (total  employment  in  proportion  to population  of  working  age),  which  is  relatively  low  in Belgium, is projected to rise by 1.6 percentage points to 59.4% by 2002. Prices and wages . The acceleration in consumer prices in 2000 is to be attributed basically to the impact of the sharp   rise   in   the   price   of   oil,   compounded   by  the depreciation of the euro; the impact of domestic costs on the  rise  of  inflation  has  been  limited  due  notably  to prevailing wage moderation; it is noted that most energy products are excluded from the “health index” which is generally  used   as   reference   for   wage   indexation   in Belgium.  Consumer  price  inflation,  estimated  at  2.7% this year, as measured by the HICP, would fall to around 2% in 2001 and still lower in 2002, as the effect of the oil  price  hike  would  diminish  and  the  euro  effective exchange rate stabilise. Some upward pressure on wages should  be  expected  from  tightening  labour  market  and labour  shortages  in  specific  areas,  in  the  coming  two years;  however,  in  general,  wage  moderation  should continue  to  characterise  labour  market  developments; concern    to    maintain    international    competitiveness should   also   contribute   to   contain   price   increases. Enhanced  competition  within  the  integrated  European market,    in    particular    in    key    sectors    subject    to liberalisation  such  as  telecommunications,  should  also contribute to limit inflationary pressures. Public   finances .   The   expected   equilibrium   in   the budgetary  position  of  the  general  government  in  2000, which would turn into a surplus as from 2001, provides a visible sign of the successful fiscal consolidation effort pursued   by   Belgium   for   a   number   of   years.   The budgetary  adjustment  is  projected  to  continue  in  the coming   years   centred,   as   in   the   recent   past,   on expenditure  control  and  the  creation  of  high  primary surpluses.  This  fiscal  consolidation  strategy,  supported also  by  the  reduced  interest  payments  as  percent  of GDP,  should  make  possible  the  reduction  of  the  still very high government debt ratio by 17 percentage points in three years, to 99.2% of GDP at the end of 2002. The budget for 2000 and the multi-annual programme 2001- 2005, both presented on 17 October 2000, confirm these trends while pursuing the parallel objective of reducing the  tax  burden.  Total  government  expenditure  and  the tax burden are indeed projected to fall, as percentage of GDP, by the end of the forecast  period.  Public  finance projections for 2001 include receipts of 0.6 billion euro, about  0.24%  of  GDP,  corresponding  to  the  minimum amount fixed by the government for the sale of UMTS licences.		
November/2000	Germany	Mild growth slowdown following a strong year 2000	Output. The   year   2000   will   result   in   the   strongest economic   performance   since   the   unification   boom. Compared to a growth rate of only 1.6 % in 1999, output growth in 2000 will attain an annual rate of some 3 %. The  economic  recovery  was  particularly  strong  in  the first half of the year, with annual growth of 3.3 %. The main  driving  force  for  this  growth  is  a  particularly strong   export   performance,   which   benefits   from   an expanding world economy and marked improvements in the  international  competitiveness.  These  result  in  turn from  a  remarkable  degree  of  wage  moderation  and  a decline  in  the  effective  exchange  rate.  While  export growth  remains  the  mainstay  of  the  current  upswing, domestic   demand   is   gathering  momentum,   too.   The favourable   economic   climate   has   led   to   a   rapid expansion  of  equipment  investment,  underpinned  by robust increases of orders, in particular from abroad, and rising   capacity   utilisation   rates.   In   parallel,   private consumption is gaining some strength as a result of rapid employment growth. The dampening effect of higher oil prices  on  the  economic  performance  of  the  year  2000 has remained limited so far. Growth outlook. Growth rates in 2001 and 2002 should be  in  the  order  of  2.8 %,  which  is  only  slightly  lower than the present year. The main dampening factor is the rise in oil prices, which has shaved off several tenths of a  point  from  the  real  purchasing  power  of  households and contributes to a lower level of consumer confidence. In  addition,  business  climate  has  started  to  weaken,  as companies expect lower profits as a result of higher oil prices and higher interest rates. Furthermore, in light of a  still  negative  output  gap  and  a  comparatively  low inflation  rate  the  present  cycle  of  tightening  monetary conditions   will   affect   the   German   economy   more strongly  than  other  euro  area  countries.  Recent  figures for   production   and   orders   have   weakened   and   the closely   watched   Ifo   business   confidence   index   has declined for four months in a row, which is an indication of a deceleration of output growth in the period ahead. Nevertheless,  the  indicator  remains  at  a  high  level, which implies that solid growth rates remain attainable. Indeed, in 2001 much of the impact of these dampening factors   will   be   balanced   by   the   third,   and   most important,  step  of  the  German  tax  reform,  which  will increase  net  household  incomes  close  to  1 %  in  2001 and  reduce  corporate  taxes.  As  a  consequence,  private consumption  should  grow  at  a  healthy  pace  in  2001, while  investment  growth  should  remain  robust.  Even though  the  effects  of  the  tax  reduction  will  wear  off somewhat and fiscal policy will return to a more neutral stance   in   2002,   it   is   expected   that   most   of   the momentum  is  kept,  as  the  German  economy  continues on   a   virtuous   circle   of   higher   employment,   higher consumption and lower taxes on labour including social security  contributions.  The  forecast  assumes  that  the wage   round   of   2002,   in   which   long-term   wage agreements  are  due  to  be  renewed,  will  not  result  in excessive  wage  demands  that  break  this  circle.  As  a consequence, business climate should remain favourable and   cost   competitiveness   maintained,   with   German exports continuing to grow at a rate of around 8 % per annum. Employment. Sturdy  output   growth   has   substantially stimulated demand for labour. The employment level in 2000 rose by some 1½ % and, due also to demographic developments, unemployment figures fell to 3.7 millions, the lowest level since 1995. Further strong increases in employment by around 1 % are expected for 2001  and  2002,  presupposing  a  continuation  of  wage moderation. In headline figures, however, this improvement appears to  have  bypassed  so  far  completely the  Eastern  part  of the  country.  Nevertheless,  even  in  the  "New  Länder", there  are  encouraging  signs  of  improvement.  Behind stagnant unemployment figures, one can detect substantial structural improvements. Falling employment  in  highly  subsidy-dependent  areas  such  as construction,   the   government   sector   and   make-work schemes is compensated by a rapidly rising demand for labour  in  the  -  admittedly  still  small  -  manufacturing sector.  The  trend  should  continue  in  coming  years  as unit  labour  costs  continue  to  improve  compared  to  the West. Inflation. The  rise  in  oil  prices  has  contributed  to  a significant acceleration of consumer prices, bringing the annual price increase to a level of 2.6 % in October. On average,  consumer  prices  (HICP)  will  rise  by  around 2.0 % in 2000. Remarkably, core inflation has remained practically  unchanged  since  1999,  hovering  around  a level   of   1.3 %.   It   is   expected,   however,   that   core inflation accelerates somewhat in 2000, as the projected rise  in  domestic  demand  should  allow  companies  to raise prices. First indications of this can be found in the strong increase  in  producer  prices,  where  latest  figures point  to  a  5.7 %  increase  year  on  year.  Nevertheless, since no additional pressures from the external side are assumed   and   unit   labour   costs   will   rise   only   very moderately the average annual inflation should again fall below  2 %  in  2001.  With  many  of  the  present  wage agreements  running  out  by  the  end  of  2001,  there  is  a risk  that  labour  unions  might  bid  up  wage  demands unduly following the loss in purchasing power caused by higher  oil  prices.  Clearly,  this  would  exert  additional upward  pressure  on  inflation  in  2002.  However,  this forecast  assumes  that  wages  increases  in  2002  will remain   within   reasonable   limits,   which   should   also permit a further marginal decline in headline inflation as compared to 2001. Public Finance. Owing to the UMTS proceeds of € 50.8 billions (2.5 % of GDP), in the current year the overall government  balance  will  reach  a  surplus  of  around 1½ % of GDP.   Net of these receipts, there would have been   a   deficit   of   about   1 %   of   GDP,   following   a (revised)  deficit  of  1.4 %  for  1999.  As  in  1999,  the outcome   in   the   current   year   has   been   favourably influenced by clearly higher tax revenues than originally projected.  Due to the important tax relief implied by the implementation  of  reforms  of  corporate  and  income taxes,  a  clear  deterioration  of  the  general  government deficit  to  some  1½ %  of  GDP  has  to  be  expected  for 2001, in spite of ongoing expenditure restraint especially at  the  federal   level.   With   this   expenditure   restraint expected to be slightly loosened in 2002, the decline in the overall deficit should remain relatively moderate in that  year.  As  a  result  of  relatively  modest  deficits  and the   windfall   revenues   from   the   UMTS   licences   (a significant part of which will be used only in 2001 for debt  redemption)  coupled  with  further  receipts  from privatisations, the debt-to-GDP ratio of Germany should fall  below  the  60 %  mark  in  2001  and  reach  a  level below 57 % by the end of the forecasting period		
November/2000	Greece	Entering the euro area with prospects of robust growth	Greece  achieved  remarkable  progress  towards  nominal convergence in recent years. In March 2000, the Greek government  applied  for  euro  zone  participation;  on  a proposal by the Commission, following the conclusions of  the  2000  Commission  Convergence  Report  and  the ECB Report, the Council decided that Greece would be the  12 th Member  of  the  euro  zone  as  from  1  January 2001. The conversion rate of the Greek drachma against the euro will be the central rate of the drachma in ERM II,  decided  in  January  2000,  that  is  340,75  GRD  per euro. GDP  growth  and  its  components. After  a  temporary deceleration  in  1999  as  a  result  of  slower  external demand, real output is estimated to have accelerated in 2000,   rising   above   the   EU   average   for   a   fifth consecutive   year.   All   the   components   of   domestic demand  are  buoyant,  in  particular  private  consumption and investment in equipment, followed by investment in construction; however, exports of goods, while improving as a result of the recovery in world economy, can  hardly  compensate  for  the  fast  rise  in  imports, resulting  in  a  deterioration  of  the  external   balance. Growth  prospects  should  improve  further  in  2001  and 2002: domestic demand will be driven by consumption, boosted  by higher  disposable  income  as  a  result  of  tax reforms and by falling interest rates. The latter will also support  investment,  particularly  in  construction.  Real output growth is forecast to approach 5% to the end of the forecast period. Labour   market .   The   situation   in   the   labour   market deteriorated    in    1999.    Sustained    activity    and    the announced  plans  for  structural  reform  are  expected  to support  an  improvement  in  the  forecast  period.  Real wages   decelerated   further   in   1999,   reflecting   the restrictive  incomes  policy  in  the  public  sector  and  the two-year collective wage agreement in the private sector which provided for nominal wage increases on the basis of expected inflation. The agreement expired at the end of  1999  and  another  was  signed  in  May  2000.  Wage increases in 2000 incorporated the year-end increase in prices  in  excess  of  projected  inflation  for  end-1999, which  was  equal  to  0.7%.  The  new  two-year  wage agreement provides no  compensation  for  inflation  until the  end  of  2001;  this,  associated  with  expected  wage moderation  in  the  public  sector,  will  contribute  to  a moderate  increase  in  unit  labour  costs  in  the  entire forecasting period. Prices .  Favourable  developments  in  unit  labour  costs and in international commodity prices were reflected in the downward trend of consumer price inflation until the third quarter of 1999; since then, the situation has been reversed  under  the  pressure  of  surging  oil  prices.  The national   index   of   consumer   prices   increased   by   an annual  average  of  2.6%  in  1999  down  from  4.8%  in 1998. In September 2000, the index rose by 3.1% (year- on-year). Nonetheless, underlying trends point to stable inflation  prospects:  CPI  inflation  excluding  fresh  fruit and vegetables and fuels remains considerably below the headline rate since October 1999. The gap between the increases   of   prices   of   goods   and   services   is   also narrowing. In  the  remainder  of  the  forecast  period,  a  number  of factors   will   push   price   developments   in   opposite directions.  On  one  hand,  inflation  pressures  are  most likely  to  emerge  from  the  monetary  easing  implied  by the  fall  in  interest  rates  and  from  international  price developments. On the other hand, price stability may be supported   by   fiscal   tightening,   by   the   increase   in competition   in   the   markets   of   goods   and   services following    announced    structural reforms and the liberalisation  of  markets.  In  addition,  wage  inflation  is not  expected  to  emerge,  in  particular  in  view  of  the outcome    of    the    new    two-year    wage    agreement, combined  with  the  acceleration  in  productivity  and  the relatively high rate of unemployment. Public  finances .  The  public  finances  have  posted  an uninterrupted improvement since 1994. In November 1999,  the  Council  abrogated  its  decision  on the  existence  of  an  excessive  deficit  in  Greece.  The general government deficit was reduced to 1.8% of GDP from  1.9%  set  in  the  budget.  The  budget  for  2000, targeted a deficit for the general government of 1.2% of GDP   while   the   1999   update   of   the   convergence programme  projects  a  deficit  of  0.2%  of  GDP  in  2001 and  a  surplus  of  0.2%  of  GDP  in  2002.  As  a  result  of estimated better budget revenues, the general government deficit is estimated at 0.8% of GDP in 2000. The  general  government  deficit  is  forecast  to  fall  to 0.3% of GDP in 2001 and turn into a surplus of 0.3% in 2002. The primary surplus, after reaching 5.8% of GDP in 1999, is expected to remain broadly stable to the end of the forecasting period. Thus, in both 2001 and 2002, the reduction of the general government deficit would be mostly  the  result  of  lower  debt  servicing  costs.  The Greek  government,  in  the  budget  for  2001,  presented early   November,   is   targeting   a   general   government surplus   already   in   2001;   this   projection   assumes somewhat  higher  GDP  growth  and  primary  surpluses compared to Commission forecasts. Debt    ratio .    The    correction    of    fiscal    imbalances, combined with the allocation of privatisation receipts to pay-off public debt resulted in reducing the debt ratio in 1999  for  a  third  consecutive  year.  The  expected  high level   of   primary   surplus   throughout   the   forecasting period is expected to support the downward path of the debt ratio, which is forecast to fall slightly below 100% of GDP at the end of 2001		
November/2000	Spain	Growth remains strong although decelerating	Output. GDP rose by 4.0% in 1999 compared to 4.3% in the previous year. In 2000 economic activity is expected to keep its dynamism posting a growth of 4.1%, but with a  different  GDP  composition  and  a  decelerating  trend during the year. For 2001, output growth is expected to moderate  to  3.5%  with  an  accentuation  of  the  trends previously  followed  by  GDP  components.  Finally,  in 2002 growth is forecast to stabilise at around 3.3%. This growth performance  means  that  GDP  would  have  been rising above 3.0% for six years in a row . In   2000   economic   growth   should   remain   robust, reaching  4.1%  due  to  the  strenght  showed  in  the  first two quarters whereas a gradual moderation is expected in the second half of the year. GDP components would continue behaving in line with the patterns showed since the   third   quarter   of   the   previous   year.   Fisrtly,   a deceleration  in  domestic  demand  is  forecast.  Although private  consumption  should  remain  strong,  its  growth should  moderate  as  the  main  effects  of  the  1999  tax reform fade away, employment continues growing but at slower  pace  according  to  labour  current  indicators  and real disposable income moderates. In addition, investment,  especially investment  in  equipment,  should moderate its dynamism partially because of the expected increase   of   interest   rates   and   the   negative   effects stemming   from   high   oil   prices.   Secondly,   Spanish exports should continue being strong, although slowing down gradually as the international setting, especially in the EU area, is less favouarable. However, since imports would decelerate sharper, in line with domestic demand, that would give rise to a less negative contribution from the external sector. In 2001 GDP growth is set at 3.5% with an accentuation of  the  trends  previously  described  for  2000:  a  more moderate    domestic    demand    and    a    less    negative contribution  from  the  external  sector  to  GDP  growth. Annual   average   growth   of   private   consumption   is expected  to  decelerate  due  to  a  slower  employment creation and to the fact that not only the  effects  of  the income tax reform will have completely disappeared but income tax brackets will not be deflated. This would be coherent with the envisaged stabilisation of saving ratio in  2001.  As  for  investment  in  equipment,  it  would remain moderate given the worsening in the macoroeconomic scenario, while dwellings would show a  decelerating trend  after  having reached  a  peak in  the second  half  of  2000.  Regarding  the  external  sector,  it would register a less negative contribution since imports would continue moderating faster than exports. For 2002, GDP growth is forecast to stabilise at around 3.3% with a profile suggesting an acceleration in the last part of the year (see graph). Labour market. Employment  is  foreseen  to  rise  briskly by 3.1% in 2000 but with a decelerating trend as labour market  indicators  suggest.  In  2001  it  is  expected  to remain   strong   although   moderating   to   2.4%.   This moderation is based mainly on an expected deceleration in   those   activity   branches   more   labour   intensive, especially  construction  and  services,  which  have  been the more dynamic branches in job creation in the recent past. As a result, the still very high unemployment rate should   keep   on   a   clear   decreasing  path   during  the forecasting period. Prices. In  2000,  despite  moderate  wage  growth,  price developments  are  being  worse  than  expected  in  the Spring forecast due to the behaviour of the more volatile items,  energy  prices  and  unprocessed  food.  The  HICP for  2000  is  forecast  at  3.4%  on  average  compared  to 2.2% in the previous year. In 2001 inflation is expected to  decelerate  to  2.9%.  This  would  be  based  on  the assumptions on oil prices in 2001, a better behaviour of unprocessed-food prices, a moderation of some components of service prices (especially telecommunications)  and  the  deceleration  in  domestic demand which should help to ease inflationary pressures in  the  forecasting  period.  However,  the  second-round effects would be visible in the GDP deflator growth rate compared to HICP inflation and in the accceleration of unit labour costs. Finally, in 2002 inflation is forecast to decelerate to 2.2%. External sector. The current account deficit is expected to widen gradually during the forecasting period. This is due mainly to the worsening of the terms of trade which partially  explains  the  growing  trade  deficit.  The  latter could not be offset by the expected surplus in the service balance. Public finances. In 2000, the ongoing fiscal consolidation   is   expected   to   continue   based   on   the strenght   of   revenues   and   the   control   on   current expenditure.    Thus,    general    government    deficit    is forecast at 0.3% of GDP (1.1% in the previous year) in line  with  the  official  target  recently  revised  downward (from 0.4% to 0.3% of GDP). For  next  year  a  surplus  of  0.1%  of  GDP  is  expected, compared  to  the  official  target  of  balance  (one  year earlier than foreseen in the stability programme update). The  achievement  of  this  surplus  would  be  possible thanks to several factors. Firstly, tax revenues, although decelerating  slightly,  would  remain  strong.  Secondly, the  government  has  recently announced  the  increase  in the fee on UMTS companies. Finally, current expenditure is expected to grow moderately, since civil servant   wages   will   be   increased   by   2.0%   and   the outgoing staff (although with some exemptions, such as Justice,  Police  and  Army)  will  only  be  substitued  by 25%  one  year  more.  As  a  result,  public  consumption would  continue   losening  weight   over   GDP.   Interest payments  are  also  expected  to  lose  weight.  The  deficit reduction would be compatible with the continuation of an active labour policy and the increase in public gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GDP. In 2002, and under the assumption of no policy changes, the  general  government  balance  is  forecast  to  reach  a surplus of 0.2% of GDP. Stemming  from  increasing  primary  surpluses  coupled with  healthy  growth  rates  and  the  still  relatively  low interest rates for the Spanish economy, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to continue on a declining path during the  forecasting  period.  As  a  result,  after  reaching  a figure of 61.0% in 2000, the debt ratio is forecast to fall below 60.0% in 2001		
November/2000	France	The current phase of expansion is set to continue,  but  some  pressure  on  wages and prices could gradually emerge	The first half of 2000 . French GDP growth slowed from almost 4% in the second half of 1999 to less than 3% in the  first  six  months  of  2000.  This  deceleration  mainly reflects   the   effect   of   higher   oil   prices   on   the   real economy,  with  a  marked  deceleration  in  households purchasing power  in  the  first  half  of  the  year.  It  might also have been the result, albeit to a lesser degree, of the emergence  of  constraints  on  production  and  on  the labour  market.  Generally  speaking,  the  latest  figures suggest  that  growth  has  peaked  in  the  second  half  of 1999. Prospects. However, growth should not dip significantly in France. Over the three years covered by the forecast, GDP  should  expand  by  an  average  of  3%  a  year.  The French  economy  should  therefore  emerge  from  the  oil crisis without experiencing any marked downturn given that household demand is holding up well, underpinned as  it  is  by  job  creation  and  tax  cuts.  The  very  gradual slowdown  of  GDP  built  into  the  forecast  reflects  the influence   of   several   factors.   In   the   first   place,   the international   environment   is   likely   to   become   less buoyant, and the gains in competitiveness resulting from the  depreciation  of  the  euro  are  expected  to  vanish gradually.  Secondly,  the  impact  of  the  tax  cuts  will diminish.   Finally,   the   emergence   of   constraints   on production could gradually exert a dampening effect on activity. GDP  components .  Private  consumption,  which  is  the mainstay  of  the  current  phase  of  expansion,  should remain  very  firm  throughout  the  forecasting  period. Household  purchasing  power,  which  will  continue  to benefit from the positive employment trend, is expected to  be  bolstered  by  two  main  factors.  On  the  one  hand, wage growth is set to rebound sharply from the second half    of    2000    under    the    impact    of    the    fall    in unemployment   and   an   upturn   in   inflation   in   the preceding quarters. On the other, implementation of the multiannual  tax-cutting  programme  will  push  personal disposable income up by more than one percentage point over  the  period  2000-02,  almost  offsetting  the  loss  in purchasing power caused by the oil crisis. Exports, led by the buoyancy of world demand and the effects of past gains in competitiveness, should continue to increase at a very sustained pace. Since the prospects for  demand  remain  good,  French  firms  will  probably continue to increase their production capacities despite a relative  worsening  of  their  financial  position  and  a gradual increase in the cost of borrowing. Employment,  wages  and  prices. Employment  growth should reach in 2000 its highest level for more than 20 years  (exceeding  3%  for  private-sector  employment). This exceptional performance is linked to the dynamism of  economic  activity  and  the  impact  of  employment policies.  In  particular,  the  introduction  of  the  35-hour week in firms with more than 20 people has given rise to a  significant  shortening  of  working  time  in  the  private sector. With the unemployment rate falling rapidly, the signing    of these working    time agreements has contributed    to    the    pronounced    wage    moderation observed in 2000. Employment growth is expected to remain firm over the forecasting    period.    However,    it    should    gradually decelerate because of a slight slowdown in activity and as  the  effects  of  employment  policies  gradually  fade. The unemployment rate will continue to fall, and should reach  a  level  close  to  8%  by  the  end  of  2002.  This forecast  implies  a  sustained  increase  in  the  size  of  the labour force and thus a return to the labour market of a significant number of currently inactive people. The  labour  market  should  therefore  gradually  become tighter,  probably  triggering  a  rebound  in  wage  growth. Consequently, despite slightly higher productivity gains than in 2000 and the restraining effect of the reductions in   social   security   contributions   accompanying   the introduction  of  the  35-hour  week,  unit  wage  costs  are expected   accelerate   gradually   over   the   forecasting period, to around 2% per annum in 2002. The continuing high  level  of  oil  prices  and  the  increase  in  unit  labour costs  are  set  to  push  inflation  up  slightly  over  the forecasting period. Public  finances. The  consolidation  of  French  public finances, which for a number of years has been built on a strict control of spending and an increase in revenues underpinned   by  the   buoyancy  of   economic   activity, should continue over the forecasting period. Nevertheless,  after  last  year's  sharp  deficit  reduction (from 2.7% of GDP in 1998 to 1.8% in 1999), budgetary consolidation  is  expected  to  slow  somewhat  under  the impact   of   the   tax-cutting   measures   adopted   by   the Government  in  the  form  of  a  multiannual  programme involving  cuts  totalling  1.2%  of  GDP.  These  come  on top of cuts equivalent to 0.9% of GDP implemented in 2000.  In  this  context,  the  overall  tax  burden,  which reached an historical high level in 1999, is scheduled to fall  by  more  than  one  percentage  point  between  1999 and 2002. The   general   government   deficit   -   excluding   UMTS revenues - is forecast to fall by 0.4 percentage point each year,  to  ½%  of  GDP  in  2002.  If  the  impact  of  UMTS revenues is taken into account, the general  government budget will be in balance in 2001. The reduction in the debt to GDP ratio should continue at a sustained rate: it is forecast to fall from 58.9% in 1999 to below 56% in 2002		
November/2000	Ireland	High, but slowing, growth and moderating inflation	Output in 2000 . After a very strong performance in 1999 with  real  GDP  growth  of  9.8%,  the  Irish  economy  is expected to continue its rapid pace of expansion in 2000. Real  GDP  growth  is  forecast  to  attain  10.5%  and  be broadly based across all sectors of the economy. Private consumption  is  expanding  faster  than  in  1999  as  a combined    consequence    of    high    employment    and earnings growth, wealth effects, the current programme of tax cuts and negative real interest rates. Investment in equipment continues to rise rapidly as does output in the construction   sector   in   response   to   strong   housing demand  and  public  expenditure  on  infrastructure  under the  National  Development  Plan.  Finally,  net  exports benefit  both  from  a  gain  in  competitiveness  (as  the weakness of the euro stimulates exports to non-euro area countries,  especially  to  the  UK  and  the  US)  and  rapid growth in Ireland's markets. The  outlook  for  growth .  In  an  economy  that  has  been growing at 6.6% on average in the nineties and at 9.3% over  the  1995-1999  period,  it  is  hard  to  gauge  the potential  rate  of  output  growth.  The  forecast  assumes that  double-digit  output  growth  as  projected  for  2000 cannot  continue  to  be  maintained  with  a  tight  labour market (see below). While the economy is still expected to   grow   strongly,   the   forecast   assumes   a   gentle slowdown  to  8.2%  in  2001  and  7.1%  in  2002.  On  the domestic    demand    side,    the    slowdown    in    private consumption   growth   is   due   to   slower   employment growth and a saving ratio that is assumed to rise in 2002, while   the   moderate   deceleration   in   the   growth   of investment  in  equipment  reflects  some  expected  easing in  FDI  inflows.  Export  growth  is  set  to  decline  as  the weakness  of  the  euro  is  halted  and  rising  unit  labour costs start eroding competitiveness. External  sector .  For  the  first  time  in  a  decade,  the current  account  is  expected  to  post  a  deficit  in  2000, which  will  persist  over  the  rest  of  the  forecast  period. Apart  from  the  effect  of  higher  oil  prices  on  the  trade balance in 2000, this reflects the fact that, in contrast to previous years, the growing trade surplus will no longer be   strong   enough   to   offset   the   steadily   increasing deficits on both the services balance and the balance of primary incomes. Employment and labour supply .Employmentgrowthin 2000 is forecast to be around 5%. However, increasing evidence of general labour shortages suggests that such growth rates are untenable except in the very short run. Unemployment is forecast to continue its declining trend to attain 4.2% in 2000, down from a peak of 15.6% in 1993,  and  to  fall  even  further  to  3.3%  by  2002.  The contribution of other sources of labour supply, however, is   likely   to   decline.   More   specifically,   the   natural demographic increase will come down over the forecast period, there are obviously limits to rises in participation rates  (in  spite  of  stimulating  tax  reforms)  and  inward migration will inevitably be discouraged by factors such as  rising  accommodation  costs.  The  forecast  therefore assumes  that  employment  growth  will  slow  down  to 2.6%  in  2002.  Productivity  growth  of  5.2%  in  2000  is projected to decline somewhat over  the  forecast  period to a still very high rate of 4.4% in 2002. Wage  developments .  Available  data  for  2000  suggest that there could be substantial wage drift over and above the  5.5%  nominal  wage  increase  provided  in  the  latest national  agreement.  This  drift  results  from  workers' improved  bargaining  position  in  a  tight  labour  market and  from  their  demands  for  compensation  for  higher- than-expected  inflation.  Growth  in  compensation  per employee  is  therefore  projected  to  be  7.8%  in  2000, rising further to 8.3% in 2002. This acceleration follows from  the  assessment  that,  in  a  tight  labour  market, workers  will  gradually  be  able  to  stem  the  declining trend   of   the   wage   share,   with   total   compensation growing  at  around  the  same  rate  as  nominal  GDP  in 2002. The gradual loss in competitiveness resulting from the projected path for wages is compatible with the 'soft landing'  scenario  described  above.  In  particular,  it  is assumed that the development of a damaging wage-price spiral can be avoided. Inflationary pressures . CPI inflation in 2000 is projected to  be  5.5%,  compared  to  just  1.6%  in  1999.  While  a significant part of the present rise in CPI inflation is due to one-off factors such as the increases in tobacco duties in  the  December  1999  Budget,  in  oil  prices  and  the weakness  of  the  euro,  domestically-generated  inflation has  become  increasingly  important,  with  the  average inflation  rate  in  services  and  related  expenditure  over the   first   nine   months   of   2000   standing   at   6.2%. However,  as  one-off  factors  fall  out,  CPI  inflation  is forecast to fall back to 3.8% in 2001 and 3.2% in 2002. In the same terms, HICP inflation will be 3.7% and 3.1% respectively. Underlying this benign outlook is also the expectation that competition in retail  markets  will  help to  limit  inflationary  pressures.  Still,  the  rapid  pace  of house price increases - observed in the past and unlikely to  slow  down  any  time  soon  -  and  generous  rises  in compensation per employee are expected to continue to create inflationary pressures over the forecast period. Public  finances .  The  public  finances  are  in  excellent shape. Despite a programme of tax cuts in the December 1999 Budget, tax revenues are buoyant, having grown at 15.4% over the first three quarters of 2000. The forecast for  the  general  government  surplus  in  2000  has  been revised upwards to 4.2% of GDP, up from 1.7% in the Spring 2000  forecast,  but  about  2  percentage  points  of this  revision  is  due  to  technical  factors  of  accounting connected with pensions pre-funding. The surplus ratio will  increase  slightly  in  2001  and  2002.  The  debt  to GDP  ratio  is  expected  to  fall  to  around  26%  in  2002 mainly  as  a  result  of  high  nominal  GDP  growth  in association with these high surpluses.		
November/2000	Italy	The  growth  gap  with  the  euro  area average  is  narrowing  despite  the  mild slowdown ahead	Growth. The  economic  recovery,  which  set  in  in  the second  half  of  1999,  strengthened  at  the  beginning  of 2000.  After  a  strong  kick-off  in  the  first  quarter,  GDP growth has slightly flattened thereafter. It is expected to accelerate  again  in  the  last  two  quarters,  taking  the annual growth rate close to 2.9%. This is less  than  the euro-area average, but more than twice last year’s rate of growth and the gap with the euro-area is narrowing. The acceleration in GDP growth is mainly driven by net exports.  A  strong  expansion  of  world  trade  combined with  the  depreciation  of  the  euro  has  led  to  a  sharp increase   in   external   demand   for   Italian   goods   and services.  In  2000  net  exports  will  add  0.5  percentage points to real GDP growth. Moreover, the strong export performance   markedly   slowed   down   the   decline   in Italy’s  world  export  share  and  will  lead  to  a  gain  in market share next year. However, the gain is limited to extra-EU trade and echoes the expansion of the market share of the Euro area as a whole. On   the   domestic   side,   the   dynamics   are   mainly supported  by  investment  growth.  Very  high  capacity utilisation,   relatively   low   real   interest   rates,   fiscal incentives  and  a  catching-up  process  in  IT  equipment offer a favourable framework for a sustained expansion in  gross  fixed  capital  formation.  Private  consumption expenditure, the problem child of domestic demand over the last several years, is also expected to grow stronger this year helped by robust employment creation as well as by the tax cuts which are to take place at the end of this year. While  the  pace  of  economic  expansion  is  projected  to slow  only  slightly  in  2001,  the  composition  of  the driving  forces  will  change.  The  contribution  of  net exports   will   weaken   as   a   result   of   the   assumed deceleration of world trade. At the same time domestic demand,  notably  private  consumption  expenditure,  is expected  to  advance  thanks  to  continuing  employment creation and the decrease in the tax pressure. Investment should remain strong, weakening only slightly compared to 2000. The  economic  growth  forecast  could  have  been  higher without  the  oil  price  rally,  which  is  estimated  to  cost around  0.2  percentage  points  of  growth  this  year  and some  further  0.4  percentage  points  in  2001.  However, sustained employment creation, the fiscal measures and some spillover effects from the French and German tax reform help smooth the path of economic expansion. Prices    and    Wages. Consumer    price    inflation    as measured by the HICP index is expected to rise by 2.6% in  2000.  The  increase  essentially  mirrors  the  surge  in energy prices amplified by the weak euro. Until now the core rate, HICP inflation excluding food and energy, has shown   no   particular   signs   of   acceleration,   partially thanks to a favourable productivity growth in manufacturing   and   moderate   wage   increases.   The inflationary  pressure  will  gradually  weaken  in  the  two years following 2000. One crucial assumption underlying  this   forecast   is   that   there   are   no   major second-round  effects  through  wage  settlements.  First, because  the  tax  cuts  contained  in  the  fiscal  package increase   the   purchasing   power   of   after-tax   wages. Second, the agreement between social partners of 1993 states that imported inflation should not be considered in wage  negotiations.  Finally,  the  two  major  trade  unions representing  metal  workers,  whose  contract  is  expiring at the end of this year, have revealed their wage claims, which are in line with continuing wage moderation. Employment and unemployment . The labour market has performed  remarkably  well  since  the  beginning  of  the current recovery. In the twelve months up to July 2000, total  employment  increased  by  over  400  000  units  and the unemployment rate declined to 10.5%. Most jobs are created   in   services.   The   strong   increase   in   total employment    is    in    sharp    contrast    with    previous recoveries,   when   the   link   between   growth   and   job creation  was  much  weaker.  The  higher  employment elasticity  of  growth  primarily  reflects  improved  labour market flexibility through the increasing use of part-time and  temporary  contracts.  Those  contracts  account  for around two thirds of the total employment increase over the  twelve  months  up  to  July  2000.   Higher   labour flexibility should  continue  to  exert  a  positive  effect  on job creation in 2001 and 2002, although less so than this year,  as  the  immediate   catching-up   response   to   the introduction of more flexible contracts is phased out. Public finances . The general government deficit-to-GDP ratio  is  estimated  at  0.1%  of  GDP  this  year,  under  the assumption that the proceeds from the allocation of the UMTS licences ( € 13.8 billion) are recorded in 2000, in accordance  with  the  decision  of  Eurostat.  Without  the proceeds  of  the  UMTS  licences,  the  deficit  ratio  is estimated  to  be  1.3%  of  GDP,  in  line  with  official projections. The forecast takes into account higher trend tax  receipts  than  expected  in  the  Spring,  and  fiscal measures  (mainly  tax  cuts)  of  around  0.6%  of  GDP, which  in  part  pertain  to  the  draft  budget  for  the  year 2001 and which will take effect in the last two months of 2000. Some of these measures are structural (notably the broadening  of  the  personal  income  tax  band  with  the lowest tax rate), others are temporary (the  reduction  in the  excise  duty  on  fuels  and  the  reductions  in  the payment  on  account  of  corporate  income  taxes  and  of the  regional  tax  on  production  activities).  Expenditure net  of  interest  payments  assumes  strong  dynamism  in intermediate  consumption.  In  2000  the  primary  surplus (net of the proceeds from the auction of UMTS licences) is  expected  to  improve  to  5.2%  of  GDP  and  interest payments  to  continue  to  decline  to  6.4%  of  GDP.  For 2001,  a  cautious  estimate  of  receipts  from  the  capital gains   tax   and   from   the   sale   of   real   estate,   and   a preliminary evaluation  of  the  measures  in  the  financial law  submitted  to  parliament,  lead  to  a  projection  of  a deficit   of   around   1.1%   of   GDP.   The   planned   tax reductions  are  expected  to  be  fully  implemented,  but some  of  the  expenditure-curbing  measures  may  not  be entirely  effective.  For  2002  the  scenario,  which  takes into   account   further   tax   reductions   and   expenditure savings as set out in next year's financial law, points to a further small reduction of the deficit to 1.0% of GDP in the absence of corrective measures. The  government  debt  ratio  is  expected  to  decline  to 110.7% of GDP in 2000. This outcome also reflects the assumption that 90% of the minimum required bid of the UMTS auction is used to reduce the debt before the end of  the  year.  The  debt  ratio  is  expected  to  continue  to decline  over  the  forecast  period,  also  thanks  to  the planned privatisations.		
November/2000	Luxembourg	Record  growth  for  the  last  years  of the millennium	Growth. The   Luxembourg   economy   is   performing extremely well at the moment, even taking into account the fact that this country is generally recording very high growth rates. Growth has been especially strong in 1999, with the latest estimates around 7.5% in volume, which would  represent  the  second  highest  growth  rate  of  the decade.   Private   consumption   grew   by   4.1%, a significant acceleration with respect to 1998. Government    consumption    recorded    a    very    strong increase    (about    13%    in    volume)    related    to    the introduction    of    the    dependency   insurance    at    the beginning  of  the  year.  Investment  growth   has   been especially dramatic (more than 25% and even more than 50% for investment in equipment), among others due to the purchase of several large aircrafts by a Luxembourg airline  and  to  the  strong  increase  in  public  investment. Finally, if exports of goods suffered in the 1 st semester from  the  slowdown  in  international  trade,  exports  of services  have  proved  remarkably  dynamic,  rising  by about 15% in volume. 2000  should  be  as  good  a  vintage  as  1999  and  maybe even  better.  Government  consumption  and  GFCF  will probably not repeat last year’s exceptional growth rates, even if government investment will   presumably rise by about 15% in value (which means around 11% or 12% in   volume)   but   private   consumption   should   remain dynamic  while  exports  of  goods  should  fully  benefit from  the  strong  growth  in  world  trade.  Since  goods imports will presumably slow somewhat for their strong growth   last   year   was   for   a   large   part   due   to   the exceptional   increase   in   equipment   investment,   the contribution of foreign trade to GDP growth, which had been significantly negative in 1999, should turn widely positive in 2000. Growth might slow slightly down in 2001 and 2002 but should  remain  strong,  presumably  above  5%  :  private consumption will benefit from the large tax cuts recently decided by the Luxembourg government ( ex ante about 1.2% of GDP in 2001 and 1.6% in 2002), which should raise households disposable income by about 2.4% and 3.6%  respectively.  Government  consumption  will  keep growing  at  a  quite  rapid  pace  while  investment  should increase    at    rates    closer    to    its    long-term    trend. Government   investment   should   prove   very   dynamic anyway with the 2001 budget planning a 25.7% increase in  value  in  investment  by  central  government.  Exports should  slow  slightly  down  from  the  high  growth  rate forecast for this year. On the whole the contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth should increase while the   contribution   of   external   trade   should   decrease somewhat over the forecasting period. Employment  and  unemployment .   Strong  growth  in  the economy in recent years resulted in a rapid increase in employment, which grew by 4.4% in 1998 and 5.0% in 1999.  This  evolution  probably  strengthened  this  year since the number of wage-earners rose by 5.9% over the first   eight   months   and   total   employment   by   5.6%. Consequently,  the  decline  in  unemployment  continued and even accelerated in the  last  months.  However,  like in  recent  years,  the  increase  in  employment  mostly benefited  to  frontier  workers,  whose  number  rose  by 12.8%  in  1999  and  should  increase  by  even  more  this year   :   they   represent   now   about   30%   of   domestic employment.  Taking  into  account  the  strong  growth  in the economy expected for the whole forecasting period, employment growth should not slow significantly down. Since unemployment is already at a very low level, the share  of  frontier  workers  in  total  employment  should keep  rising  as  well  probably  as  the  activity  rate  of residents. Wages  and  prices. In  such  a  context  of  strong  activity and employment growth, wage increases have significantly   accelerated   in   recent   months   :   while compensations per head had risen by 3.1% in 1999, they could  increase  by  about  5%  this  year  as  a  result  of  an indexation  threshold  and  of  a  wage  agreement  in  the government sector that both took place in July. The  increase  in  consumer  prices  has  accelerated  even stronger,  with  the  harmonised  consumer  price  index rising by 3.6% over the first 9 months of this year, while it had increased by only 1.0% over the whole year 1999. However, even if this spectacular acceleration fort a part reflects an increase in underlying inflation, it is also due for  a  large  part  to  the  very  high  share  of  petroleum products  in  the  Luxembourg  price  index  :  since  the  1 st January  2000,  the  harmonised  index  also  takes  into account  expenditure  by  non-residents  on  the  Grand- Duchy’s territory and in particular their huge purchases of  petrol,  alcohol  and  tobacco  due  to  the  low  level  of excise   duties   (about   75%   of   motor-fuel   sold   in Luxembourg  are  bought  by  non-residents).  This  is  the reason   why   the   Luxembourg   statistical   office   now computes  a  national  consumer  price  index  excluding purchases by non-residents, which is at present used for wage   indexation   and   whose   rise   has   being   slower (+3.0% over the first nine months of this year). The    rise    in    consumer prices should decelerate significantly   in   2001   and   more   markedly   in   2002, provided  the  assumption  of  a  decrease  in  oil  prices  on which the forecast is based materialises. Because of the larger share of petroleum products the harmonised index should slow more than the national index. If this slowing down  in  inflation  occurs,  some  deceleration  in  wage increases to around 4% in 2001 and 2002 may probably be expected. Public  finances. Strong  growth  recorded  in  1999  and 2000 also resulted in a rapid increase in tax and Social Security  revenues,  especially  in  indirect  taxes,  which have been rising by more than 10% annually over recent years. Despite  a  rather  fast  growth  in  expenditure, especially  in  government  consumption  and  investment, the general government surplus increased from 3.8% of GDP in 1998 to 4.4% in 1999. It should keep rising this year and could get close to 5% of GDP. Large tax cuts already   planned   for   2001   and   2002   as   well   as   a reduction in company taxes announced for 2002 should result in a decrease in the government surplus, especially as  the  increase  in  expenditure  should  remain  rather strong. However, the Grand-Duchy’s finance should stay widely  in  surplus  and  the  general  government  gross debt,  already  the  lowest  (and  by  far)  in  the  whole European  Union  (6%  of  GDP  in  1999)  should  decline slightly  in   percentage   of   GDP   over   the   forecasting period.		
November/2000	Netherlands	5  consecutive  years  of  growth  at 3% or more	Growth .  The  Netherlands  emerged  unscathed  from  the cyclical slowdown which followed the crisis in the Far East,  recording  GDP  growth  of  3.9%  in  1999,  only slightly  down  on  1998  (4.1%).  GDP  growth  slowed significantly between  mid-1998  and  mid-1999  but  took off again in the second half of 1999, a development that was confirmed in the first half of 2000 (up 4.4% year- on-year). Even more than in the previous years, growth in 1999 was driven by private consumption, which rose by   4.4%,   the   same   rate   as   in   1998,   but   also   by investment,  which  increased  by  6.5%  against  4.1%  in 1998  unaffected  by  the  temporary  fall  in  producer’s confidence at the end of 1998. In contrast, export growth slowed  sharply  (5.6%  against  7.4%  in  1998),  albeit  by much  less  than  had  been  feared,  and  picked  up  again briskly in the fourth quarter of 1999. GDP should accelerate further this year to around 4.3%. Domestic    demand    will    continue    to    be    buoyant, particularly    private consumption, which will be underpinned by    strong    employment growth, the relatively   rapid   rise   in   wages   and   probable   wealth effects resulting from the sharp increase in asset prices over  recent  years.  In  addition  to  these  factors,  which have  been  in  evidence  for  several  years  now,  the  tax reform  due  to  enter  into  force  on  1 January  2001  is likely   to   impact   on   the   economy:   households   in particular  will  probably  anticipate  the  increase  in  the standard VAT  rate from 17.5% to 19% by stepping up purchases of durable goods in the last few months of the year. Total investment should pick up slightly in relation to 1999, public investment proving particularly buoyant. Lastly,   exports   will   benefit   from   strong   growth   in international  trade  and  from  the  depreciation  of  the Euro,  which  will  compensate  for  wage   costs   rising significantly faster than in neighbouring countries. GDP  growth  can  be  expected  to  slow  somewhat  next year, to around 4%, and in 2002, to around 3½%. Private consumption will probably remain particularly dynamic, buoyed   up   by   the   very   solid   increase   in   personal disposable income (up by about  10%  in  nominal  terms and  6%  in  real  terms)  that  will  be  amplified  by  the reduction in income taxes and social security contributions paid by households, planned as part of the 2001  tax  reform.  In  contrast,  total  investment  should ease slightly in both 2001 and 2002, essentially because construction   output   is   not   expected   to   repeat   high growth  rate  registered  this  year.  Exports  should  also gradually feel the effects of the moderate  slowdown  in international trade forecast for 2000 and 2001 and of the relative deterioration of the Dutch economy's competitiveness in recent years. Employment  and  unemployment. The  strong  growth  in the   Dutch   economy   since   1994   is   reflected   in   a significant  rise  in  employment  (about  3%  a  year  in recent  years).  This  trend  continued  in  1999,  with  total employment up by 2.8% (2.9% in full-time equivalent). As  a  result,  unemployment  continued  to  fall  rapidly, with the harmonised Eurostat rate declining from 4.0% in  1998  on  an  annual  average  basis  to  3.3%  in  1999. Growth in employment is set to remain buoyant over the entire forecasting period, but will probably diminish as a result   of   mounting   labour   shortages   (the   stock   of unfilled  vacancies  has  been  higher  than  the  number  of registered unemployed since the summer). Unemployment  has  continued  its  downward  trend  this year,  with  the  Eurostat  rate  dipping  to  2.5%  in  July, which  should  also  be  the  annual  average  for  2000.  In 2001  and  2002  unemployment  should  continue  to  fall, albeit   at   a   slower   pace   as   it   will   doubtless   be approaching incompressible levels. Accordingly, higher employment  is  expected  to  come  essentially  from  a higher activity rate, which despite climbing significantly in  recent  years,  is  still  relatively  low  in  international terms. Prices   and   wages .   The   strong   growth   in   activity recorded    since    1994    and    the    resulting    fall in unemployment   have   been   reflected   in   a   substantial increase  in  wage  growth  since  1997,  which  brought fifteen years of exemplary wage moderation to an end at the  very  time  when  such  restraint  was  becoming  the norm   in   neighbouring   countries.   The   result   was   a worsening of the external competitiveness of the Dutch economy  following  the  very  significant  gains  in  the 1980s and for most of the 1990s. However, the adverse trend  in  recent  years  has  been  offset  to  date  by  the depreciation of the Euro. In the light of growing labour market tensions, wage increases are not expected to slow significantly in the forecasting period, even though some restraint  in  wage  claims  can  perhaps  be  anticipated  in response to the substantial increase in disposable income resulting from the 2001 tax reform. Consumer price inflation has remained rather moderate in  recent  years  but  has  still  become  higher  than  in neighbouring countries, where it fell to an all-time low. CPI inflation stood at 2.0% in 1998 and 2.2% in 1999, compared  with  1.8%  and  2.0%  respectively  for  the HICP.  All  things  considered,  these  are  rather  moderate figures  following  several  years  of  rapid  growth  and  a sharp   fall   in   unemployment.   However,   inflation   is picking  up  significantly  this  year  as  a  result  of  rising import   prices   in   general   and   rising   oil   prices   in particular. An even sharper increase is forecast for next year under the additional impact of higher indirect taxes. With  sustained  growth  in  the  economy  and  mounting tensions on the labour market, both of which have been built  into  the  forecast,  inflation  should  remain  fairly high in 2002, although it will probably be lower than in 2001 as the effects of the rise in indirect taxes gradually fade away. Public finances . On the basis of strong growth and  the higher tax revenues and lower social security expenditure which it engendered, the deficit of 0.6% of GDP initially forecast for 1999 was transformed into  a surplus  of  1%,  the  first  since  1973,  while  the  ratio  of public debt to GDP fell to 62.9%. A general government surplus of about 1¾% of GDP should be posted in 2000, boosted  by  revenue  from  the  sale  of  UMTS  licences equivalent  to  0.7%  of  GDP,  while  the  public  debt  is expected   to   fall   below   the   60%   threshold.   The wide-ranging  tax  reform  due  to  enter  into  force  on 1 January  2001  will  lead  to  a  significant  decrease  in income tax and social security contributions that will be only  partly  offset  by  the  increase  in  indirect  taxes. Accordingly, the general government surplus should fall to  about  ½%  of  GDP  before  rising  sharply  in  2002, assuming  policy  remains  unchanged.  The  public  debt ratio will continue on its downward path and should fall below 50% of GDP in 2002		
November/2000	Austria	Favourable growth prospects despite restrictive fiscal stance	Growth .  The  profile  of  growth  in  Austria  over  the forecasting period is to a significant extent influenced by budgetary policy, apart from factors common to all EU Member  States.  In  the  year  2000  a  major  income  tax relief provides fiscal stimulus, while in  2001  and  2002 budgetary  consolidation  is  expected  to  exert  a  drag  on growth.  Hence,  in  2000  output  growth  in  Austria  is expected to accelerate considerably to 3.5% after 2.8% in 1999. With the exception of public consumption, all demand components are contributing to this expansion. In 2001, growth is projected to decelerate  substantially owing  to  a  noticeable  slowdown  in  domestic  demand and somewhat slower external demand growth. Restrictive fiscal policy is expected not only to lead to falling    public    consumption    but    will    also    affect enterprises   and   private   households   through   various mainly  tax  related  measures.  In  addition,  exports  are likely to decelerate throughout the forecasting period in step  with  the  economic  development  of  Austria’s  main trading  partners.  As  a  result,  annual  growth  in  2001 should  reduce  speed  to  some  2.9%.  In  2002,  domestic demand   is   expected   to   recover   somewhat,   mostly offsetting  the  further  projected  slowdown  in  exports. Hence,  GDP  growth  is  forecast  to  remain  more  or  less steady. Demand  components .  Private  consumption  is  expected to  peak  in  the  current  year.  Households’  disposable income surged thanks to a reduction in income taxes and increases   in   child   benefits,   combined   with   higher employment  and  declining unemployment.  By contrast, new    excise    duties,    introduced    in    June    2000    in conjunction with the high oil prices are likely to lead to some  deceleration  in  the  second  half  year.  In  2001, budgetary  consolidation  measures  will  act  to  further dampen   households’   purchasing   power.   Supply   side conditions in 2001 are expected to deteriorate after the projected resurgence of investment in equipment in the current year. Investment allowances for enterprises will be   abolished   by   15   December   2000.   Consequently, enterprises are expected to bring forward some of their investments   with   negative   repercussions   into   2001. Fiscal restraint and the resulting slack in public demand are    expected    to    hamper    construction    investment particularly in 2001 but also in 2002 . Net exports should contribute to GDP growth in both 2001 and 2002 due to a slowdown in import growth. Prices. In 1999, Austria registered a record low in post- war   inflation.   Yet,   in   view   of   the   oil   price   hike, increases  in  excise  duties  introduced  in  June  2000  and the closing output gap consumer prices are estimated to rise   in   2000,   remaining,   however,   rather   moderate among euro zone countries. In 2001 and 2002  they are projected  to  increase  at  a  decelerating  pace,  given  the assumed halt and later decline in oil prices. In addition and contrary to the tax increases introduced in 2000, the budgetary  consolidation  in  2001  and  2002  should  be virtually inflation-neutral. Wages .  Given  the  higher  than  anticipated  inflation  rate and  low  nominal  wage  increases  in  the  current  year, wages in 2001 are expected to recuperate for this income loss in real terms. Nevertheless, a reasonable outcome of the  currently  ongoing  wage  negotiations  is  projected. The  wage  agreements  in  some  of  the  industrial  sectors concluded so far seem to support this assessment. Public administration  agreed  on  a  particularly  moderate  pay rise  in  both  2001  and  2002.  Still,  with  higher  wage increases  in  2001  labour  costs  are  projected  to  rise, decreasing again in 2002, when no compensation effects are expected. As a result, Austria’s improvement in cost- competitiveness vis-à-vis its trading partners is likely to come only temporarily to a halt. Labour market . In line with the outlook for production, employment growth is expected to continue in 2000 and decelerate  afterwards.  The  forecast  assumes  that  the expansion   in   employment   will   to   some   extent   be absorbed    by    rising    labour    supply,    partly    as    a consequence of changes in the social security legislation.    Consequently , employment gains will translate only partially into a decline in the unemployment   rate.   Nevertheless,   unemployment   is expected to fall noticeably not least due to a tightening of eligibility criteria. Due to compulsory participation in training  measures  persons  out  of  work  not  actively searching for a new job will drop out of unemployment statistics. Current  account .  In  the  year  1999,  the  current  account deficit widened significantly to 2.6% of GDP owing to a sharp increase in the net outflow of primary income. In the current year the noticeable drop in tourism exports, which have improved substantially in 1999, is expected to  result  in  a  lower  services  surplus . Together  with  a widening trade deficit – owing to the oil price hike and buoyant domestic demand - the current account deficit is expected  to  deteriorate  further  in  the  year  2000  but  to improve somewhat thereafter. In 2001, in particular, the slowdown in domestic demand should result in a lower trade deficit. Public  finances .  In  the  year  2000  an  expansive  and front-loaded   income   tax   reform  took   effect,   costing some 1.1% of GDP, of which some 0.9% of GDP weigh on  the  current  year . The  budgetary  outcome  in  2000 depends heavily on the revenue from the mobile phone licence    sale    (UMTS).    This    forecast    incorporates projected revenues of € 727 million or 0.36% of GDP, the  minimum  amount  stipulated  by  the  government. While   being  some   0.2   percentage   points   above   the income   originally   budgeted,   this   seems   a   cautious estimate. As a consequence, net lending in the year 2000 is expected to drop to 1.3% of GDP from 2.1% in 1999. According  to  the  draft  budget  for  the  years  2001  and 2002, the government intends to take a restrictive fiscal stance. The budget will be adopted in December, hence some  of  the  corresponding  statutory  measures  are  still being  prepared  but  most  likely  to  be  passed.  As  a consequence, this forecast incorporates expenditure cuts and  additional  revenue  as  outlined  in  the  draft  budget (except the intended reduction in non-wage labour costs, since no decision has been taken so far). The measures at the federal level incorporated in this forecast amount to € 4.8 billion or 2.3% of GDP cumulatively from 2000 to   2002.   More   than   two   thirds   are   revenue   side measures. Noteworthy on the expenditure side is a major pension reform effective since 1 October 2000 resulting in  gradually  increasing  budgetary  savings  as  of  next year.  In  addition,  restructuring  public  administration should  reduce  budgetary  expenses.  On  this  basis,  the general government deficit is expected to drop in 2001 to 0.8% of GDP, and to decrease further to 0.5% of GDP in 2002		
November/2000	Portugal	Growth slowdown to a more sustainable pace	2000 outcome . GDP growth is estimated to rise by about 3 % in 2000, the same growth rate as registered in 1999. The intra-annual profile of exports will favour growth in the second half of the year. The composition of growth has  changed  markedly  in  2000,  with  the  slowdown  in domestic demand being roughly offset by an acceleration  of  export  growth.  Private  consumption  is estimated to have decelerated from 5 % in 1999 to some 3 %  in  2000,  with  a  particular  strong  slowdown  in  the demand for durables. Investment growth is  expected  to have increased from 5¼ % in 1999 to 6 % in 2000. The behaviour of investment differed between its construction  and  equipment  components.  In  particular, activity  in  construction  is  likely  to  have  weakened, reflecting   a   levelling   off   in   the   residential   sector, following    several    years    of    rapid    growth,    while investment in equipment is estimated to have accelerated,  as  indicated  also  by  the  rapid  growth  in imports  of  equipment.  Export  growth,  which  started  to pick up in the fourth quarter of 1999, should continue its rise  in  2000,  reflecting  mainly  the  strengthening  of foreign  demand.  On  an  annual  basis,  growth  of  goods exports is likely to increase by 3 % in 1999 and by about 8½ % in 2000. Growth  outlook. GDP  is  expected  to  grow  by  some 2¾ % in both 2001 and 2002, as a result of the expected further  weakening  of  domestic  demand,  which  will  be only  partially  compensated  by  stronger  export  growth. Domestic demand is expected to slow down to an annual growth rate of around 3 %, after an average growth rate of over 5 % in the period 1996-00. Private consumption should remain on its downward trend, attaining a rate of about 2½ %, as the households' saving ratio is assumed to  stabilise  at  a  historically  low  level.  A  number  of factors   point   to   a   further   deceleration   in   consumer expenditure,   namely   the   rise   in   interest   rates,   the deterioration  in  consumer  confidence  registered  since the  beginning  of  2000,  some  saturation  in  demand, following  the  rapid  expansion  in  the  consumption  of durables in recent years, and the expected slowdown in the  pace  of  employment  creation  as  the  economy  is operating  near  full  employment.  Moreover,  households are  also  likely  to  curb  the  pace  of  total  expenditure growth  in  order  to  contain  a  further  rise  in  their  debt ratios, which  will  have  attained  historically high  levels at the end of 2000. Total    investment growth    should    decelerate    only marginally from about 6 % in 2000 to between 5½ and 5¾ %  in  the  period  2001-02,  although  masking  some differences    within    the    sector.    More    specifically, investment  in  equipment  is  likely  to  remain  robust  at around  6½ %  on  the  back  of  brightening  prospects  for export  demand  coupled  with  a  relatively  high  level  of capacity utilisation. Also public investment is projected to pick-up in the period 2001-02, in line with the recent evolution  in  new adjudications  and  the  implementation of a new Community Support Framework. By contrast, investment in construction is forecast to decelerate. This is based on a "soft landing" scenario for the residential construction   sector   following   its   exceptionally   fast expansion  during  the  period  1996-99,  an  assumption which   appears   corroborated   by   the   deceleration   in mortgage   credit   registered   since   mid-1999   and   the reduction in the number of building permits. Export market growth for goods is estimated to average some  8½ %,  after  10¾ %  in  2000,  making  for  strong export  growth  despite  some  further  losses  in  market shares due to the evolution of labour costs. As imports are   projected   to   decelerate   in   step   with   domestic demand,  the  growth  contribution  of  net  exports  will improve. However, this will not be sufficient to stop the deterioration in the current balance underway for some years, which in the forecast period is due mainly to the worsening in the terms of trade. Current   account. The   current   and   capital   accounts deficit  is  estimated  to  attain  approximately  9¼ %  of GDP in 2000 (6 % in 1999). The external imbalance is not projected to narrow in the period 2001-02, attaining about  9½ %  of  GDP  in  2002.  The  worsening  of  the foreign imbalance is due mainly to a deterioration in the terms of trade amounting to an accumulated 4 % in the period  2000-01,  a  higher  trade  deficit  in  volume  terms and  a  deterioration  in  the  balance  of  primary  income. The  counterpart  of  this  rising  disequilibrium is  a  rapid accumulation of net external liabilities by the household and the financial sectors. Prices. Consumer  price  inflation  has  accelerated  since March   2000,   following   the   rise   in   fuel   prices,   the weakening   of   the   euro   and   higher   prices   of   food products.  On  average,  the  HICP  is  forecast  to  increase by  2.7 %  in  2000,  up  from  2.2 %  in  1999.  Inflation  is likely  to  remain  above  2½ %  in  2001  due  basically  to carry-over effects and adjustments in user energy prices. Labour    market. Employment    growth    in    2000    is estimated  at  1½ %.  It  is  expected  to  slow  down  in  the forecast   period   to   about   ¾ %,   in   line   with   the development of output growth. The unemployment rate is projected to remain below 4½ % in the period 2001- 02.  In  a  situation  of  near  full  employment  companies will  find  it  progressively  difficult  to  recruit  qualified personnel. Continued tightness of the labour market will put pressure on wages, which are projected to continue to rise by about 5 % per year. Government  finances. In  2000,  windfall  revenues  of € 0.4 billion (about 0.4 % of GDP) due to the sale of 4 UMTS   licenses   were   instrumental   in   attaining   the government's deficit target of 1.5 % of GDP. In fact, the outcome   of   budgetary   execution   was   characterised basically  by  lower  (than  budgeted)  revenue  and  higher current  expenditure.  Forecasts  for  the  period  2001-02 include the measures announced in the budget presented to  Parliament  on  the  16 th of  October.  On  a  public accounts  basis,  the  budget  projects inter  alia ariseof 9.3 %   in   current   revenue   (over   the   estimation   of budgetary execution for 2000), an  increase  of  7.8 %  in current expenditure and of 14.7% in capital expenditure. This would translate, on a national accounts basis, into a decline  in  the  general  government  deficit  to  1.1 %  of GDP,  thereby complying with  the  Stability  Programme objectives.  However,  given  that  in  the  Commission's Autumn  forecasts  nominal  GDP  growth  is  about  1½ percentage  points  below  that  of  the  macroeconomic scenario   underlying   the   budget,   the   deficit   ratio   is projected to exceed by about ¼ of a percentage point the official target of 1.1 % of GDP.		
November/2000	Finland	Growth to moderate as capacity limits begin to bind	The economy in 2000. The rate of expansion in activity probably peaked in the first half of 2000, when year-on- year growth was around 5%. The strength of activity in the  first  half  owed  much  to  unusually  high  consumer spending,   particularly   on   cars   and   other   consumer durables.   This   was   buoyed   by   the   high   level   of confidence,  real  income  gains  (including  from  stock options  and  profit-sharing  schemes)  and  wealth  effects from rising asset prices. Higher private consumption in turn  prompted  a  strong  rise  in  imports  of  goods.  By contrast   the   strong   momentum   of   export   growth weakened  somewhat,  and  in  addition  fixed  investment expenditure   was   surprisingly   low,   and    equipment investment  is  recorded  as  having  fallen  compared  with the second half of 1999, as did government consumption.  Price  developments  worsened  such  that deflators of most domestic demand components rose at an   annual   rate   of   around   3%;   import   and   export deflators, under the impulse of the euro’s weakness and for imports the additional effect of the rise in oil prices, recorded  annual  rises  of  around  10%.  The  worsened inflation  performance  reflected  domestic  pressures  as well  as  external  factors:  there  was  increasing  evidence of higher rates of service sector inflation and in addition the  national  CPI  inflation  rate  was  aggravated  by  the effect of higher loan interest rates. In this cost and price environment    attention    increased    on    the    risks    of overheating,  and  the  government  attributed  restrictive multi-annual spending guidelines announced in March to the need to reduce these risks. Indicators available for the second half of 2000 point to changes   in   the   balance   of   expenditure   growth.   A slowdown    will    be    most    pronounced    for    private consumption and merchandise imports. This follows the very  high  spending  in  the  first  half  and  in  reaction  to reduced real income gains because of the sharp increase in inflation and negative wealth effects as share markets have suffered sharp declines. The household saving ratio is still likely to have fallen significantly compared with 1999.  For  government  consumption,  fixed  investment and exports some reaction can be expected to apparently anomalously low expenditure earlier in the year. Annual export   growth   should   thus   still   be   high.   With   the exception   of   weakened   consumer   confidence,   other survey indicators point to business confidence remaining quite robust and growth this year is forecast at just under 5%, after an upwardly revised 4% in 1999. Employment growth  has  strengthened  after  an  uncertain  start  to  the year  to  around  2%,  with  both  rising  participation  and declining unemployment. The surplus in public finances continues  on  an  increasing  trend  and  should  be  of  the order some 4%  of  GDP,  over  double  its  level  in  1999. Despite a decline in the private sector financial surplus between the two years, national saving increases and is mirrored  by  a  rise  in  the  current  external  surplus,  to 6½% of GDP Outlook  for  2001  and  2002. While  growth  in  2000 should  be  particularly  strong  from the  impulse  of  high private consumption and continued buoyant net exports, some  deceleration  is  likely  in  2001  and  2000  due  to industrial   capacity   constraints,   with   the   risks   from overheating  increasing  if  this  slowing  does  not  occur. Even  so,  output  is  still  projected  to  move  somewhat ahead  of  the   increase   in   trend   capacity.   Overall,   a decline in the inflation rate and labour income tax cuts result   in   a   slight   acceleration   in   real   household disposable income in 2001 but a technical assumption of smaller tax cuts the following year combined with more moderate  output  and  employment  growth  produce  a slowdown   in   2002.   Wage   growth   is   assumed   to moderate from 2001. After the fall in the saving rate in 2000,   the   rate   of   household   saving   is   projected   to recover partially in the following two years and private consumption   rises   more   slowly.   Although   business investment should be fairly strong, given the conditions of   rising   profitability   and   capacity   concerns,   this expenditure will not be sufficient  to  prevent  an  overall slowing of domestic demand growth which will also be matched by    a gradually    less dynamic external environment. Domestic demand. Growth decelerates by about a half- percentage point in both 2001 and 2002, more moderate than  the  deceleration  in  private  consumption.  Public consumption is  expected  to  remain  subdued  as  a  result of tight volume expenditure limits. In addition to higher business investment to meet capacity concerns, continuing high levels of internal migration is expected to  stimulate  residential  and  other  private  construction investment,   although   shortages   of   land   zoned   for construction   and   skilled   construction   labour   have become increasingly evident and will constrain growth. Government  investment,  like  consumption,  is  expected to grow more slowly. Labour   market. Employment   growth   is   expected   to decelerate,  maintaining  overall  productivity  growth  at around  2½%,  with  a  much  higher  rate  of  productivity growth in manufacturing, such that most jobs are in the more labour-intensive construction and services sectors. Rising  participation  slows  the  reduction  in  the  rate  of unemployment, to below 9% in 2002. Wages and prices . There are prospects that a centralised two-year  wage  agreement  will  be  concluded  for  2001- 02. An assumption has been made that this will result in annual  compensation  increases  of  3½%  p.a.  or  below, slightly down on 2000 and without clawback of higher- than-expected  inflation  in  2000.  This  is  sufficient  to result in a low rate of increase in unit labour costs, and with the effects of exchange rate depreciation and higher oil prices fading in impact, inflation moderates, though slowly. Public  finances. The  central  government  budget  for 2001   announced   in   September   proposes   inflation- adjusted labour income tax reductions of 0.6% of GDP, with   no   other   major   tax   proposals.   A   technical assumption   is   made   of   a   further   ¼%   point   of   tax reductions   in   2002.   With   high   economic   growth, primary  expenditure  tightly  controlled   and   a   falling interest  burden  from  continuing  debt  redemption,  the general   government   surplus   continues   to   increase, reaching  5%  of  GDP  in  2002.  Tax  and  expenditure ratios continue to fall in relation to GDP. Although debt will   decrease   in   absolute   and   relative   terms,   the reduction is forecast to be slowed by planned gross asset accumulation.		
November/2000	Denmark	Temporary growth acceleration in 2000	Following   a   policy-induced   growth   pause   in   1999, aimed  at  avoiding  a  situation  of  overheating  of  the Danish  economy,  2000  will  see  a  temporary  growth acceleration,  due  to  a  large  extent  to  the  repair  works after the storm last December. Given that the economy operates  at  a  level  which  is  close  to  or  even  slightly above  its  potential,  more  moderate  growth  rates  are projected for 2001 and 2002. Growth  in  2000. Economic  activity  is  accelerating  in 2000 and overall GDP growth is estimated at some 2.6 %.  Growth  in  private  consumption  remains  subdued, mainly  due  to  a  persistence  of  the  weakness  in  car purchases.  New  car  registrations  have  fallen  by  more than   20   %   year-on-year,   seemingly   caused   by   the increase in energy prices, the gradual lowering of the tax deduction of interest payments included in the 1998 tax package  and  a  relative  “saturation”  of  the  markets  for new  cars.  Gross  fixed  capital  formation,  in  contrast,  is rising strongly, both in the  construction  and  equipment sectors. Investment in the construction sector is mainly boosted by repair works and contributes significantly to the   expansion   of   output   this   year.   Investment   in equipment has also risen strongly, partly linked to rising profits, above all in the manufacturing sector, since the turn of the year. Exports of goods have shown moderate growth  rates  –  especially  in  comparison  to  the  robust expansion    of    Danish    export    markets.    Somewhat surprisingly,  Danish  companies  seem  to  loose  market shares mainly outside the EU – despite the depreciation of the Danish krone . Outlook for 2001 and 2002. In 2001, domestic demand growth  is  expected  to  decelerate,  mainly  due  to  lower prospects  for  investment.  Whereas  growth  in  private consumption should gradually resume strength, since the strong  fall   in   car   purchases   should   taper   off,   it   is nevertheless likely to remain moderate as the rise in real disposable income should be restrained and employment growth   is   likely   to   weaken.   On   the   other   hand, investment  in  construction  is  expected  to  fall   -  as  the bulk of the repair works will be completed by then – and investment in equipment is projected to grow at a more moderate  rate.  Lower  relative  increases  in  Danish  unit labour costs should allow exports to rise at a rate that is closer  to  the  growth  rate  of  export  markets  whereas import  growth  is  projected  to  slacken  slightly  in  line with final demand. Overall, GDP is expected to rise by some 2.3 %. In  2002,  expansion  of  domestic  demand,  mainly  in private  consumption  and  gross  fixed  capital  formation, is projected to strengthen in comparison to 2001. While exports  are  anticipated  to  decline  slightly  –  in  tandem with   external   demand,   growth   in   imports   should accelerate slightly. Output in 2002 is forecast to expand by some 2.4 %. With  the  Danish  economy  expected  to  grow  at  a  more moderate   speed   than   its   main   trading   partners,   the current account balance is forecast to improve gradually both in 2001 and in 2002. Labour market. The strong job creation experienced up to  1999  has  reduced  speed  and  employment  growth  is projected to increase by less than one per cent in 2000 and  by  beneath  half  a  per  cent  in  2001  and  2002. Unemployment  is  expected  to  fall  slightly  throughout the forecast period and to decline to below 5  %  of  the labour  force  in  2002.  As  this  unemployment  rate  is considered to be close to or below most estimates of the NAIRU,  the  labour  market  situation  will  remain  tight. Given  the  already  high  participation  rate,  it  remains  a main challenge for Danish economic policy to raise the labour supply and thus to avoid supply side constraints both in the short and medium-term. Wages. Compensation  of  employees  per  head  should increase by slightly above 4 % in 2000. However, data for  wage  increases  per  hour  indicate  a  more  moderate pay  rise  and  incorporated  in  the  former  figure  is  an increase  in  overtime  work,  mainly  linked  to  the  repair works  in  the  construction  sector.  Wage  increases  per head  are  likely  to  be  lower  in  2001  as  employees  are expected  to  trade  the  additional  week  of  paid  annual leave (mainly implemented in 2001 in accordance with the  collective  agreements  for  the  private  sector)  for lower  pay  rises.  Bearing  in  mind  the  continued  tight labour  market  situation,  wage  increases  per  head  are projected to go up somewhat in 2002. Prices. Consumer prices started to rise at the start of last year,   in   the   beginning   mainly   driven   by   domestic factors. However, since the middle of 1999 high energy and  import  prices  have  played  a  dominant  role  behind the  price  increases,  but  inflationary  pressures  should gradually lose pace as the externally induced price rises taper off. The harmonised consumer price index (HICP) is  estimated  to  rise  by  2.8  %  this  year,  and  thereafter gradually  fall  back  to  2.4  %  in  2001  and  to  1.8  %  in 2002. Public  finances. Danish  general  government  finances should  remain  in  a  solid  position  over  the  forecasting period.  In  2000  a  budget  surplus  of  2.6  %  of  GDP  is expected.   For   2001,   the   government’s   budget   bill suggests   a   slight   expansionary   fiscal   stance,   among others due to increased investment in the education and health sectors. On the other hand, the structural impact of the 1998 tax package (aimed at strengthening savings incentives)  is  assumed  to  continue  to  exert  a  small dampening  effect  on  economic  activity.  Moreover,  an auction of UMTS licences is planned to take place at the latest  in  the  autumn  of  2001.  A  cautious  technical assumption of the proceeds, corresponding to 0.5  %  of GDP, raises the government surplus to 3.3 % of GDP in the   coming   year.   The   consolidated   gross   debt   is projected to decline markedly to some 41 % of GDP at the end of the forecast period.		
November/2000	Sweden	In the middle of a strong and broad- based expansion	Output. The  Swedish  economy  performed  strongly  in 1999  and  real  GDP  accelerated  to  3.8%.   Growth  was sustained mostly by domestic demand, with both private consumption   and   investment   achieving   high   growth rates.   The   external   side   contributed   as   well,   with relatively   strong   net   exports. Growth   of   domestic demand  has  been  sustained  by  continued  favourable monetary conditions. The Riksbank has left the repo-rate unchanged  at  3.75%  since  February  this  year,  largely due to subdued inflationary pressures in spite of higher oil  prices. While  economic  growth  has  been  solid recently, there is still potential for employment to grow and  productivity  growth  is  expected  to  be  relatively strong  over  the  forecast  period.  This  should  allow  for continued  robust  GDP  growth,  without  inflation  rising beyond  the  Riksbank’s  inflation  target  of  2%  (+/-  1 percentage point).   This implies that the outlook for the Swedish economy is positive and strong demand growth should be accommodated by good output growth without much  of  a  rise  in  inflationary  pressures. With  high consumption,  strong  investment,  and  high  employment growth,  GDP  is  expected  to  continue  to  grow  above trend  at  4.0%  in  2000,  3.7%  in  2001,  and  at  3.2%  in 2002. GDP components. Household consumption is expected to grow strongly over the forecast period, due to higher disposable incomes, stemming from lower income tax in 2000  and  2001  and  continued  employment  growth.  In 2000 in particular, consumption should continue to grow well   with   consumer   confidence   at   historically   high levels  and  retail  sales  growing  briskly  so  far  this  year. Furthermore,  the  tax  cuts  introduced  in  the  budget  for 2001,  totalling  some  0.6%  of  GDP,  should  stimulate household  spending.  However,  the  strong  growth  of spending  on  durables  is  expected  to  ease  slightly  in 2002. After modest growth in construction investment in 2000, this should increase strongly, particularly housing investment, in both 2001 and 2002, due to high demand for  housing.  Equipment  investment  should  show  good growth  rates  in  2000,  and  is  expected  to  accelerate  in 2001, as capacity utilisation is at high levels. As demand slows  down  somewhat  in  2002,  investment  growth  is expected  to  weaken,  although  housing  investment  is likely to continue to grow robustly. In 2000, exports are projected to accelerate, as demand for Swedish exports among the main trading partners picks up. In particular, the strong performance in the telecom industries, which contributes significantly to total exports, is expected to continue.   In   2001   and   2002,   export   growth   should continue  to  grow  relatively  strongly,  albeit  at  a  lower pace,  as  external  demand  moderates  somewhat.  With strong    domestic    demand,    in    particular    household consumption  expenditure  but  also  investment,  imports are  also  expected  to  grow  strongly  over  the  forecast period. Price  developments. While  inflation  remained  low  in 1999,  averaging  0.3%  as  measured  by  the  CPI,  it  has increased  in  2000  but  remained  fairly  stable  in  recent months, at a bit above 1%, despite high oil prices, and stood  at  1.3%  in  September.  As  the  labour  market tightens  further  and  economic  growth  continues  to  be high in 2001 and 2002, a small increase in inflationary pressures  is  expected  to  emerge  and  inflation  could accelerate towards 2% by 2002. It is expected however that  the  Riksbank  will  successfully  fulfil  its  task  in ensuring that the inflation target, of 2% +/- 1 percentage point,   is   not   breached,   though   with   some   further tightening of the monetary policy stance. It is expected that the strong commitment to the inflation target should result  in  only  slightly  higher  wage  increases  over  the forecast  period  and  that  these  will  be  accompanied  by good productivity. The result will be sustainable rises in unit wage costs. Labour market. Employment grew substantially by more than  2%  during  1999  and  unemployment  fell  to  7.2%. Continued   relatively   strong   employment   growth   is expected to be achieved, albeit at a lower pace, through an increase in labour force participation, partly due to a reduction  in  labour-market  programmes,  in  addition  to demand-driven  employment  expansion.  The  number  of unemployed is therefore expected to fall each year until 2002, when the unemployment rate should reach 5.4%. Although   some   sectors   appear   to   face   increasing difficulties  in  recruiting  staff,  there  are  no  signs  of widespread  labour  shortages  yet.  While  the  fact  that unfilled   vacancies   has   increased   faster   than   new vacancies  so  far  this  year  suggests  increased  matching problems,   the   observed   large   differences   between sectors  and  regions  should  permit  further  employment growth. The functioning of the labour market  seems  to have  improved  in  recent  years,  with  moderate  wage increases and a tendency towards a closer link between productivity  and  wage  growth  at  a  decentralised  level. This trend is expected to continue over the coming years and, in particular, in the wage negotiations starting this winter.  In  all,  these  factors,  together  with  the  credible fulfilment of the inflation  target,  are  expected  to  result in    relatively    strong    employment    growth    without resulting in highly inflationary wage increases over the forecast period. Public finances. The efforts made to reduce the general government deficit since the early nineties have proven successful   and   Sweden   now   exhibits   sound   public finances.   A   surplus   in   government   finances   was recorded  in  1998  and  1999  and  larger  surpluses  are expected   in   2000-2002.   The   favourable   economic position    and    continued    adherence    to    the    central government   expenditure   ceilings   contributes   to   the strong fiscal position. The credibility of the governments'   ability   not   to   breach   the   expenditure ceiling for central government is strong. In addition, the reduction  in  public  debt  is  expected  to  contribute  to lower interest payments. In 2000, the surplus is expected to be 3.5% of GDP and in 2001 and 2002 it is expected to  increase  to  3.6%  and  4.1%  of  GDP,  respectively, driven  by the  strong economic  growth.  This  more  than outweighs  the  effects  of  the  lowering  of  taxes  in  2000 and  2001.  Debt  relative  to  GDP  is  projected  to  fall  to below 60% of GDP in 2000, partly due to the use of the proceeds from the flotation of shares in Telia to reduce debt,  and,  further,  to  some  47%  of  GDP  at  the  end  of 2002,  as  the  strong  budget  surpluses  described  above take effect.		
November/2000	United Kingdom	Good growth expected to continue with inflation remaining subdued	Output in the first half of 2000 rose by 3.1% on the same period  one  year  earlier.  Growth  was  broadly  sustained by especially strong household consumption and a large rise  in  exports  despite  sterling's  strength.  (The  latter were  supported  by  good  growth  in  the  UK's  overseas markets).   These   were   partly   offset   by   a   weaker investment  performance  than  seen  in  recent  years  and rapidly rising imports; the latter driven by strong growth in  domestic  demand  and,  probably,  sterling’s  strength. The labour market is strong with unemployment down to a  little  over  5%  but  with  not  much  in  the  way  of accompanying pressures on wages. Average earnings are growing  at  around  a  sustainable  4%  a  year  and  wage settlements  also  show  a  subdued  picture.  Productivity, having risen slowly for a long period, grew by 2.5% year on  year,  in  the  second  quarter.  Despite  the  recent  oil price rise, inflationary pressures remain very weak - on the HICP measure, inflation is around 1% and amongst the lowest in the EU. The government's target measure of RPIX  inflation is well under the 2.5% target. Forecast  output .  The  strong growth  of  the  first  half  of the year is likely to have persisted into the second half; though  on  the  preliminary  measure,  third  quarter  GDP grew  a  little  under  3%  at  an  annual  rate.  Retail  sales volumes and export volumes have remained strong and some   revival   in   manufacturing   output   has   occurred though, again, imports have risen rapidly. Despite strong growth in activity in recent months, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England (MPC) have kept the repo rate unchanged, since last February, at 6% because inflationary   pressures   and   prospects   have   remained muted. Monetary policy has indeed been associated with respectable non inflationary growth and the outturn for GDP  growth  in  2000  as  a  whole  is  projected  at  3.1%. Looking  towards  2001  and  2002,  some  slight  slowing down in growth is expected. However, the fundamentals of   continuing   strong   household   consumption,   strong government  consumption  and  investment  as  well  as export  growth  will  ensure  that  final  demand  remains strong over the forecast period. The expectation is  that rising demand will be accommodated by rises in output with  no  big  upsurge  in  inflation.  While  the  labour market  is  tight,  a  modest  rise  in  the  employment  rate accompanied by respectable growth in labour productivity should ensure that GDP would grow at 3% in   both   2001   and   2002.   Strong   growth   in   fixed investment in recent years will also reduce problems of capacity  constraints.   Oil   price   rises   are   unlikely   to impact much on growth - the UK is a net exporter of oil. Output  components .  Household  consumption  growth  is expected to be maintained well in 2000, 2001 and 2002 as real earnings are expected to grow moderately and the labour  market  remains  strong.  Nevertheless  some  slow down is expected as households lift the saving ratio from current low levels in the face of what are still high real interest  rates  and  rebuild  their  financial  position  from what   is   expected   to   be   a   deficit   in   2000.   Recent weakness  in  the  equity  market  and  a  cooling  of  the housing market should also act to restrain consumption somewhat.  Export  growth  is  expected  to  remain  strong but slower than in 2000 as growth in UK markets slows. Government  consumption  and  investment  are  expected to    be    major    contributors    to    demand    growth    as established in the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review that details spending plans to 2003-04. Non-government  fixed  investment  is  expected  to  show slower growth than in recent years but this reflects  the absence  of  major  capacity  constraints  following  some years of very strong investment growth. Labour  Market .  The  labour  market  has  continued  to strengthen with unemployment hitting a twenty five year low  recently.  Its  rate  now  stands  at  5.3%  on  the  ILO count.  Employment  is  also  growing  well  and  rose  by 1.2%  in  the  year  to  May-July  of  2000.  Wage  earnings are   subdued.   The   labour   market    is    expected    to strengthen further over the forecast period. Some small rise in the employment rate is expected as labour market measures such as the ‘new deal’ continue to impact but growth will slow and the fall in unemployment to 2002 will be more modest than recent drops. Rather, the major supply  side  contributor  to  economic  growth,  will  be productivity  growth  in  excess  of  2%  a  year.  This  is  a little  higher  than  historical  experience  would  suggest. Nevertheless the rise is expected to be sustainable in the near term and accords with decent rises in productivity in  recent  quarters.  These  may  be  associated  with  the strong boost to business investment in recent years and, in particular, the high level of inward direct investment. Accordingly,  unit  wage  costs  rises  are  expected  to  be moderate and sustainable over the forecast period. External balance . The current account is projected to be in  modest  deficit  of  around  1.5%  of  GDP  over  the forecast period. This is not thought to constitute a major imbalance. In particular, the negative contribution of net exports   of   goods   and   services   to   GDP   growth   is expected to be less than in recent years. Prices .  Inflation  is  very  low  on  the  HICP  measure, despite oil price rises, and below the RPIX 2.5% target. It  is  expected  that  the  latter  will  continue  to  be  met. Current  and  expected  benign  developments  of  wage inflation and, consequently, unit labour costs, may mean that  not  much,  if  any,  in  the  way  of  further  monetary tightening will be necessary. However, the inflation rate may  tick  up  a  little  as  the  recent,  strong,  downward competitive pressure on retail margins eases a little. Public  finances .  The  general  government  finances  are expected  to  remain  in  healthy  surplus  over  the  period. They  have  been,  and  will  continue  to  be,  buoyed  by strong   growth   in   revenues   associated   with   strong economic  growth.  This  will  be  partly  offset  by  the growth  in  planned  current  and  investment  expenditure, announced  recently.  Though  the  proceeds  of  sales  of UMTS  licences  will  boost  the  finances  in  a  ‘one  off’ fashion  in  2000,  to  yield  a  surplus  in  excess  of  4%  of GDP,  the  resulting  reduction  in  debt  interest  will  also make  a  significant  contribution  to  large  government surpluses of around 2% of GDP in both 2001 and 2002. Consequently, the ratio of gross debt to GDP will fall to around 30% by the end of 2002.		
April/2001	Belgium	Slower  but  still  robust  economic  activity in 2001 and 2002	Output . In 2000 real GDP growth reached about 4%, the highest  rate  in  the  last  ten  years;  in  2001  and  2002, economic  growth  is  expected  to  slow  somewhat  but  to remain  robust  at  around  3%.  A  deterioration  in  the external   economic   environment,   reflecting  a   marked slowdown  in  the  US  economy  and  lower  growth  of international   trade   is   expected   to   affect   the   export performance    of    the    open    economy    of    Belgium. However,   the   sound   economic   fundamentals   of   the Belgian economy, a notable progress towards budgetary adjustment and ongoing structural reforms in the labour and  product  markets,  should  contribute  to  sustained economic  activity  and  employment  creation.  Prospects for   a   lower   tax   burden,   made   possible   by   fiscal consolidation   and   improved   public   finances,   should continue  supporting  the  confidence  of  households  and enterprises  and  affecting  positively  their  consumption and investment decisions. Prospects. Private consumption, after rising strongly by 2.9%  in  2000  is  expected  to  slow  somewhat  but  to remain  sustained  in  2001  and  in  2002  supported  by employment growth and the increase in households real disposable income. As in recent years, the saving ratio of households has declined, reflecting renewed confidence   underpinned   by   progress   in   the   public finance    situation,    which    raises    prospects    of    tax alleviation.  Moreover,  households  have  drawn  on  their savings in order to compensate for the negative effect on disposable  income  of  higher  oil  prices  and  to  maintain their consumption pattern. The saving ratio is expected to  rise  marginally  in  2001  and  in  2002,  as  households would tend to rebuild their financial wealth. Investment   in   real   terms   is   projected   to   remain reasonably dynamic in the coming two years, at around 4%   per   year   on   average,   due   mainly   to   business investment  while  government  investment  should  grow more slowly, notably in 2001, compared to the high rate registered in 2000, a year of local elections. Satisfactory business  profitability  and  expected  sustained  domestic and  foreign  demand  should  ensure  a  reasonably  robust investment spending in the coming two years; high rates of  capacity  utilisation  should  also  work  in  the  same direction. The  contribution  of  the  external  sector  to  GDP  growth should  remain  positive  in  2001  and  in  2002,  though considerably    lower    than    the    1    percentage    point registered  in  2000  - the  highest  for  almost  20  years.  A relatively more robust economic activity within the EU, compared with the rest of the world, in the coming two years  should  favour  Belgian  exports  mainly  oriented towards European economies. Labour  market .  Employment  creation  was  strong  in 2000  - some  68,000  new  jobs  were  created -  and  is expected to continue, though at a slower pace, in 2001 and  2002  supported  by  robust  economic  activity  and, also,   by   the   positive   effects   of   active   employment measures,  in  particular  the  considerable  reduction  in recent  years  of  social  security  contributions  paid  by employers   -   particularly   important   in   2000-   which should    continue    supporting    labour    demand.    The unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  decline  further  over the  coming  years  though  by  less  than  the  employment creation rate as labour supply is also projected to rise. Prices    and    wages .    Consumer    price    inflation,    as measured by the HICP, should fall to just below 2% this year  and  even  lower  in  2002,  after  reaching  2.7%  in 2000 mainly as a result of the impact of oil price rises and  the  depreciation  of  the  euro.  Lower  oil  prices  and some  appreciation  of  the  euro  would  contribute  to  the projected  price  deceleration  while  domestic  inflation pressures should remain contained: wage moderation is expected   to   prevail,   supported   by   the   reasonably moderate  terms  of  the  framework  wage  agreement  for 2001-2002, concluded last December. However, tightening labour markets and labour shortages in some market segments may create wage pressures, but  these, should remain contained. Public   finances .   Fiscal   developments   in   2000   were marked   by   the   balance   achieved   in   the   general government accounts, the  first  in  50  years;  higher  than expected economic activity and fiscal revenues contributed  significantly  to  this  development.  Public finances  are  expected  to  improve  further  in  the  period forecast, supported by high primary surpluses, above 6% of   GDP   per   year,   and   reduced   interest   payments resulting from a falling government debt ratio. A general government  surplus  of  0.6%  of  GDP  is  forecast  for 2001, including UMTS receipts estimated at about 0.2% of  GDP,  and  a  surplus  of  0.7%  of  GDP  in  2002.  The government  debt  ratio  is  expected  to  fall  to  104.3%  of GDP this year and decline further to 98.5% of GDP in 2002. These projections imply a faster fiscal adjustment than was foreseen in the updated stability programme of Belgium  2001-2005   which,   however,   was   based   on lower real GDP growth assumptions, 2.5%, for this year and  for  2002.  A  notable  feature  of  the  public  finance projections  is  the  decline  in  the  tax  burden  and  the government expenditure ratio. The forecasts have taken into    account    fiscal    measures    already    adopted    or announced,  including some  tax  cuts  in  2001,  while  the more  comprehensive  personal  income  tax  reform to  be implemented  during  2002-2006  will  have  only  a  small budgetary impact on 2002.		
April/2001	Germany	International slowdown takes its toll	Output  in  2000. GDP  rose  by  3.0  %  in  2000,  the  best performance since the reunification boom. Much of the acceleration in economic activity can be attributed to a favourable  external  environment  and  improvements  in external competitiveness thanks to a low euro exchange rate  and  falling  unit  labour  costs.  As  a  result,  exports grew by an impressive 13.2 %. With growth of imports falling  significantly  short  of  this  figure,  the  external balance added a full percentage point to output growth. Domestic  demand,  by  contrast,  rose  rather  moderately. This  was  due  mainly  to  a  lack  of  vigour  in  private consumption,  notably  in  the  second  half  of  the  year. Real consumer expenditure, while benefiting from rising employment,  suffered  from a  loss  in  purchasing  power as  a  result  of  a  strongly  negative  terms  of  trade  effect brought about by the euro depreciation and the rise in oil prices. Little additional impulse came from investment. Buoyant growth in equipment investment, particularly in the  first  half-year,  was  largely  counterbalanced  by  a construction  sector  which  remains  bogged  down  in  the mire. Average annual output growth for Germany would have been half a percentage point higher in the second half   of   the   1990s   if   the   construction   sector   had developed in line with the rest of the economy. The drag on growth was particularly sharp in the “New Länder”, where  the  construction  sector  continues  to  slim  down from   the   over-capacity   built   up   during   the   post- unification building boom. Short-term   growth   outlook. Even   before   the   sharp deterioration  in  the  US  economy  became  apparent,  the German economy started to show signs of a slowdown. Business  sentiment  (as  measured  by  the  IFO  climate indicator) has weakened from mid-2000 on, while output growth fell significantly between the first and the second half  of  the  year  of  2000.  However,  even  though  world economic growth looks set to slow down significantly in 2001, foreign orders in Germany have continued to rise over the recent period and industrial production has held steady  so  far.  As  a  result,  the  slowdown  in  economic activity  in  2001  should  be  limited  and,  thanks  to  the assumed  improvement  in  the  external  environment,  a recovery can be expected in 2002. Output growth is thus projected to be around 2¼ % in 2001 and a little more than 2½ % in 2002. A  key  element  in  this  projection  is  that  the  German export sector is assumed to remain very competitive. In particular, on top of the depreciation of the euro over the past  two  years,  Germany  is  reaping  the  benefits  of several  years  of  wage  moderation  which  has  led  to  a significant decline in relative unit labour costs. Overall, therefore, exports should continue to rise at solid rates in both 2001 and 2002. However, as imports are expected to grow even faster as a result of lower import prices and the pick-up of domestic demand, the external contributiontogrowthisprojectedtodeclinetozeroin 2001. Part of the fall in the growth contribution of the external sector  should  be  compensated  for  by  faster  growing domestic demand, invigorated by tax reforms that reduce the tax burden on enterprises and households by around 1 %  of  GDP.  Lower  taxes  and  lower  oil  prices  should combine to give a boost to private consumption. At the same time, equipment investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from a relatively high rate of capacity utilisation  and  still  solid  levels  of  orders.  By  contrast, prospects for the construction sector remain bleak. Employment. On  the  back  of  the  strong  expansion  in activity  in  2000,  employment  rose  by  1.6  %  or  almost 600,000  on  an  annual  average.  There  are,  however, indications that much of this new employment occurred in part-time jobs and in the segment  of  low paid  ‘630- DM–jobs’. This would explain why fast job creation did not translate into a stronger rise in private consumption. It could furthermore be the main reason why the number of unemployed went down by a mere 200,000 (from 4.1 million in 1999 to 3.9 million last year), as the new jobs were  mainly  filled  by  persons  previously  outside  the labour   force.   Despite   the   expected   deceleration   in growth,   the   number   of   unemployed   is   projected   to continue to decline to around 3.7 million in 2001 and to about   3.4   million   in   2002,    thanks    not    only   to demographic  trends  but  also  to  an  expanding  service sector,    where    continued    wage    moderation    should provide  an  additional  impetus  to  employment  growth, especially   in   2001.   However,   little   improvement   is expected for the labour market in the New Länder where the construction sector will continue its downsizing. Inflation. Against  a  background  of  sharply  rising  oil prices,   the   year   2000   saw   a   clear   acceleration   in consumer  prices,  resulting  in  an  average  annual  price increase of 2.1 % (HICP). As a consequence of a rise in some  indirect  taxes  at  the  beginning  of  2001,  second round  effects  of  the  oil  price  hike  on  some  goods  and services  (e.g.  prices  of  gas  and  package  tours)  and rapidly  rising  food  prices  consumer  prices  continued their  upward  trend  in  the  first  months  of  the  current year,  bringing  the  year-on-year  index  to  significantly above  2%.  However,  consumer  price  inflation  should decline in the course of the year as a result of falling oil prices  and  continued  moderate  wage  increases  (with most of the contract wages for 2001 agreed in early 2000 and  thus  not  reflecting  higher  than  expected  consumer prices   in   2000).   In   2002,   in   spite   of   the   assumed acceleration  in  wage  growth  consumer  prices  should continue to decline as growth picks up only moderately and   import   prices   are   expected   to   remain   broadly unchanged. Public Finance. Due to UMTS receipts worth 2.5 % of GDP, the general government balance showed a surplus of 1.5 % of GDP in 2000 (i.e. net of UMTS proceeds a deficit of 1.0 % of GDP was recorded). This outcome is due  to  a  decline  in  nominal  expenditure  at  the  federal level,  while  expenditure  at  other  levels  of  government exceeded  the  agreed  ceiling  in  the  framework  of  the “Finanzplanungsrat”  of  November  1999.  In  the  current year, the implementation of the third step of the income tax reform and of the corporate tax reform coupled with lower   output   growth   than   underlying   the   budget assumption  are  expected  to  drive  the  deficit  of  the general government up to 1.7% of GDP, slightly above the target of 1.5 %. With growth prospects for 2002 also slightly   revised   downwards,   application   of   the   “no policy change” assumption results in a deficit projection of some 1¼ % of GDP		
April/2001	Greece	Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate	Substantial  stabilisation  efforts  undertaken  throughout the  1990s  resulted  in  achieving  nominal  convergence with  the  rest  of  the  euro  zone.  This  has  boosted  the overall performance of the economy while the objective of  joining  the  euro  area  as  of  January  2001  has  been achieved.  The  conversion  rate  of  the  Greek  drachma against  the  euro  was  fixed  at  the  central  rate  of  the drachma in ERM II, that is 340,75 GRD per euro. GDP growth and its components. Real GDP growth has been   above   the   EU   average   since   1996.   Economic activity  accelerated  in  2000,  rising  by  4.1%;  this  was mainly due to strong growth in investment, particularly investment in equipment; exports also accelerated after a pause,  registered  in  1999,  entailed  by  faltering  export market growth. However, strong exports were more than offset   by   a   fast   rise   in   imports,   resulting   in   a deterioration of the external balance.  Growth  prospects should  improve  further  in  2001  and  2002:  tax  reforms and falling interest rates are expected to support private consumption and investment; in addition, non- residential construction is assumed to accelerate further, in  view  of  the  preparation  for  the  Olympic  Games  of 2004.  Thus,  despite  the  forecast  deceleration  in  world demand  in  2001,  real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  rise throughout the period to 2002, reaching 4.8%. Labour   market .   The   situation   in   the   labour   market improved in 2000. Employment increased by 1.2% and the unemployment rate declined, though it still exceeded 10%.    Sustained    activity    and    the    continuation    of structural reform efforts are expected to support further improvement  in  employment  throughout  the  forecast period. Real  wages  decelerated  further  in  2000,  reflecting  a restrictive  incomes  policy  in  the  public  sector  and  the two-year collective wage agreement signed in the private sector    in    May    2000.    Wage    increases    in    2000 incorporated  a  compensation  equal  to  0.7%  for  the increase  in  prices  in  excess  of  projected  inflation  in 1999;  however,  the  impact  of  this  adjustment  on  real wages was limited by non-anticipated inflation resulting from developments in oil prices during 2000. The 2000 wage agreement provides no compensation for inflation until the end of 2001; thus it is expected to contribute to wage  moderation  in  the  private  sector  until  2002;  as wages in the public sector will continue to be contained during  the  period,  a  moderate  increase  in  unit  labour costs in the whole economy can be reasonably expected. Prices .  Consumer  price  inflation  was  on  a  downward trend   until   the   third   quarter   of   1999;   since   then, developments   in   prices   have   been   dominated   by pressures stemming from surging oil prices. The national index of consumer prices increased by an annual average of  3.2%  in  2000  from  2.6%  in  1999.  Since  December 2000,  the  rate  of  increase  in  consumer  prices  slowed rising   by   3.5%   in   February   2001   from   3.9%   in December and 4.2% in November 2000 (national index, year-on-year).  Nonetheless,  some  concern  persists  with respect to price stability: underlying inflation, measured by  the  CPI  excluding  fresh  fruit,  vegetables  and  fuels, has   resumed   a   rising   trend   since   September   2000 although  it  still  remains  below  headline  inflation.  The inflation forecast for 2001 and 2002 is influenced by a number  of  opposing  factors.  On  one  hand,  inflation pressures may emerge from the monetary easing implied by   the   fall   in   interest   rates   as   well   as   from   the acceleration in economic activity. On the other hand, the assumptions  for  primary  commodities  prices  and  oil prices justify a forecast of decelerating import prices in 2001.  Furthermore,  developments  in  unit  labour  costs and structural reforms, may support medium-term price stability.  Nonetheless,  some  risks  underlie  the  inflation forecast  for  2002;  they are  associated  with  the  pace  of implementation  of  structural  reforms  and  the  existence of a clause of adjustment of wages to prices in 2002, if average inflation is higher than anticipated in 2001. Public finances . The correction of fiscal imbalances has been among the main objectives of economic policy in the run-up to EMU. The general government deficit was reduced to 0.9% of GDP in 2000 from 1.8% in 1999 and 1.2% set in the budget for 2000. This was due to higher budget revenues, which resulted in more than offsetting an overrun in expenditure, both primary expenditure and interest   payments.   The   budgetary   accounts   of   the general government are forecast to be in balance in 2001 and  turn  into  a  surplus  of  0.6%  in  2002.  The  primary surplus, which increased to 6.4% of GDP in 2000 from 5.8% in 1999, is expected to  reach 6.7% of GDP in the remainder of the forecast period. The Greek government,  in  the  budget  for  2001  and  in  the  Greek Stability Programme presented in December 2000 under the  requirements  of  the  Stability  and  Growth  Pact,  is targeting a general government surplus already in 2001; this projection assumes higher GDP growth compared to Commission forecasts. Debt ratio . Rising primary surpluses, combined with the allocation of privatisation receipts to pay-off public debt resulted  in  reducing  the  debt  ratio  since  1996.  The expected  high  level  of  primary  surplus  throughout  the forecasting period  should  contribute  in  maintaining  the downward path of the debt ratio, which is forecast to fall below   100%   at   the   end   of   2001   and   to   continue declining thereafter.		
April/2001	Spain	Weaker but more balanced growth	Output. GDP  rose  strongly  by  around  4%  in  1999  and 2000.   This   robust   economic   growth   was   based   on domestic   demand   while   external   demand   showed   a negative   contribution.   However,   partly   due   to   the negative  impact  from  the  oil  price  hikes,  during  the second  half  of  2000  economic  activity  lost  strength. Growth of all domestic demand components moderated, especially   private   consumption   and   investment   in equipment, while the external sector contribution turned positive  as  imports  decelerated  in  line  with  domestic demand. As a result, for 2001, output growth is expected to moderate to 3.2% following the trends observed in the second half of 2000. In 2002 growth is forecast to rise slightly to around 3.3%. In   2001,   according   to   current   indicators,   domestic demand should remain moderate in line with the profile shown in the second half of 2000. The deterioration in the  economic  setting  should  negatively  affect  private consumption and investment in equipment, especially in the   first   part   of   the   year.   Less   dynamic   private consumption    would    reflect    a    moderation    in    real disposable income, the freezing of income tax brackets, implying  fiscal  drag,  and  slower  job   creation.   This moderation would be consistent with a slight recovery in the  saving  ratio,  which  has  recorded  historically  low figures   in   recent   years.   In   turn,   in   the   short-term, investment   in   equipment   will   be   affected   by   the worsening   in   the   economic   outlook.   The   external contribution to GDP growth should be slightly positive mainly  because  of  imports  decelerating  in  line  with domestic demand. In 2002 GDP growth is expected to rise slightly to 3.3%. This  would  stem  from  a  strengthening  of  all  domestic demand components other than investment in dwellings. Private    consumption    in    particular    is    foreseen    to accelerate  due  to  more  favourable  price  developments, implying an  increase  in  real  disposable  income,  and  to an  improvement  in  consumers’  expectations  reflecting stable  employment  creation   compared   to   2001.   The assumed  improvement  in  the  economic  setting  along with stronger private consumption and still low interest rates   should   push   up   investment   in   equipment.   In contrast,    investment    in    dwellings    is    forecast    to decelerate   in   2002.   This   deceleration   should   start towards the end of 2001, mainly in reaction to housing supply having grown faster than demand in recent years. Finally,  the  external  sector  is  forecast  to  post  a  small negative contribution since imports should gain strength due to the recovery of domestic demand. Labour  market. Employment  rose  briskly  by  3.3%  in 2000 but with a decelerating trend, especially during the second half of the year. In 2001 employment growth is expected to remain strong although moderating to 2.2%. This   moderation   is   based   mainly   on   an   expected deceleration in more labour-intensive activities, especially  construction  and  services,  which  have  been the more dynamic branches in job creation in the recent past. In 2002, employment growth is forecast to remain stable  compared  to  the  previous  year.  As  a  result,  the still very high unemployment rate should keep on a clear decreasing  path  during  the   forecasting  period:   from more than 14% in 2000 to around 12% in 2002. Prices. In  2000,  price  developments  were  worse  than expected due both to the behaviour of the more volatile items,    energy    and    unprocessed    food,    and    to    a deterioration  of  core  inflation.  The  HICP  for  2001  is forecast to decelerate to 3.2% average growth compared to  3.5%  in  the  previous  year.  This  is  based  on  the assumptions for import prices in 2001, a moderation in some  items  such  as  telecommunications  and  electricity tariffs and the deceleration in domestic  demand,  which should   help   to   dampen   inflationary   pressures.   In contrast,  the  unprocessed  food  component  is  likely  to push up prices more than expected previously due to the BSE crisis especially during the first half of the year. In addition, the second-round effects of last year’s oil price hike  will  be  visible  in  the  GDP  deflator  growth  rate compared to HICP inflation. Moreover, unit labour costs are  expected  to  remain  high  not  only  because  of  the slight  acceleration  in  compensation  per  head  but  also because of only moderate growth in labour productivity. In 2002, inflation is forecast to fall to 2.3% on average. External sector . The current account deficit is expected to fall gradually in 2001 and 2002. This is chiefly based on a growing surplus of services, which partially offset the  trade  deficit,  and  an  improvement  in  the  terms  of trade  during  the  forecsating  period.  As  a  result,  the deficit  vis-à-vis  the  rest  of  the  world  should  decrease from 2.2% of GDP in 2000 to 1.6% in 2002. Public finances . In 2000 the general government deficit fell to 0.3% of GDP compared to 1.2% in the previous year.  This  improvement  was  due  both  to  control  of current   expenditure   and   the   strength   in   revenues, especially  social  security  contributions  stemming  from strong   job   creation.   For   2001   general   government accounts  are  expected  to  register  a  surplus  of  0.1%  of GDP compared to the official target of balance. Such a surplus  should  be  possible  thanks  to  several  factors. Firstly,   tax   revenues,   although   decelerating   slightly, should  remain  strong  and  underpinned  by  fiscal  drag. Secondly,  fees  will  be  levied  on  UMTS  companies. These fees should represent a figure of around 0.15% of GDP.  Finally,  current  expenditure  is  expected  to  grow moderately with public consumption,  interest  payments and  social  benefits  declining  relative  to  GDP.  This deficit reduction should be compatible with an increase in public gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GDP  while  mantaining  active  labour  policies.  Only  a sharper  deceleration  in  economic  activity  to  below  3% might endanger the envisaged small surplus in 2001. In 2002, and under the assumption of no policy changes, the  general  government  balance  is  forecast  to  improve further, reaching a surplus of 0.2% of GDP. Stemming  from  increasing  primary  surpluses  together with relatively low interest rates the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected  to  continue  on  a  declining  path  during  the forecasting period. As a result, after declining to 60.6% in 2000, the debt ratio is forecast to fall just under 56% in 2002.		
April/2001	France	Economic activity set to remain robust over the next two years	The economy  in  2000 .  As  expected  in  the  last  Autumn forecasts, real GDP accelerated somewhat in the second half of 2000; the increase in real GDP rose to 3% at an annual rate as against 2.5% in the first half of the year. The acceleration resulted mainly from renewed dynamism in investment in equipment (which increased by  13.7%  in  annualised  terms  in  the  second  half  of 2000).  However,  the  oil-induced  rebound  in  inflation continued  in  the  second  half  of  2000  and  inflation peaked at 2.2% in December. In such a context, private consumption  growth  remained  relatively  disappointing. Overall, these figures suggest that the surge in oil prices did not affect dramatically the French economy in 2000: despite    a    slowdown    in    economic    activity    when compared  to  1999,  real  GDP  remained  on  a  robust upward trend. Prospects. In  spite  of  a  significant  worsening  in  the external environment, economic activity is not expected to decelerate significantly in France in  2001  and  2002, and  real  GDP  should  expand  by  slightly  below  3%  a year,  a  still  high  rate  by  French  historical  standards. Domestic  demand  should  remain  the  mainstay  of  the current  phase  of  expansion.  In  fact,  the  slight  forecast slowdown  in  real  GDP  in  2001  and  2002  reflects  the influence of several factors. First, while export markets growth  is  expected  to  remain  stable,  gains  in  export market share resulting from the past depreciation of the euro   are   expected   to   vanish   gradually.   Second,   the positive  impact  of  the  tax  cut  package  on  domestic demand will diminish over the forecast period. Finally, the  emergence  of  constraints  on  the  supply  side  of  the economy  could  gradually  exert  a  dampening  effect  on activity. GDP components . The dynamism of private consumption observed before the second quarter of 2000 was temporarily interrupted in the three last quarters of 2000.  This  slowdown  was  clearly  associated  with  the loss  in  purchasing  power  of  households  due  to  the increase  in  oil  prices.  From  the  beginning  of  2001, private  consumption  growth  should  resume  and  remain firm  throughout  the  forecast  period.  Gross  disposable income,  which  should  continue  to  benefit  from  the positive  employment  trend,  is  expected  to  be  bolstered by  three  more  factors.  First,  wage  increases  should gradually   rise,   triggered   by   the   rapid   fall   in   the unemployment  rate  and  the  past  increase  in   prices. Second, the implementation of the multi-annual tax cuts programme  will  sustain  personal  disposable  income  in 2001. Third, part of the loss in purchasing power caused by  the  increase  in  oil  prices  should  be  reversed  in  the course of 2001, the inflation rate gradually coming back closer to its underlying component Since  demand  prospects  remain  very  positive  and  the cost  of  borrowing  is  expected  to  stay  at  a  relatively moderate  level,  French  firms  will  probably  continue  to increase their production capacities, as it is suggested by the   results   of   the   latest   investment   survey   in   the manufacturing industry. Exports growth should slow gradually over the forecast period.  In  2001,  French  exporters  should  continue  to benefit  from  the  past  competitiveness  gains  associated with the depreciation of the euro. This effect is expected to   vanish   gradually   over   the   forecast   period.   As   a consequence,  the  contribution  of  net  exports  to  growth should fall slightly in 2002. Labour  market,  costs  and  prices. Underpinned  by  the dynamism    of    economic    activity,    the    increase    in employment    reached    an    historical    high    and    the unemployment  rate  continued  on  its  rapid  declining trend.   Despite   these   developments,   wage   increases remained subdued. This temperance reflected, partly, the moderating   impact   on   wages   of   the   working   time reduction agreements. Over the period covered by the forecast, labour market developments should remain clearly positive. Employment growth is expected to hold firm, although a slight deceleration might be registered resulting from a gradual  slowdown  in  activity  and  by  fading  effects  of employment policies. As a consequence, the unemployment  rate  will  continue  to  fall,  albeit  at  a slower   pace   than   observed   so   far.   This   forecast presupposes  a  sustained  increase  in  the  labour  force resulting  mainly  from  a  return  to  the  labour  market  of currently inactive people. In  this  context,  the  labour  market  should  continue  to tighten  in  the  next  two  years.  Consequently,  despite some  productivity  gains  and   cuts   in   social   security contributions    associated    with    the    35-hours    week agreements, growth in unit labour costs and underlying inflation is expected to accelerate in 2001 and 2002. The inflation rate should however remain roughly stable all along   2001,   a   further   decrease   in   the   oil   prices contribution being compensated by a parallel rise in the underlying component. Public    finances .    The    revision    of    macroeconomic prospects  affects  somewhat  negatively  the  projections for public finances. Government budgetary consolidation,  based  on  progressive  reduction  of  the expenditure  to  GDP  ratio  is  expected  to  continue  over the   period;   however,   the   decline   in   the   general government  deficit  will  be  slower  than  assumed  in  the Autumn  forecasts;  the  reduction  might  be  also  less pronounced than projected in the 2000 updated stability programme. The   general   government   deficit   - excluding   UMTS receipts - is now forecast to fall by only 0.5 percentage points of GDP over the period, to 0.8% of GDP in 2002. This  is  to  be  compared  with  the  objective  of  a  deficit ratio  of  0.6%  of  GDP  in  2002  included  in    the  2000 updated stability programme of France. This will reflect mainly automatic effects on government finances ratios and  tax  revenues  of  lower-than-expected  GDP  growth. The forecast assumes, that the  government  will  respect its  objectives  in  terms  of  real  expenditures.  Moreover, the  government  deficit  and  debt  ratio  projections  for 2001 are affected  by the  loss  of  UMTS  receipts  which will  probably  reach  0.5%  of  GDP  instead  of  1.1%  of GDP initially projected		
April/2001	Ireland	High but slowing growth with inflationary pressures	Output   in   2000 .   Real   GDP   growth   of   10.7   %   is estimated for 2000, an acceleration on 9.8% in 1999. All expenditure  categories  recorded  strong  growth.  Private consumption expanded rapidly as a combined consequence of high employment and  earnings  growth, wealth  effects,  the  current  programme  of  tax  cuts  and negative  real  interest  rates.  Investment  in  equipment continued   to   rise   strongly   as   did   output   in   the construction  sector,   in   response   to   buoyant   housing demand  and  public  expenditure  on  infrastructure  under the  National  Development  Plan.  Finally,  net  exports benefited  both  from  a  gain  in  competitiveness  (as  the weakness  of  the  euro  stimulated  exports  to  non-euro area  countries,  especially  to  the  UK  and  the  US)  and rapidgrowthinIreland'smarkets Growth outlook . While demand conditions continued to evolve  favourably,  the  available  evidence  suggests  that the  pace  of  growth  slowed  in  the  latter  half  of  2000, mainly    reflecting    labour    constraints    (see    below). Capacity constraints are expected to continue to be felt in  the  remainder  of  the  forecast  period.  At  the  same time,  however,  some  shocks  reduce  demand  in  2001, such as the worse US outlook, the weak performance of the  ICT  sector  and  restrictions  to  prevent  and  contain foot-and-mouth  disease.  Moreover,  given  a  very  high degree of trade openness, the scale of FDI inflows from the  US,  the  strong  presence  of  ICT  multinationals  and the  importance  of  the  agricultural  and  tourism  sectors, the  Irish  economy  is  more  exposed  to  these  adverse developments  than  its  EU  partners.  However,  with  the assumptions regarding the US economy presented above and  the  added  assumption  that  foot-and-mouth  actual outbreaks will be limited, the Irish economy is expected to  withstand  this  temporary  weakening  of  external  and domestic demand quite well. In particular, a strong pick- up in economic activity is forecast from the second half of  2001,  with  robust  consumer  confidence  owing  to strong   earnings   growth   in   a   near   full-employment economy, wealth effects and further tax relief. External  sector .  For  the  first  time  in  a  decade,  the current  account  is  expected  to  have  posted  a  deficit  in 2000, which will persist and increase over the rest of the forecast period. Apart from the effect of higher oil prices on   the   trade   balance   in   2000,   this   reflects   the expectation   that,   in   contrast   to   previous   years,   the growing trade surplus will no longer be strong enough to offset   the   steadily   increasing   deficits   on   both   the services  balance  and  the  balance  of  primary  incomes. The relatively big drop in 2001 is partly caused by the foot-and-mouth induced reduction in exports of foodstuffs and tourism services. Employment and labour supply . After record employment growth rates of 7.4% in 1998 and 6.3% in 1999, numbers employed grew by a lower, but still very high,  4.7%  in  2000  with  increasing  reports  of  labour shortages across the skill spectrum. With an unemployment rate of only 4.2% in 2000, the scope for further reductions in unemployment is clearly limited. The  contribution  of  other  sources  of  labour  supply  is also  likely  to  decline.  More  specifically,  the  natural demographic  increase  will  moderate  over  the  forecast period, inward migration will be discouraged by factors such   as   rising   accommodation   costs   and   increasing congestion  and   the   available   evidence   suggests   that further gains in participation rates will be fairly limited. The   forecast   assumes   that   employment   growth   will gradually slow to 2.4% in 2002. Productivity growth of 5.6% in 2000 is projected to decline to a still high rate of 4.6% in 2002. Wage  developments. Available  data  for  2000  suggest that  there  was  considerable  wage  drift  over  and  above the 5.5% basic pay rise negotiated in the national wage agreement   under   the   Programme   for   Prosperity   and Fairness  (PPF).  This  drift  resulted  from  demands  for compensation  for  higher  than  expected  inflation  and from  increasing  labour  market  tightness.  These  factors also  led  to  a  re-negotiation  of  the  PPF  in  December 2000, which brought up the basic pay rise for 2001 from 5.5%   to   7.5%.   An   additional   lump-sum   payment equivalent to 1% of basic pay to be paid in April 2002 is also part of the new deal. Allowing for drift  above  the basic pay rise provisions in a tight labour market, growth in compensation per employee is projected to have been 7.9% in 2000, peaking at 9.8% in 2001 and slow to 8.8% in 2002. Inflationary   pressures. CPI   inflation   was   5.6%   on average in 2000, with a peak of 7.0% in November. The rapid  rise  in  inflation  -  CPI  inflation  was  just  1.6%  in 1999 - was partly due to factors such as the increases in tobacco duties in the December 1999 Budget, the rise in oil  prices  and  the  weakness  of  the  euro.  With  these factors  falling  out  of  the  index,  the  headline  inflation rate will ease over the forecast period, further aided by the  expected  recovery  of  the  euro  and  by  indirect  tax cuts  which  the  authorities  expect  to  shave  about  0.5 percentage  points  off  the  CPI  inflation  rate  in  2001. However, the upsurge of inflation in the course of 2000 also reflected domestically-generated inflation in evidence of growing demand/supply imbalances. Capacity    constraints    coupled    with    rapid    average earnings  growth  are  expected  to  add  to  inflationary pressures over the forecast period. All in all, the outlook is for a moderate decline in headline inflation rates from 2000 levels. Public finances . The state of the public finances remains healthy,  with  the  debt  ratio  declining  further  to  about 27% in 2002. After a surplus of 4.5% of GDP in 2000, the expansionary nature of the budget for 2001 results in declining but still high surpluses in 2001 and 2002. As yet, however, it is difficult to cost the new Exchequer- sponsored savings scheme (to start in May 2001) and the package   of   foot-and-mouth   disease   related   measures and, in the absence of offsetting measures, these factors may  well  bring  about  somewhat  lower  surplus  ratios than projected here.		
April/2001	Italy	Strong economic upswing in 2000 set to soften in 2001	2000 outcome. Economic growth stepped up sharply in 2000  yielding  the  best  performance  since  1995.  Real GDP growth rose to 2.9%, almost twice the rate of the previous year. As a result, the growth gap with the euro area narrowed further to 0.5 percentage points from 0.9 percentage points in 1999. The  main  ingredients  of  the  upswing  in  2000  were dynamic  export  growth,  stronger  than  expected  private consumption expenditure and robust gross fixed capital formation.  The  buoyant  export  performance  was  a  late reversal    of    the    strong    negative    impact of the international  crises  back  in  1997  and  1998,  when  the relatively large exposure to extra-EU markets resulted in a deterioration of the foreign balance. In 2000, thanks to a strong expansion in world trade and the weak euro, the foreign balance recovered, adding over half a percentage point  to  GDP  growth.  The  improvement  was  largely achieved   outside   the   EU,   contrasting   with   a   rather disappointing performance inside the Union. Exports of goods to Germany, the largest foreign market for Italian goods,   virtually   stalled   in   2000,   whereas   German imports  of  goods  increased  by  more  than  11%.  Core inflation  persistently  higher  than  the  euro  area  average may be partly responsible. Private   consumption   expenditure,   the   second   major contributor  to  the  economic  upswing  in  2000,  revived markedly,    mainly    thanks    to    buoyant    employment creation and  a  dynamic  durable  goods  component.  The revival of private    consumption    expenditure    was particularly strong in the first half of the year, followed by a slowdown in the last two quarters of 2000 when the negative terms of trade effect of high energy prices and the weak euro seems to have taken its toll. The  labour  market  posted  a  major  improvement  with employment increasing by 1.9% and the unemployment rate falling to well below 11%. The improvement largely reflects greater labour market flexibility from the wider use of new labour contracts for part-time and temporary employment. The more flexible contracts accounted for more   than   three-fifths   of   the   employment   increase between    October    1999    and    October    2000,    with temporary contracts being particularly prominent. Sustained high energy prices and the depreciation of the euro were the main culprits of the rise in HICP inflation, which on an annual basis accelerated to 2.6%. Domestic inflationary pressures remained subdued, thanks to wage moderation and productivity growth. Outlook . The economic slowdown outside the EU in the second  half  of  2000,  especially  in  the  US,  has  already affected order books and expectations of manufacturing firms. This points to a loss of momentum on the external side  in  the  first  half  of  2001.  With  a  relatively  high sensitivity   of   exports   to   changes   in   the   external environment and a weak performance of exports within the  EU,  both  weaker  world  trade  and  higher  relative export  prices  are  expected  to  weigh  on  GDP  growth. The contribution of net exports to growth is forecast to turn    negative    in    2001,    leading    to    a    temporary deceleration in the overall pace of economic expansion. A projected recovery in exports in 2002 will, however, be offset in terms of the external contribution to growth by rising imports. In  2001  domestic  demand  will  also  contribute  to  the export-led slowdown in GDP growth. Private consumption  expenditure  should  turn  out  less  dynamic than in 2000 despite the expansionary impact of the tax cuts  included  in  the  Financial  Law  for  2001.  Firstly, expenditure on durable goods is projected to react from the   hefty   build-up   in   2000.   Secondly,   employment creation  is  forecast  to  ease  slightly  as  the  catching-up effect  prompted  by  the  introduction  of  more  flexible labour   contracts   in   1998   starts   to   peter   out.   The slowdown of fixed capital formation towards the end of 2000  is  expected  to  extend  into  the  first  half  of  2001 before  picking up  again  in  the  second  half.  Investment growth  is  expected  to  be  sustained  in  2002  and  be  the main force of the increase in domestic demand. Despite the  domestic  and  external  slowdown  compared  with 2000,  real  GDP  growth  should  remain  well  above  the weak rates observed over the nineties. After   its   oil-price-led   acceleration   in   2000,   HICP headline  inflation  is  expected  to  slow  in  2001,  with domestic   inflationary   pressures   remaining   subdued. Wage inflation could quicken slightly due to high wage increases  in  the  public  sector,  but  overall  should  not jeopardise wage moderation. Rising domestic pressures by the end of 2002 could arrest any further slowdown of inflation. Public  finances .  General  government  net  borrowing  in 2000  was  0.3%  of  GDP.  Excluding  receipts  from  the October  2000  auction  of  UMTS  licences,  the  general government deficit ratio was 1.5% of GDP, lower than the previous year’s outcome, but slightly higher than the target of 1.3%. Compared to 1999, the primary surplus, excluding the proceeds from the allocation of the UMTS licences,  remained  stable  at  5.0%  of  GDP  (including UMTS  proceeds,  it  increased  to  6.1%  of  GDP),  while interest payments decreased by 0.2 percentage points of GDP. For 2001, evaluation of the measures in the decree of 30 September 2000 and  the  Financial  Law for  2001 lead to a projected deficit ratio of around 1.3% of GDP, with the primary surplus deteriorating to 4.8% of GDP. The    full    implementation    of    the    tax    and    social contributions  cuts,  combined  with  substantially  lower receipts from the capital gains tax on investment funds compared to 2000, are estimated to entail a reduction in the  ratio  of  tax  and  contributions  receipts  of  about  0.6 percentage   points   of   GDP.   At   the   same   time,   the expenditure-curbing measures  in  the  Financial  Law are assumed  to  be  largely  effective  and  the  ratio  of  total primary  expenditure  is  expected  to  decrease  by  0.5 percentage  points  of  GDP  (the  comparison  excludes UMTS   proceeds).   The   ratio   of   gross   fixed   capital formation is expected to decline by 0.1 percentage point of  GDP.  This  reflects  not  only  the  assumption  that public investment may be lower than planned, as was the case in recent years, but also proceeds from the sale of state-owned  real  estate  being classified  under  this  item with a negative sign. Interest payments should continue to  decline  relative  to  GDP  to  an  estimated  ratio  of  6.2 percent. For 2002 the scenario takes into account further tax reductions and expenditure savings as set out in the Financial  Law  for  2001.  Moreover  it  is  assumed  that some investment expenditure planned for 2001 is shifted into 2002. A further reduction of the deficit to 1.0% of GDP is expected in the absence of corrective measures. The government debt ratio in 2000 fell to 110.2%, well below the initial objective of 111.7% of GDP. The debt ratio is expected to continue to decline over the forecast period.		
April/2001	Luxembourg	Activity remains strong, but is slowing	Growth . The Luxembourg economy has been performing  extremely  well  in  recent  years;  real  GDP growth was especially strong in 1999, reaching 7.5%. It was   even   stronger   in   2000,   at   8.5%,   according   to preliminary  estimates.  Real  GDP  growth  in  1999  was essentially driven by domestic demand, both government consumption and gross fixed capital formation registering  record  increases  due  chiefly  to  incidental factors. Exports of services proved remarkably dynamic, while  exports  of  goods  suffered  from the  slowdown  in international    trade.    Moreover,    imports    rose    fast, reflecting dynamism in  domestic  demand,  especially in equipment investment. In 2000, on the contrary, growth was essentially export- driven   :   exports   of   goods   fully  benefited   from  the acceleration  in  international  trade,  rising  by  more  than 9%  and  exports  of  services  proved  even  more  buoyant than  the  year  before,  increasing  by  about  17%  in  real terms.    On    the    contrary,    private    and    government consumption, though remaining dynamic, did not repeat the high growth rates recorded  in  1999  and  investment remained  roughly stagnant  :  investment  in  construction rose by more than 10% but investment in equipment fell by  about  8%  in  real  terms  after  the  record  increase registered  in  1999.  The  slowdown  in  investment  was reflected  in  a  relatively  modest  increase  in  imports  of goods (+6.1%, around half the 11.8% recorded in 1999). As  a  result,  the  contribution  of  external  trade  to  GDP growth,  which  had  been  significantly  negative  in  1999 turned widely positive in 2000, exports of services alone generating a 10% rise in real GDP. All  branches  contributed  to  the  strong  growth  of  the Luxembourg economy in 2000 but mostly transport and communications,  banking  and  insurance  as  well  as  the sector   of   services   to   enterprises,   which   accounted together for about 60% of total GDP growth. However, industry and construction performed well too, as shown by the strong rise in exports of goods and in construction investment. Real  GDP  growth  will  decelerate  slightly  in  2001  and 2002 but should remain strong, presumably between 5% and 6% : private consumption will benefit from the large tax  cuts  decided  by  the  Luxembourg  government  and should accelerate to annual growth rates around 4½% in both years. Government consumption will keep growing at a quite rapid pace while, after the pause observed in 2000, investment is expected to increase at rates closer to  its  long  term  trend.  Public  investment  should  prove very dynamic anyway, as the 2001 budget plans a 25.7% increase  in  value  in  investment  by  the  State.  While exports  of  services  will  probably  continue  to  benefit from   the   dynamism   of   the   financial,   transport   and communications  sectors,  exports  of  goods  should  slow down  from the  high  growth  rate  recorded  in  2000  but, with  a  still  dynamic  domestic  demand  in  neighbouring countries  and  a  rather  fast  growth  forecast  for  their imports, this slowdown should remain limited. Employment   and   unemployment. Strong   activity   in recent years resulted in a rapid increase in employment, which  rose  by  4.4%  in  1998,  by  5.0%  in  1999  and  by 5.5%   in   2000,   while   the   number   of   wage   earners increased   by   5.9%. Consequently,   unemployment continued to decline over the year, but stabilised in the last  months. Like  in  recent  years,  the  increase  in employment  mostly  resulted  from frontier  workers,  the number  of  which  rose  by  more  than  10%  a  year  since 1998   and   now   represents   about   30%   of   domestic employment. As   activity   is   expected   to   remain sustained  in  the  forecasting  period,  the  slowdown  in employment growth should be limited. Since unemployment is already at a very low level, the share of  frontier  workers  in  total  employment  should  keep rising as should the activity rate of residents. Wages  and  prices. In  such  a  context  of  strong  activity and  employment  growth,  wage  increases  significantly rose  last  year  :  while  average  compensation  per  head rose by 3.1% in 1999, it increased by about 5% in 2000, mostly as a result of the acceleration in consumer prices and of the automatic wage indexation mechanism.   The increase   in   consumer   prices   has   been   even   more pronounced, with the HICP rising by 3.8% over the year, while it had increased by only 1.0% in 1999.   Although this quickening partly reflects an increase in underlying inflation, it is also due for a large part to the very high share   of   petroleum   products   in   the    Luxembourg harmonised    price    which    also    takes    into    account expenditure   by   non-residents   on   the    Luxembourg territory and in particular their large purchases of petrol, alcohol and tobacco induced by the low level of excise duties. This   is   the   reason   why   the   Luxembourg statistical office now computes a national CPI excluding purchases  by  non-residents,  which  is  used  for  wage indexation  at  present;  its  increase  was  more  moderate, reaching  3.2%  in  2000.    The  rise  in  consumer  prices should  slow  significantly  in  2001  and  2002,  as  the effects  of  the  hike  in  oil  prices  observed  in  2000  will gradually  fade  away.  If  this   slowdown   materialises, some  moderation  in  wage  increases  to  around  4½%  in 2001 and 3¾% in 2002 may be expected. Public  finance s.  Strong  economic  growth  in  2000  also resulted  in  a  rapid  increase  in  tax  and  Social  Security revenues, especially in  indirect  taxes,  which  have  been rising  by  more  than  10%  annually  over  recent  years. Despite a rather fast increase in expenditure, especially in government consumption and investment, the general government surplus rose from 3.2% of GDP in 1998 to 4.7% in 1999 and 5.3% in 2000. Large tax cuts, already planned  for  2001  and  2002,  as  well  as  a  reduction  in company  taxes  announced  for  2002  should  result  in  a decrease  in  the  government  surplus,  also  owing  to  the fact  that  increase  in  expenditure  is  expected  to  remain rather  strong. However,  large  government  surpluses should still be recorded, amounting to about 4% of GDP this  year  and  3%  in  2002. The  general  government gross  debt,  already  the  lowest  by  far  in  the  whole European Union slightly declined in percentage of GDP in  the  last  years,  from 6.4%  in  1998  to  5.3%  in  2000. This    downward    trend    should    continue    over    the forecasting period		
April/2001	Netherlands	Buoyant, though decelerating economic activity	Growth . The  Dutch  macroeconomic  performance  has been  outstanding  since  the  1993  recession,  real  GDP growing  by  at  least  3%  in  6  out  of  the  7  years  from 1994;   2000   was   no   exception   to   this   rule   since, according   to   preliminary   estimates,   growth   reached 3.9%.  However,  the  peak  of  the  cycle  is  now  clearly behind  us:  real  GDP  growth  reached  4½%  in  annual terms  in  the  first  half  of  2000,  and  slowed  to  slightly more  than  3%  in  the  second.  Like  in  previous  years, growth  was  supported  by  buoyant  private  consumption but,   in   contrast   with   1999,   exports   proved   also extremely dynamic. Private consumption was fuelled by the rapid increase in employment, by tax cuts  operated in recent years, by accelerating wage increases and also probably  by  the  rise  in  the  price  of  houses  and,  up  to 1999,  in  the  stock  exchange.  Exports  fully  benefited from the recovery in external trade and the depreciation of  the  Euro,  growing  probably  by  about  9%,  which would   represent   the   fastest   annual   increase   of   the decade.   The   contribution   of   external   trade   to   GDP growth, which had been slightly negative in 1999, turned significantly  positive  in  2000.  In  contrast,  investment proved   less   dynamic   than   expected   despite   a   rapid increase  in  non  residential  construction  :  total  GFCF rose by about 4 ¾% over the year but remained stagnant in the 3 rd and 4 th quarters. Real  GDP  growth  will  slow  somewhat  in  2001  and  in 2002. The main engine of growth in the Dutch economy will probably remain private consumption, buoyed by a very  solid  increase  in  households  disposable  income (about    10%  in  nominal  terms  and  6%  in  real  terms) amplified  by  the  reduction  in  income  taxes  and  social security  contributions  implemented  at  the  beginning  of this year. Investment growth should ease slightly further in 2001 in yearly average, as construction output is not expected  to  repeat  the  high  growth  rate  registered  in 2000, but also as a consequence of a very low overhang due to the disappointing growth rates of the second half of 2000. Exports should feel the effects of the slowdown in international trade forecast for 2001 and the impact of the  deterioration  of  competitiveness  in  recent  years, which will no longer be partially compensated, as it was in  2000,  by  the  depreciation  of  the  Euro.  However,  as domestic    demand    will    remain    dynamic    in    most neighbouring  countries,  Dutch  exports  the  composition of which, incidentally, makes them little sensitive to the cycle, are expected to decelerate moderately. Employment and unemployment . Employment increased by  about  3%  a  year  in  the  period  1997-1999.  In  2000, employment  growth  might  have  been  slightly  slower, around 2½%. Unemployment continued to fall, albeit at an  increasingly  slower  pace,  the  harmonised  Eurostat rate declining from 4.0% in 1998, on an annual average basis  to  3.3%  in  1999  and  2.8%  in  2000.  Employment growth is set to remain dynamic in  2001  and  2002  but will  probably  decelerate  further  as  a  result  of  slightly slower  GDP  growth  and  of  mounting  labour  shortages (the stock of unfilled vacancies has been higher than the number  of  registered  unemployed  since  the  summer  of 2000).   In   2001   and   2002   registered   unemployment should continue to decrease but at a much slower pace than  in  recent  years  as  it  is  now  certainly  close  to  a frictional   level.   Accordingly,   higher   employment   is expected to result essentially from a higher activity rate, which, despite climbing significantly in recent years, is still   relatively   low   in   international   terms.   A   large number of persons potentially available for work exists, especially among the more than 900 000 beneficiaries of the   disability   insurance   scheme   (about   5   times   the number  of  registered  unemployed),  whose  number  is increasing  again  despite  the  reforms  introduced  by  the Dutch authorities in this field in recent years. Prices   and   wages .   The   strong   growth   in   activity recorded    since    1994    and    the    resulting    fall in unemployment   have   been   reflected   in   a   significant quickening   of   wage   increases   since   1997,   which probably brought fifteen years of wage moderation to an end.   The   result   was   a   worsening   of   the   external competitiveness  of  the  Dutch  economy  following  the very large gains recorded in the 1980s and for most of the  1990s.  However,  this  adverse  trend  was  partially offset  in  recent  years  by  the  depreciation  of  the  euro, which  is  not  expected  to  persist  during  the  forecasting period. In light of growing labour market tensions, wage increases are not expected to slow significantly in 2001 and  2002,  even  though  some  restraint  in  wage  claims could perhaps be expected in response to the substantial increase  in  disposable  income  resulting  from  the  tax reform. Consumer price inflation remained rather moderate until 1999, taking into account several years of rapid growth and  a  sharp  fall  in  unemployment,  although    it  grew higher  than  in  neighbouring  countries,  where  it  was falling to an all-time low. However, inflation picked up in  2000  as  a  result  of  rising  import  prices,  the  CPI increasing  by  2.5%  and  the  HICP  by  2.3%.  An  even sharper  increase  - 4%  or  more -  is  forecast  for  2000 under  the  additional  impact  of  higher  indirect  taxes. Inflation  is  expected  to  remain  fairly  high  in  2002, although  it  will  probably be  lower  than  in  2001  as  the effects of the indirect tax hike will gradually fade away. Public finances . On the basis of strong real GDP growth the   higher   tax   revenues   and   lower   social   security expenditure which it engendered, the deficit of 0.6% of GDP initially forecast for 1999 turned into a surplus of 1%, the first since 1973, while the ratio of public debt to GDP fell to 63.2%. In 2000, the surplus reached 2.0% of GDP,  boosted  by  revenue  from  the   sale   of   UMTS licences equivalent to 0.7% of  GDP.  The  wide-ranging tax  reform  entered  into  force  on  1 January 2001  will lead  to  a  significant  decrease  in  revenues  from income tax  and  social  security  contributions  that  will  be  only partly    offset    by    the    increase    in    indirect    taxes. Accordingly,  the  general  government  surplus   should decline  to  about  ¾%  of  GDP  before  rising  again  to around    1½%    in    2002,    assuming    policy    remains unchanged  and  no  additional  tax  cuts  are  decided.  The government  debt  ratio  fell  by  more  than  7  percentage points of GDP in 2000, decreasing from 63.2% in 1999 to 56.1%. It  is expected to decline below 50% in 2002.		
April/2001	Austria	Favourable growth in the face of budgetary consolidation	Output growth . Economic activity during the forecasting period  is  influenced,  apart  from  factors  related  to  the external   side,   to   a   significant   extent   by   budgetary developments.  Budgetary  consolidation  will  not  only affect   private   households   and   enterprises   through various tax related measures but will also be reflected in lower   public   consumption.   Consequently,   domestic demand is expected to decelerate substantially in 2001. In addition, export growth is likely to see a slowdown, in step  with  the  economic  development  of  Austria’s  main trading  partners.  As  a  result,  output  growth  in  2001  is expected to come down to 2½ %, after more than 3 % in 2000. In 2002, domestic demand is expected to recover slightly, which should offset the projected further small decline in export growth, thereby keeping GDP growth in 2002 more or less steady. Demand components . After peaking in 2000, growth of private consumption is expected to slacken in the current year.  The  increase  in  households’  disposable  income will  be  squeezed  by  tax  related  measures  taking  effect on 1 January 2001, following a rise in excise duties  in June 2000. In addition, enterprises might partly pass on last year’s oil price rises to consumers, which would act to  further  dampen  households’  purchasing  power.  In 2002,  by  contrast,  households’  disposable  income  is expected   to   rise   more   strongly   helped   also   by   the introduction of a new childcare allowance (“Kindergeld”).   As   a   result,   private   consumption   is expected to pick up again in 2002. Public consumption is   projected   to   slow   down   substantially   over   the forecasting period, given the government’s consolidation plans.  Fiscal  restraint  is  also  expected  to  prolong  the slack  in  construction  investment,  particularly  in  2001 but also in 2002. While investment in equipment surged in 2000, it is expected to decelerate in 2001 as a result of the  slowdown  in  exports  in  combination  with  lower growth of domestic demand. Net exports grew strongly in 2000, thus contributing significantly to GDP growth. Exports  are  projected  to  decelerate,  but  with  import growth   also   declining,   the   external   balance   should continue to contribute strongly to economic expansion in 2001 and to a lesser extent in 2002. Prices. In 2000, inflation stepped up due mainly to the oil  price  hike.  However,  domestic  factors,  in  particular the increase in excise duties in June, contributed as well. While this domestic effect will continue to be felt in the first five months of 2001, the expected easing of import prices should dominate consumer price developments in 2001. Consumer price inflation is thus projected to fall in 2001 and - against the background of steady growth, broadly unchanged external conditions and the expected moderation  of  wages  increases  -  to  decline  somewhat further  in  2002.  The  budgetary  consolidation  measures introduced  in  2001  and  2002  should  have  little  direct effect on inflation. Wages .  Although  partly  recuperating  the  loss  in  last year's  purchasing  power  due  to  higher  than  expected inflation, wage agreements in the private sector for 2001 were not unduly high. Moreover, in the public sector, in view  of  the  increased  budgetary  consolidation  efforts, pay rises will be particularly moderate, both in 2001 and 2002.  Still,  with  wage  rises  in  2001  somewhat  higher than  last  year  and  labour  productivity  declining,  unit labour costs are projected to rise in 2001, but to decrease again   in   2002,   when   wage   growth   is   expected   to moderate.  As  a  result,  the  observed  improvement  in cost-competitiveness vis-à-vis Austria’s trading partners during recent years is likely to come only to a temporary halt in 2001. Labour market . In line with the outlook for production, employment  growth  is  expected  to  continue  over  the forecasting period, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in 2000. Labour supply is subject to various tendencies, partly  offsetting  each  other.  In  particular,  changes  in social security legislation, such as the restriction of free access  to  health  insurance  for  non-working  spouses  of gainfully employed persons, are expected to raise labour supply.  Moreover,  the  government  recently  adopted  a new  childcare  allowance  to  be  introduced  next  year, which would tend to decrease labour supply. Basically, the  new  childcare  allowance,  which  will  be  paid  to  a parent staying at home up to 3 years after the birth of a child,  widens  significantly  the  eligibility  criteria  for current  child  benefits  at  the  same  time  as  it  raises  the benefit level. However, since the allowance is subject to an own income limit, above which it would be gradually diminished, it is expected to encourage part-time work. This forecast assumes that, on balance, a rise in labour supply  will  partially  offset  the  effect  of  employment growth on unemployment. Current account . Data on a cash basis suggest a further fall of the current account deficit in 2000 to some 2.9% of GDP (1999: 2.6%), partly as a result of the negative terms of trade effect. The current account is expected to improve over the forecast period. In 2001, in particular, the deficit in the trade balance should fall substantially as   domestic   demand   slows   down   and   import   price pressures   ease.   In   recent   years,   the   Austrian   trade balance has benefited a lot from very dynamic exports to the EU agreement countries. Public  finances .  On  the  face  of  it,  general  government net  lending  in  2000  dropped  significantly  to  1.1  %  of GDP, from 2.1 % in 1999. However, taking into account one-off   revenues   worth   more   than   0.6   %   of   GDP (proceeds from the auctioning of UMTS licences, sale of real  estate)  and  the  fiscal  gains  stemming  from  strong output    growth    the    underlying    budgetary    position changed little. By contrast, the budget plans or 2001 and 2002 imply significant budgetary restraint. By 2002, the general government position is planned to be in balance. Consolidation  efforts  total  1  %  of  GDP  in  2001.  Tax increases  are  estimated  to  raise  revenues  by  0.9  %  of GDP  in  2001.  At  the  same  time  federal  spending  is projected to increase - despite savings from the reforms of  the  pension  system  and  the  public  administration  - mainly due to compensation payments related to World War II  and  higher  subsidies  to  the  national  railways company.   In   2002,   budgetary   consolidation   at   the federal  level  is  chiefly  brought  about  by  expenditure savings. In addition, regional governments are to achieve significant  savings  in  2001  and  2002.  Total  measures incorporated  in  this  forecast  amount  to  a  cumulative € 3.8 billion or 1.7 % of GDP over the period 2001-02. Since more than half of the overall consolidation stems from  the  revenue  side,  the  tax  burden  in  Austria  is projected  to  increase  by  almost  1  percentage  point  to 44½ % of GDP		
April/2001	Portugal	Growth slowdown to a more sustainable  pace	Output  in  2000 .  GDP  is  estimated  to  have  grown  by about 3¼ % in 2000. This is close to the rate registered in   1999,   with   a   lower   contribution   from   domestic demand being roughly offset by a stronger contribution from   net   exports.   Growth   of   private   consumption decelerated  from  some  4¾ %  in  1999  to  an  estimated 3 %. Investment growth also slowed from about 6½ % in 1999  to  some  5½ %,  reflecting  mainly  a  weakening  of residential construction and lower government investment   due   to   start-up   problems   with   the   new Community Support Framework. By contrast, investment   in   equipment   remained   robust.   Export growth   accelerated   strongly   during   the   year   thanks partly  to  the  depreciation  of  the  euro  but  also  because some  transitory  factors  such  as  supply  constraints  of  a large  car  manufacturer,  which  were  related  to  a  model change,   faded   out.   As   a   consequence,   growth   of merchandise exports picked up to almost 8 %, from 3 % in   1999.   With   imports   remaining   fairly   steady,   net exports improved markedly in the course of 2000. Outlook .  Output  growth  is  projected  to  slow  down  to some  2½ %  in  the  period  2001-02.  This  is  primarily  a result  of  a  further  slowing  of  domestic  demand  and explained  chiefly  by  private  sector  agents'  efforts  to redress  their  balance  sheets  following  the  sharp  rise  in their indebtedness over recent years. Private  consumption,  in  particular,  should  remain  on  a downward  trend,  attaining  a  rate  of  some  2 %,  as  the household  savings  rate  is  assumed  to  recover  from  the historically  low  level  reached  in  1999.  A  number  of factors account for the expected further deceleration in consumer   expenditure,   notably   the   weak   growth   of non-wage  income  due  to  higher  interest  expenditure,  a moderation  in  the  demand  for  durables  following  the rapid  expansion  in  recent  years  (demand  for  cars  is expected  to  remain  particularly  subdued  as  saturation effects  combine  with  tax  increases  for  certain  motor vehicles) and a slowdown in employment creation as the economy operates near full employment Total investment growth is also expected to continue to decelerate   to   a   rate   of   4¼ %,   although   with   some differences within  the  sector.  More  specifically,  on  the back of good export prospects coupled with a relatively high    rate    of    capacity    utilisation,    investment in equipment   is   likely   to   remain   robust.   Additionally, government  investment  is  expected  to  pick  up  in  the forecast period owing to a  normalisation  of  the  project take-up rate in the new Community Support Framework. By   contrast,   investment   in   residential   construction, which   represents   some   40%   of   total   investment,   is forecast to decelerate sharply in 2001-02, after its rapid expansion  during the  period  1996-1999.  Export  market growth is estimated to come down from 12½ % in 2000 to   about   9 %   on   average   in   the   forecast   period. Consequently,  growth  of  total  exports  is  projected  to decelerate to around 6½ %. The implied loss in market shares  reflects  the  continuation  of  past  years’  trend, though  somewhat  less  accentuated,  and  appears  to  be related to an ongoing deterioration in relative unit labour costs. However, as imports are projected to decelerate in step with domestic demand,  the  growth  contribution  of net  exports  will  further  improve  from  approximately -¾ pp. in 2000 to around -¼ pp. in the forecast period. External  balance. The  external  deficit,  as  measured  by the sum of the current and capital balances, increased to some  8¾ %  of  GDP  in  2000,  resulting  from  several factors. Specifically, the continued strength of domestic demand  and  the  deterioration  in  the  terms  of  trade weakened  the  merchandise  trade  balance.  In  addition, due  to  the  start-up  problems  with  the  new  Community Support Framework the surplus in the capital transactions  account  diminished  noticeably.  However, the situation in the trade balance started to improve from mid-year onwards, thanks partially to a strong recovery of  exports  which,  in  combination  with  the  expected strengthening  of  the  terms  of  trade  and  lower  import growth, should make for an appreciable improvement in the trade balance over the forecast period. Coupled with a normalisation of capital transfers this should lower the external deficit to some 7½ % of GDP in 2001-02. Prices. Consumer  price  inflation  has  accelerated  since March   2000   under   the   impact   of   strong   domestic demand, rising fuel prices, the depreciation of the euro and a sharp increase in food prices. The HICP increased by   2.8 %   in   2000,   up   from   2.2 %   in   1999.   The acceleration   of   the   year-on-year   inflation   rate   from 1.4 % in March 2000 to 4.9 % in February 2001 implies strong  carry-over  effects  for  2001,  and  even  though year-on-year inflation is expected to decline markedly in the  course  of  the  year,  average  inflation  is  forecast  to rise to about 3½ % in 2001 before it falls back to some 2¼ % in 2002. Labour market. Employment grew by 1.7 % in 2000 and the unemployment rate fell to 4 %. Employment growth is  forecast  to  slow down  to  about  ¾ %  per  year  in  the 2001-02  period,  in  line  with  the  deceleration  in  output growth.    The    unemployment    rate,    although    rising moderately,    is    projected    to    remain    below    5 %. Continued   tightness   in   the   labour   market   will   put pressure   on   wage   settlements   in   the   private   sector. Overall,  wages  per  employee  are  projected  to  continue to rise by more than 5 % per year on average. Government  finances. The  general  government  deficit fell  from  2.0 %  of  GDP  in  1999  to  1.4 %  in  2000. However,  net  of  UMTS  proceeds  (worth  0.35 %  of GDP), the deficit ratio in 2000 was 1.7 %, slightly above the target of 1.5 %. The smaller than planned decline in the   deficit   was   due   to   a   rise   in   current   primary expenditure much above target which was only partially offset by lower capital expenditure. The deficit ratio is projected to attain 1½ % of GDP in 2001. This is above the  official  target  of  1.1 %  and  reflects  the  impact  of lower output growth as compared with the assumptions underlying  the  budget  plan.  For  2002,  the  government plans  important  tax  changes,  e.g.  in  the  area  of  energy and   property   taxes.   Moreover,   a   strengthening   of budgetary  procedures  in  the  framework  of  the  Public Finance   Consolidation   Programme   should   lead   to improved expenditure control. However, as the details of these reforms are still unknown, a projection applying a “no  policy  change”  assumption  leads  to  an  unchanged deficit of 1½ % of GDP in 2002.		
April/2001	Finland	Less  exports  make  growth  slow  from  a very high level	The  economy  in  2000. Following  the  slowdown  in  the summer half-year, domestic demand grew strongly in the fourth  quarter.  The  strength  of  domestic  demand  owed much to the  pick-up  of  private  consumption  in  the  last quarter,  which  in  spite  of  its  sluggishness  during  the preceding  two  quarters  posted  a  sturdy  annual  growth rate  of  3 %.  Against  a  background  of  high  rates  of capacity utilisation, investment rose by an annual  5  %, due mainly to the acceleration in equipment investment and non-residential construction. By contrast, growth of housing  investment  weakened  severely  to  some  2  %, down from a rate of more than 10 % in the year before, mainly  in  response  to  rising  interest  rates  and  high dwelling prices. Although  exports  slowed  somewhat  in  the  last  quarter, exceptionally high growth rates during the summer half- year propelled annual growth of merchandise exports to a whopping 20 %. Exports were buoyed by a very good price  competitiveness  of  Finnish  exporters  and  robust world  demand,  in  particular  for  electronics  -  notably telecommunications  equipment  -  and  metal  products. The high level of production in the manufacturing sector also   prompted   a   strong   rise   in   imports   of   goods. Nevertheless, the  external  balance  contributed  as  much as 3½ pp. to output growth in 2000, which is estimated at a strong 5.7 %. Following  the  good  performance  in  1999,  employment growth slowed somewhat in 2000 to an annual average of  1½  %.  Part-time  jobs  accounted  for  a  significant portion of overall employment expansion. This might be one   reason   for   the   rather   modest   decline   in   the unemployment  rate  by  0.4  pp.,  to  a  still  high  annual average  of  9.8%,  with  vacancies  being  primarily  filled by    persons    previously    outside    the    labour    force. Continued  structural  problems  in  the  labour  market, most  notably  skill  and  geographical  mismatch,  might have  been  another  factor  preventing  a  more  marked decline in unemployment. Prices accelerated rapidly in the course of 2000, easing only towards the very end of the year. Deflators of most domestic demand components came in at an annual rate of   over   3%.   The   worsening   inflation   performance reflected  mostly  external  factors  but  domestic  factors also   contributed.   In   particular,   the   increase   in   the national  CPI  was  aggravated  by  the  effect  of  higher interest rates for mortgage loans combined with the rise in other housing costs. Outlook for 2001 and 2002. Despite a clear deterioration of  both  consumer  and  business  confidence  towards  the end  of  2000,  output  should  continue   to   grow  at   a healthy, albeit decelerating pace in the near term. Private consumption is expected to pick up in line with the  increase  in  real  disposable  income  as  a  result  of sizeable income tax cuts in 2001 and, to a lesser extent, in 2002. After a drop in the savings rate in 2000 (in part due   to   some   statistical   peculiarities),   the   rate   of household saving is projected to rise again in 2001-02, remaining,  however,  below  the  level  reached  in  1999. Government    consumption    is    expected    to    remain subdued. Rapid population growth in some regions, due also to high levels of migration towards growth centres, is    expected    to    stimulate    residential construction investment,  although  shortages  of  skilled  labour  and construction land in some parts of the country are likely to  be  limiting factors  to  growth.  On  the  back of  sound profitability  business  investment  will  continue  to  grow at  a  fairly  brisk  pace  but  some  slowdown  is  likely  in 2002   owing   to   the   slackening   of   external   demand. Overall, thus, domestic demand is forecast to accelerate markedly in 2001 and to ease slightly in 2002. Regarding exports, the significant moderation in market growth  is  bound  to  translate  in  a  slowdown  of  export growth  to  more  normal  rates  despite  further  gains  in market  shares.  As  imports  are  likely  to  come  down  as well,  the  contribution  of  the  external  sector  to  output growth will remain firmly on the positive side, albeit at a much   reduced   level.   Indeed,   most   of   the   projected decline in output growth in 2001-2002 to around 4 % is due  to  the  reduced  growth  contribution  of  net  exports. These projections are based on a “soft landing” scenario for  the  telecommunications  equipment  sector.  To  the extent  that  overall  economic  developments  in  Finland are highly dependent on this sector, a different evolution of  the  latter  might  have  a  significant  impact  on  the Finnish economy at large. As a consequence, and given the   current   uncertainties   surrounding   the   near-term prospects of various high-tech segments of the economy, the risks to the forecast are substantial. Labour market. With overall labour productivity growth maintained at fairly high levels - albeit clearly reduced from the exceptional rate in 2000 - employment growth is  expected  to  decelerate  moderately  over  the  forecast period. Most of the job creation is expected in the more labour-intensive  services  sectors  and  in  construction. Employment in manufacturing should remain stable,  as strong  output  growth  will  be  mainly  achieved  through higher   productivity.   Unemployment   is   projected   to decline to clearly below 9% by 2002. Wages   and   prices .   A   centralised   two-years   wage agreement was concluded in December 2000. According to  the  agreement,  contractual  wages  will  increase  by 3.1%  in  2001  and  by  2.3%  in  2002.  Even  taking  into account a wage drift of  around  1  pp.,  this  outcome  for the  wage  negotiations  should  ensure  that  unit  labour costs develop moderately. In combination with lower oil prices  and  the  assumed  appreciation  of  the  euro  this should have some dampening effect on inflation. Government  finances. The  government's  multi-annual spending  guidelines  announced  in  March  2000  and  in March 2001 were aimed at ensuring the sound evolution of government finances in the medium term. Following this,  government  consumption  decreased  noticeably  in 2000.   However,   the   strong   rise   of   the   government surplus  to  6.7%  of  GDP  was  predominantly  revenue driven,   in   part   due   to   non-recurring   factors   (e.g. exceptional revenues from taxes on capital gains), while overall  expenditure  grew  broadly  in  line  with  budget plans.  In  2001,  in  the  absence  of  windfall  receipts, substantial  tax  cuts  are  expected  to  dampen  revenues from  income  taxes  significantly.  Indirect  tax  revenue should continue to grow in line with domestic demand. Overall,   robust   economic   growth,   tight   expenditure control  and  a  falling  interest  burden  from  continuing debt  redemption  should  keep  the  general  government surplus at fairly high levels of some 5½ % of GDP in the period   2001-02.   At   the   same   time,   both   tax   and expenditure  ratios  should  fall.  Government  debt  will continue  to  decrease,  although  at  a  somewhat  reduced pace		
April/2001	Denmark	Moderate  growth  rates  in  the  next  two years	Following  real  GDP  growth  of  close  to  3  per  cent  in 2000, boosted mainly by dynamic investment and robust growth in export markets, output expansion is expected to slow down in 2001. Whereas growth in both private and  government  consumption  is  projected  to  recover, this is likely to be more  than  offset  by a  much  weaker rise in investment. In 2002 economic growth is forecast to accelerate slightly, primarily as a result of a continued revival  of  private  consumption.  Given  that  the  Danish labour market is expected to remain very tight, relatively moderate growth rates are projected for 2001 and 2002. Economic  growth  in  2000. In  2000  real  GDP  grew  by 2.9  per  cent,  above  all  driven  by  strong  gross  fixed capital   formation   and   a   vital   external   demand.   In contrast, private consumption developed weakly and fell slightly last year, on the back of the fiscal retrenchment package and sluggish real disposable income. Car sales continued to plunge, by more than 22 per cent year-on- year.  The  large  drop  in  new car  registrations  is  caused by  reduced  tax  deductions  of  interest  payments,  high user costs and a relative saturation of the market. On the contrary,  investment  in  equipment  rose  vigorously  by some 16 per cent year-on-year. A favourable development of profits across most business sectors, an increasing   capacity   utilisation   in   the   manufacturing sector  and  a  sustained  tightness  of  the  labour  market were   factors   contributing   to   this   strong   investment surge.  Repair  works  after  the  storm in  December  1999 induced   a   strong   rise   also   in   housing   investment. Exports of goods and services expanded in tandem with the brisk rise in export markets and imports of goods and services  increased  substantially,  partially  linked  to  the high  import  intensity  of  equipment  investment  and  of exports.  Thus,  the  growth  contribution  of  net  exports ended up fairly weak at 0.2 per cent of GDP. Outlook for 2001 and 2002. Although, there has not yet been   any   indications   that   the   recovery   in   private consumption  has  begun,  private  consumption  should gradually  gain  strength  in  2001,  helped  by  rising  real take-home pay. Government consumption is forecast to expand by 2 per cent based on the final budget for 2001, which  entails  a  much  larger  increase  than  the  initial budget bill and the government’s target of limiting real growth   in   government   consumption   to   1   per   cent annually.   Investment   growth,   on   the   other   hand,   is expected  be  very slow in  the  current  year.  Gross  fixed capital  formation  in  the  construction  sector  is  even projected to fall as the impact of the repair works after the  1999  storm  fades  out.  Several  of  the  beneficial factors promoting equipment investment last year should remain  in  2001  and,  thus  the  level  of  investment  is expected  to  continue  to  be  high.  However,  the  growth rate  is  forecast  to  be  modest  in  2001.  Exports  are projected  to  grow  less  than  export  markets.  Although labour costs per person are expected to rise moderately, the  additional  four  days  of  paid  annual  leave  in  the private  sector  implemented  in  the  current  year  imply  a higher rise for labour costs per hour. Given that the rise in  equipment  investment  should  be  much  weaker  in 2001, growth in imports is assumed to return to a more “normal”  relationship  to  final  demand.  Net  exports  are thus  forecast  to  give  a  stronger  contribution  to  GDP growth than in 2000. In  2002  the  recovery  of  private  consumption  should continue as real disposable income is forecast to further improve.  Investment  should  increase  by moderate  rates and domestic demand growth is projected to strengthen in  comparison  to  2001.  Exports  of  goods  and  services are again expected to rise somewhat slower than export markets   and   imports   to   increase   in   line   with   final demand. Labour market. The Danish labour market continues to be very tight. Employment creation has lost some speed, but  it  still  rose  by  close  to  1  per  cent  in  2000  and  is forecast  to  continue  to  grow  by  some  0.5  per  cent  in both  the  current  and  the  coming  year.  Unemployment remained  fairly  stable  during  2000,  but  it  cannot  be excluded  that  this  was  linked  to  technical  difficulties with the active labour market policy measures and that the underlying trend was a slight fall. Unemployment is forecast to edge down slightly over 2001 and 2002 and the labour market is thus expected to remain very tight. Wages. Compensation  per  employee  per  head  rose  by 3.9   per   cent   in   2000,   but   the   corresponding   wage increase  per  hour  was  slightly  more  moderate  at  some 3.6  per  cent.  In  2001  wage  increases  per  employee  is forecast to decline to 3.6 per cent, mainly as employees are assumed to accept slightly lower wage increases as they will receive four additional days of holidays in the private  sector  (replacing  3  days  of  parental  leave).  In 2002 pay rises are projected to accelerate somewhat to 3.7 per cent. Prices. The  harmonised  inflation  rate  (HICP)  slowed somewhat towards the end of 2000 and reached 2.7 per cent  for  the  year  as  a  whole.  In  2001  inflation  is expected to fall back, facilitated by the appreciation  of the exchange rate at the end of 2000 and lower energy prices.  Thus,  inflation  is  expected  to  hover  slightly above 2 per cent both in 2001 and 2002. Public  finances. Danish  general  government  finances continue  to  show  solid  budget  surpluses  and  a  rapid reduction   of   the   gross   consolidated   debt,   which   is projected  to  decline  markedly  to  below  39  per  cent  of GDP  at  the  end  of  the  forecast  period.  A  cautious technical  assumption  of  the  proceeds  of  the  UMTS auction,  planned  to  take  place  in  autumn  of  this  year, raises the general government surplus by 0.2 per cent of GDP.		
April/2001	Sweden	Beyond the peak in the cycle	Output. The Swedish economy showed good growth in 2000 and real GDP rose by 3.6%.  Growth was sustained mostly  by  domestic  demand,  in  particular  high  private consumption. The external side developed favourably in 2000, and net exports contributed positively to growth. Growth of domestic demand was sustained by continued favourable  monetary  conditions.  The  Riksbank  raised the repo-rate by 25 basis points to 4% in December last year  and  has  since  left  it  unchanged,  as  inflationary pressures  are  expected  to  be  contained  this  year  and next. While economic growth has been solid since 1998, exceeding 3.5% in each year, there is still some potential for   higher   employment   and   productivity   growth   is expected  to  reach  2%  in  2002.  Thus,  the  supply  side should allow for respectable GDP growth, with inflation remaining within  the  Riksbank’s  inflation  target  of  2% (+/-  1  percentage  point).  However,  the  demand  side  is set  to  be  less  encouraging;  a  slowdown  of  growth  of export   markets   this   year   coincides   with   a   normal cyclical downturn of domestic demand and in particular of  private  consumption.  In  Q4-2000,  growth  slowed substantially, notably private consumption. The deceleration   was   fairly   broad-based,   although   some temporary  factors  influenced  the  results.  This  implies that the outlook for the Swedish economy is less positive in 2001 and 2002. Domestic demand growth is expected to  be  lower  in  2001  and  2002,  while  external  demand growth should slow this year but is expected to pickup in 2002, in line with world markets. GDP is expected to grow by 2.7% in 2001 and by 3.0% in 2002. GDP  components. Household  consumption  is  expected to grow moderately over the forecast period, largely due to   declining   consumer   confidence   following   a   long period  of  sustained  increases,  resulting  in  a  cyclical downturn  in  consumption,  not  least  of  durable  goods. Disposable income of households’ benefits from tax cuts in 2001 and some further employment growth. However, asset  prices  have  developed  sluggishly  and  result  in negative   wealth   effects,   which   is   likely   to   have contributed to the fall in consumer confidence observed since the end of last year. A reversal  of  the  downward trend  in  the  saving  rate  of  households  observed  since 1993  is  therefore  expected  in  2001  and  2002,  which results   in   lower   private   consumption   growth.   After modest growth in construction investment in 2000, this should increase strongly, particularly housing investment, in both 2001 and 2002, due to high demand for housing. Equipment investment was subdued in 2000 and   grew   by   3.9%.   Survey   results   point   to   higher investment growth in 2001 and the creation of the third generation communications network is also expected to result  in  higher  growth  in  2001.  The  latter  should  also help sustain relatively good growth in 2002, as there are indications  that  these  investments  should  take  place mostly  in  2002  and  2003.  In  the  second  half  of  2000, there  was  a  build-up  of  stocks,  partly  involuntarily. While  this  was  corrected  to  some  extent  in  industry towards the end of 2000, further destocking should take place in 2001. In 2000, exports accelerated to 9.8%, as demand for Swedish exports, in particular goods, among the  main  trading  partners  was  strong.  However,  the worsened global prospects in 2001 will result in weaker export  growth,  but  as  external  demand  improves  in 2002,  exports  are  set  to  accelerate  slightly.  The  very strong  performance  observed  in  the  telecom industries, which   have   contributed   significantly   to   exports,   is expected   to   weaken.   With   lower   domestic   demand growth,  in  particular  private  consumption,  imports  are also  expected  to  grow  more  slowly  over  the  forecast period. Price  developments. While  inflation  remained  low  in 2000,  averaging  1.3%  as  measured  by  both  the  HICP and the CPI, it increased in late 2000 and the CPI stood at  1.7%  in  January.  Even  though  the  labour  market  is fairly   tight   only   a   small   increase   in   inflationary pressures is expected to emerge and inflation could rise towards  2%  by  2002.  As  demand  growth  should  be weaker   in   2001   and   2002,   it   is   expected   that   the Riksbank will successfully fulfil its task in ensuring that the inflation target, of 2% +/- 1 percentage point, is not breached, without any further tightening of the monetary policy  stance.  The  strong  commitment  to  the  inflation target  has  probably  aided  the  continuation  of  wage moderation   in   industry,   as   evident   by   the   wage agreements  already  reached  early  this  year  for  three years  ahead.  In  this  framework,  wage  increases  should be  only  slightly  higher  over  the  forecast  period.  The result will be sustainable rises in unit wage costs. Labour market. Employment grew substantially by 2.2% during 2000 and unemployment fell to 6.3%. Continued employment growth is expected to be achieved, albeit at a  lower  pace.  The  number  of  unemployed  is  therefore expected to fall in 2001  and  further  in  2002,  when  the unemployment  rate  should  reach  5.4%.  Although  some sectors  appear  to  face  difficulties  in  recruiting  staff, there  are  no  signs  yet  of  widespread  labour  shortages. The  functioning  of  the  labour  market  seems  to  have improved in recent years, with moderate wage increases and    a    tendency    towards    a    closer    link    between productivity and wage growth at a decentralised level. In all, these factors, together with the credible fulfilment of the  inflation  target,  are  expected  to  result  in  further employment growth without resulting in highly inflationary wage increases over the forecast period. Government  finances. The  government  finances  have been in surplus since 1998 and continued large surpluses are   expected   in   2001   and   2002.   The   favourable economic   position   and   continued   adherence   to   the central government expenditure ceilings have contributed to the strong fiscal position. The credibility of the governments' ability not to breach the expenditure ceiling for central government is  now well  established. In  addition,  the  reduction  in  public  debt  is  expected  to contribute  to  lower  interest   payments.   In   2000,   the surplus in public finances was 4% of GDP and in 2001 and 2002  it  is  expected  to  be  3.9%  and  3.4%  of  GDP, respectively,  aided  by  the   favourable   labour   market which will moderate transfer payments to the household sector.  This  more  than  outweighs  the  effects  of  the lowering of taxes in 2001. Debt relative to GDP fell to below 60% of GDP in 2000, partly due to the use of the proceeds from the flotation of shares in Telia to reduce debt,  and  is  expected  to  fall  further,  to  below  50%  of GDP at the end of 2002, as the strong budget surpluses described above take effect		
April/2001	United Kingdom	Good growth with inflation remaining subdued	Output in   2000   rose   by   3%.   Growth   was   broadly sustained  by  especially  strong  household  consumption and  a  large  rise  in  exports  despite  sterling's  strength. (The latter were supported by good growth in the UK's overseas markets). These were partly offset by a weaker investment  performance  than  seen  in  recent  years  and rapidly rising imports; the latter driven by strong growth in  domestic  demand  and,  probably,  sterling’s  strength. Growth  slowed  down  to  0.4.%  quarter  on  quarter  in 2000 Q4 and 2.6% on the year due to slower growth of domestic demand. Some of this slowdown is attributable to   falls   in   output   resulting   from   adverse   weather conditions, disruptions to transport and a fall in oil and gas  extraction.  The  main  expenditure  components  of GDP  continued  to  grow  well.  The  labour  market  is strong with unemployment down to a little over 5% but with  wages  remaining  subdued.  Productivity,  having risen  slowly  for  a  long  period,  grew  by  2.6%  year  on year,  in  2000  Q3  following  2.9%  in  Q2.  Inflationary pressures  remain  very  weak  -  on  the  HICP  measure, inflation is under 1% and amongst the lowest in the EU. The  government's  target  measure  of  RPIX   inflation  is well under the 2.5% target. Forecast  output .  Despite  the  slowdown  in  2000  Q4, more timely data reveals a buoyant picture and growth is likely to pick up again. Retail sales volumes and export volumes have remained strong. Latest survey reports in both  manufacturing  and  services  suggest  good  growth and optimism, though, again, imports have risen rapidly. Looking  towards  2001  and  2002,  some  modest    slow down in growth is expected this year in response to the slowdown  in  the  US.  There  may  also  be  temporary reductions  in  output  as  a  result  of  direct  and  indirect effects  of  the  foot  and  mouth  outbreak.  However,  the fundamentals of continuing strong household consumption,    strong    government    consumption    and investment,  all  sustained  by  some  monetary  and  fiscal loosening  (in  the  budget),  as  well  as  export  growth should ensure that final demand remains strong over the forecast  period.  However,  the  contribution  of  exports will be weaker than originally expected. The expectation is that rising demand will be accommodated by rises in output with no big upsurge in inflation. While the labour market  is  tight,  a  modest  rise  in  the  employment  rate accompanied by respectable growth in labour productivity should ensure that GDP will grow at a little below 3% in 2001, rising to 3% growth in 2002 as the contribution  of  net  exports  to  growth  becomes  less negative.  Strong  growth  in  fixed  investment  in  recent years will also reduce problems of capacity constraints. Output    components .    Good    household    consumption growth is expected to be maintained in  2001 and 2002 as real earnings are expected to grow moderately and the labour   market   remains   strong.   There   is   also   some stimulus  from the  budget  measures.  Nevertheless  some slight  slow  down  is  expected  as  households  lift  the saving ratio from current low levels in the face of what are still high real interest rates and rebuild their position from what is expected to be a financial deficit in 2000. Recent weakness in the equity market and a cooling of the    housing    market    should    also    act    to    restrain consumption   a   little.   Export   growth   is   expected   to remain strong but slower than in 2000 as growth in UK markets, especially the US, slows but this will be offset partly   by   the   unwinding   of   the   adverse   effects   of sterling’s strength in recent years on exports. Government  consumption  and  investment  are  expected to    be    major    contributors    to    demand    growth    as established in the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review that details spending plans to 2003-04. Non-government  fixed  investment  is  expected  to  show slower growth than in recent years but this reflects  the absence  of  major  capacity  constraints  following  some years of very strong investment growth. Labour  Market .  The  labour  market  has  continued  to strengthen with unemployment hitting a twenty five year low recently. Its rate now stands at 5.2%. Employment is also growing well and rose by 1.2% in the year to Nov- Jan of 2001. Wage earnings are not a cause for concern especially   given   the   recent   respectable   productivity performance.    The    labour    market    is    expected    to strengthen  a  little  more  over  the  forecast  period.  Some small rise in the employment rate is expected as labour market  measures  such  as  the  ‘new  deal’  continue  to impact  but  the  fall  in  unemployment  to  2002  will  be much more modest than recent drops. Rather, the major supply  side  contributor  to  economic  growth,  will  be productivity  growth  in  excess  of  2%  a  year.  This  is  a little  higher  than  historical  experience  would  suggest. Nevertheless the rise is expected to be sustainable in the near term and accords with good rises in productivity in recent quarters. These may be associated with the strong boost  to  business  investment  in  recent  years  and,  in particular,  the  high  level  of  inward  direct  investment. Accordingly,  unit  labour  costs  rises  are  expected  to  be moderate and sustainable over the forecast period. External balance . The current account is projected to be in modest deficit rising of  around  2%  of  GDP  in  2001 and  2002.    This  is  not  thought  to  constitute  a  major imbalance. In particular, the negative contribution of net exports of goods and services to GDP growth in 2002 is expected to be less than in recent years. Prices . Inflation is very low on the HICP measure, and substantially below the RPIX 2.5% target. It is expected that  the  latter  will  continue  to  be  met.  Current  and expected benign developments of wage  inflation and in unit labour costs, may allow further monetary loosening. However,  the  inflation  rate  may  tick  up  a  little  as  the recent, strong, downward competitive pressure on retail margins  eases  and  the  effects  of  the   small,   recent, depreciation of sterling work through. Public  finances .  The  general  government  finances  are expected  to  remain  in  healthy  surplus  over  the  period. They  have  been,  and  will  continue  to  be,  buoyed  by strong   growth   in   revenues   associated   with   strong economic  growth.  This  will  be  partly  offset  by  the growth  in  planned  current  and  investment  expenditure, announced  recently.  Though  the  proceeds  of  sales  of UMTS  licences  boosted  the  finances  in  a  ‘one  off’ fashion in 2000, to yield a surplus of 4.3% of GDP, the resulting  reduction  in  debt  interest  will  also  make  a significant  contribution  to  government  surpluses of around  1%  of  GDP  in  both  2001  and  2002  despite  a mildly expansionary budget in March. Consequently, the ratio of gross debt to GDP will fall to well under 40% by the end of 2002		
November/2001	Belgium	Subdued growth in 2001 and slow recovery in 2002	The   economy   in   2001 .   The   Belgian   economy   has continued  to  slow  down,  following  a  trend  that  had already  started–albeit  more  gradually—in  the  second part  of  2000.  Real  GDP  growth  dropped  to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in Q1-2001. In the second quarter of 2001,  the  deterioration  in  GDP  was  substantial  with  a quarter-on-quarter   decline   of 0.5%.   The   prolonged weakness   in   foreign    demand    –    all    industrialised countries having experienced a similar and concomitant economic  deceleration  –  has  particularly  affected  the export performance of Belgium. In the first two quarters of  2001,  the  contribution  of  net  exports  to  quarterly GDP   growth   was   negative   by 0.8%   and   0.6% respectively. Export growth dropped to   -0.2% year-on- year in the second quarter of 2001 compared to 12.9% in the first quarter of 2000.   Higher-than-expected oil and food  prices  and,  more  recently,  the  dramatic  events  in the  USA  have  constituted  additional  negative  shocks. Private  consumption  has  been  negatively  affected  by rising inflation that peaked at 3.1% in May. In   the   first   quarter   of   2001,   investment   had   still performed  quite  well,  capacity  utilisation  rates  having reached  historically  high  levels  last  autumn.  However, investment collapsed in the second quarter of this year. Capacity  utilisation   rates   are   declining   and   demand perspectives   are   getting   gloomier   especially   in   the export  driven  and  thus  more  exposed  manufacturing sector. Prospects. Economic survey indicators are not positive. The  global  synthetic  indicator  of  the  National  Bank,  a leading  indicator  of  economic  activity,  is  at  its  lowest level   for the   last   six   years.   Consumer   confidence reached  negative  territory  even  before  the  US  tragedy. The  difficulties  already felt  by  the  airline  industry  and the  insurance  and  financial  sector  at  large  will  most probably undermine consumer confidence even more in the coming months. Real GDP growth is expected to average only   1.3% in 2001  and  will  start  to  recover  slowly  in  the  second quarter  of  2002  and  then  more  substantially  in  the second half of 2002.   Belgium being an open economy specialising  in  intermediary  products,  in  the  past  has demonstrated   that   it   often   slightly   anticipated   the general cycle.  This explains why recovery could start as early as the second quarter of 2002 even if some trading partners  will  probably  reach  the  trough  only  by  the middle  of  next  year.  The  statistical  overhang  weighs heavily on the annual real GDP growth rate that can be achieved  in  2002.  Thus  real  GDP  will  only  grow  by 1.3% in 2002.   In 2003, the rising trend should amplify and  bring  actual  growth  slightly  above  the  potential growth  rate.  Under  these  circumstances,  employment growth  will  be  low  in  2002  and  a  temporary  rise  in unemployment is forecast for 2002. Unemployment will resume its descending trend in 2003. GDP  components .  The  expected  lowering  of  inflation should  support  consumer  spending  in  2002.  However, the   expected   increase   in   unemployment   and   also precautionary   reflexes   should   lead   to   a   moderate increase  in  the  savings  rate  and  dampen  slightly  the positive  effect  of  lower  inflation.  Personal  income  tax cuts  in  2002  are  also  of  smaller  amplitude  than  in neighbouring    countries.    On    the    whole,    consumer spending  can  nevertheless  be  expected  to  remain  the driving   force   of   the   Belgian   economy.   In   2003, consumption should be much more sustained, employment  prospects  having  improved  and  tax  cuts allowing  households  to  dispose  of  a  higher  income Investment  is  expected  to  perform  poorly  in  2002  and should start to pick up only in the second half of 2002, due to low interest rates and better demand prospects. Net  exports  should  contribute  again  positively  to  real GDP growth in 2002 and 2003, in part due to improved terms  of  trade.  The  volume  in  exports  and  imports  is expected to increase at a moderate pace of around   2% in 2002 due to the slow growth of export markets in the world. Costs and prices. Consumer price inflation should hover around  2.4%  in  2001.  Temporary  shocks  (high  food prices  due  to  bad  weather  in  March,  foot-and  mouth disease) as well as high oil prices brought the CPI to a peak  in  May  2001.  With  a  cooling  off  in  economic activity, lower energy and food prices and a stabilisation in the Euro, price pressures should diminish. Next year, inflation is expected to fall to   1.4%, in part due  to  the  suppression  of  radio  and  television  taxes  in Flanders.   Nominal   unit   labour   costs   seem   to   be increasing  more  rapidly  than  in  the  three  neighbouring countries,  according  to  the  Central  Economic  Council. Strong  activity  and  an  exceptionally  high  employment growth  in  2000  have  contributed  to  this  situation.  But gloomier employment perspectives should help curb this negative impact on inflation and Belgium’s competitiveness. In 2003, inflation should remain stable also due to stronger price competition in the Euro area. Public finances .  After having reached their first surplus in  50  years  in  2000,  general  government  accounts  are expected to be near equilibrium in 2001 and this despite the slowing down of the economy. The government has been   strongly   defending   its   fiscal   stance   and   an extraordinary budget control exercise took place in July 2001.  For  2002,  Belgium  will  not  reach  the  budget surplus of 0.3%  of  GDP  foreseen  in  the  Stability Pact. The government is working in order to establish a 2002 budget in equilibrium, based on the assumption of 1.3% growth in GDP. Under a no change policy assumption, the  2002  general  government  accounts  would  show  a deficit of 0.5% of GDP. Gross public debt should reach 104%  of  GDP  in  2002  compared  to  a  101.4%  of  GDP target set in the Stability Programme.		
November/2001	Germany	Recovery postponed	Output in 2001. Economic developments since February have been clearly worse than projected in Spring. This is not least due to the fast deceleration in world and intra- EU trade, which dampened German export growth much beyond earlier expectations. This has also left  its  mark on  traditional  equipment  investment  which  is  expected to   decline   in   real   terms   in   2001.   Furthermore,   the decline  in  construction  investment  has  even  gained  in speed  and  is  projected  to  deduct  0.6  pp  (percentage points)  from  annual  GDP  growth.  The  rise  in  private consumption has also been clearly lower than could be expected in view of the important tax relief taking effect on  1  January 2001,  as  the  increase  in  energy  and  food prices drove consumer prices up by more than what was assumed   in   Spring.   Finally,   there   has   been   a   very important  de-stocking,  which  is  likely  to  deduct  some 0.8  pp.  from  the  overall  GDP  growth  in  2001.  Total output is estimated to grow by 0.7% in 2001. Short-term  growth  outlook. The  decline  in  production growth  is  projected  to  continue  in  coming  months,  not least because of the negative impact of the deceleration in  world  demand.  Given  the  relatively  high  share  of capital  goods  in  German  exports  and  the  decline  of foreign demand in this sector, which was already visible before   the   11   September,   a   deterioration   of   export growth  in  coming  months  appears  probable.  However, the  projected  2002  export  growth  figure  incorporates  a strong re-acceleration in the course of the year (due first of all to the assumed growth profile for the US). Private consumption is also projected to perform badly, as  the  ongoing  deterioration  in  employment  is  forecast to take its toll on households’ income. Furthermore, the introduction  and  fiscal  subsidisation  of  private  pension schemes from 1 January 2002 on in combination with a declining  level  of  consumer  confidence  does  not  make any  further  reduction  in  the  savings  ratio  plausible. Public    consumption    is expected to perform    as moderately   as   in   the   past   two   years.   Clearly,   the development  of  public  finances  in  2001  (see  below) does  not  offer  any  leeway  for  generous  expenditure programmes.   Furthermore,   the   ongoing   reduction   in government employment in combination with the saving measures that have been announced in the health sector should  contribute  to  put  a  lid  on  the  rise  in  public consumption. Equipment investment growth is forecast to improve in 2002, as negative  impact  of  the  change  in  depreciation rules   in   2001   runs   out   and   the   economic   outlook brightens.  By  contrast,  construction  investment  will  be held  back  by  the  strong  oversupply,  especially  in  the apartment sector, in the New Länder. It should, however, benefit  from  higher  rental  construction  in  the  southern part of the country and higher construction investments by enterprises. Stocks,   finally,   should   contribute   strongly   to   GDP growth  in  2002,  when  the  very  important  decline  in stocks observed in 2001 should be halted. Employment. In 2001, in spite of the projected very low growth rate for output, as a result of positive overhang effects  the  employment  figure  should  be  very  close  to that of 2000. In 2002, however, employment is forecast to  decline,  as  the  negative  overhang  will  more  than compensate for the projected rise in employment in the second half of 2002. The decline in employment will be predominantly concentrated in the manufacturing sector, while   the   expansion   of   the   workforce   in   the   non- manufacturing sector should continue, albeit at a slower pace. Annual average unemployment is expected to rise marginally above the mark of four million in 2002. With economic  activity projected  to  accelerate  clearly in  the course of 2002, employment should recover fast in 2003, bringing  unemployment  close  to  the  level  observed  in 2000. Inflation .    Due  to  the  combined  impact  of  the  rise  in energy   and   food   prices,   the   year-on-year   rise   in consumer  prices  reached  3.4%  in  May.  Since  then, supported primarily by the decline in energy prices and the appreciation of the euro, this rate has come down to 2.0% (October). For the year as a whole this implies a rise  in  the  national  and  harmonised  index  of  consumer prices  of  2.5%.  The  trend  decline  in  consumer  prices should be halted temporarily in January 2002 when the increase in the mineral oil tax (‘eco-tax’) and in tobacco and  insurance  taxes  should  add  at  least  0.6 p.p.  to  the monthly rise in consumer prices. However, assuming no major  changes  in  exchange  rates  and  petrol  prices,  the rise in consumer prices should fall clearly below 2% in the  course  of  next  year.  With  wage  negotiations  in Spring   2002   expected   to   result   in   moderate   wage agreements and assuming that exchange rates and petrol prices  remain  close  to  current  levels,  the  medium-term outlook for prices remains favourable. Public   Finance. With   economic   growth   strongly decelerating  in  the  course  of  2001,  tax  revenues  and public finances in general have performed clearly worse than  could  be  expected  at  the  beginning  of  the  year. Moreover,  as  a  consequence  of  higher  than  expected unemployment additional financing needs are piling up at   the   ‘Bundesanstalt   für   Arbeit’.   In   addition,   the abolition of expenditure ceilings for the drugs’ budget in the  health  sector  is  partially  responsible  for  the  high deficit in this sector, which is projected to reach at least  2  billion  (0.1%  of  GDP)  in  2001.  Finally,  there  is some   evidence   that   the   deficits   of   lower   levels   of government are developing worse than projected by the Spring   ‘Finanzplanungsrat’.   With   the   August   2001 statistical  revision  of  the  public  finance  figures  for  the past years now showing a structural deterioration in the general government deficit for 2000 by 0.3 pp., in 2001 the  borrowing  requirements  of  the  general  government sector are projected to reach 2.5% of GDP. As for 2002, in the light of the lower growth projections, the financial strains   in   the   pension   and   unemployment   insurance system  are  bound  to  grow  considerably  compared  to 2001 – barring a (clear) rise in contribution rates, which is  not  assumed  by  this  forecast.  An  increase  in  social security contribution rates in 2002 is to be expected in any case, as the deficit in the health sector is projected to be partially reduced by a rise in contribution rates. In 2003, in spite of the implementation of another step of the income tax reform the deficit is forecast to decline again  as  economic  growth  and  renewed  savings  efforts by the federal government should make themselves felt		
November/2001	Greece	Despite adverse external developments, sustained real GDP growth continues	Following successful stabilisation efforts undertaken for a  number  of  years,  macroeconomic  fundamentals  have improved  markedly  in  Greece  and  stability  has  been enforced  although  domestic  price  performance  remains vulnerable  particular  to  external  shocks.  In  real  terms, the catching-up process of the new Member of the euro zone, as from 1 January 2001, is accelerating. Despite an acceleration in exports, the external balance deteriorated in   2000,   as   most   of   the   expanding   components   of domestic demand, in particular investment in equipment and private consumption, have a strong import content. Real   GDP   growth   and   its   components. Real   GDP growth  has  been  above  the  EU  average  since  1996; economic activity accelerated further in 2000, rising by 4.3%.  As  total  investment  was  rising  much  faster  than total output, its relative share in real GDP reached 23% in  2000  from  18%  in  1995.  Tax  reforms  and  falling interest  rates  resulting  in  a  sharp  increase  in  consumer credit    are    supporting    private    consumption    which increased  strongly  in  2000  and  2001.  In  view  of  the preparation  for  the  Olympic  Games  of  2004  and  of accelerating  financial  flows  from  EU  Structural  funds, investment  growth  is  expected  to  rise  further  in  the period ahead, partly compensating for the slowdown in world demand; total investment is expected to approach 27%  of  GDP  in  2003.  Real  GDP  growth  is  forecast  to fall in 2002, rising by 3.5%, from an estimated 4.1% in 2001 and to return to rates above 4% afterwards in the aftermath of the recovery in world demand. Labour market . Despite buoyant economic activity,  the situation in the labour market improved only marginally until  2000.  After  peaking  to  almost  12%  in  1999,  the rate  of  unemployment  fell  to  11.1%  in  2000.  Total employment also fell by 0.3% in 2000, as the increase in employment in the services and the construction sectors could  not  compensate  for  continuing  job  losses  in  the manufacturing and the agricultural sectors. Employment is  estimated  to  increase  by  1.1%  in  2001  inducing  a further  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate.  Sustained activity and the continuation of structural reform efforts are expected to support an improvement in the situation of the labour market during the forecast period. Prices .  Throughout  2000,  developments  in  consumer prices were dominated by surging oil prices: the national index of consumer prices increased by an annual average of 3.2% in 2000 from 2.6% in 1999. Until the Summer months  of  2001,  there  was  no  clear  sign  of  inflation slowdown, while underlying trends were also a source of concern. In October 2001, the CPI rose by 2.8% (year- on-year)  from  3.6%  in  September.  Base  year  effects during    the    remainder    of    the    year    and    positive developments   in   underlying   indices,   particularly   in wholesale  prices,  are  expected  to  contribute  to  faster deceleration  in  consumer  prices,  estimated  to  average 3.4% in 2001. Inflation  is  expected  to  reach  around  3%  in  2002  and 2003;  the  forecast  is  influenced  by  assumptions  for primary commodities prices and oil prices which justify a deceleration in import prices in 2002. In addition, real wages were decelerating in 2000 reflecting a restrictive incomes policy in the public sector and moderate wage increases in the private sector implied by the May 2000 collective wage agreement, despite the incorporation of a compensation equal to 0.7% for the increase in prices in excess of projected inflation in 1999. Short-term wage pressures are limited by the conditions set down in the wage agreement and prospects for public sector incomes policy  as  announced  in  the  Greek  stability  programme and in the draft budget for 2002. In fact, the agreement provides no compensation for inflation until the end of 2001.   In   2002,   wage   increases   will   incorporate   an adjustment  aimed  at  ensuring  that  wage  increases  in 2001 equal the average inflation rate in 2001 plus 1%. However,  despite  a  temporary  deceleration,  economic activity   will   continue   to   be   strong;   in   addition, developments   in   unit   labour   costs   are   subject   to uncertainty, particularly with respect to the final year as a  new  wage  agreement  in  the  private  sector  should  be decided in the course of 2002. Public  finances .  Having  achieved  correction  of  severe fiscal  imbalances,  the  stance  of  fiscal  policy  seems  to have  turn  neutral.  The  general  government  deficit  was reduced to 1.1% of GDP in 2000 from 1.8% in 1999 and 1.2% set in the budget. The budget for 2001 targeted a surplus  of  0.5%  of  GDP  for  the  general  government; slower   than   expected   real   GDP   growth   and   higher inflation should result in both a shortfall in tax revenues and   an   overrun   in   primary   expenditure   which   are expected  to  be  partly  offset  by  proceeds  from  UMTS, amounting to  500 million in 2001 (or 0.4% of GDP). In the draft budget for 2002, the government is targeting a  surplus  of  1.3%  of  GDP,  marginally  lower  than  the target    of    1.5%    included    in    the    Greek    Stability Programme   presented   in   December   2000   under   the requirements  of  the  Stability  and  Growth  Pact.  In  fact, under  a  projection  of  much  slower  GDP  growth,  the government intends to implement current spending cuts; although this may be difficult to achieve given that the major   components   of   current   expenditure   (wages, interests   and   grants)   are   highly   inelastic,   a   smaller surplus may be reasonably forecast for 2002. Debt ratio . Rising primary surpluses, combined with the allocation of privatisation receipts to pay-off public debt resulted  in  reducing  the  debt  ratio  since  1996;  it  still reached a too high level in 2000, at 102.7% of GDP. The primary  surplus  is  expected  to  remain  high,  at  6.0% throughout the forecast period, contributing in maintaining the downward path in the debt ratio, which is  estimated  to  reach  99.8%  at  the  end  of  2001  and  to continue declining thereafter		
November/2001	Spain	Ongoing deceleration to be reversed in 2002	Output .   GDP  rose  strongly by 4.1%  in  both  1999  and 2000.    However,    economic    activity    has    weakened significantly in 2001, at first partly due to the negative impact from oil and unprocessed food price hikes earlier in the year and subsequently in response to the general international downturn. Domestic demand has moderated,  while  an  earlier  improving  trend   of   the external  sector  has  reversed.  GDP  growth  of  2.7%  in 2001  is  expected.  Domestic  demand  is  envisaged  to moderate further in 2002 while external demand should recover slightly. For 2002 as a whole, heavily influenced by  the  weakness  in  the  second  half  of  2001,  output growth is expected to be 2.0%, markedly lower than in 2001  but  with  a  recovery  gaining  strength  through  the year.  In  2003  growth  is  forecast  to  recover  to  3.2%, roughly in line with estimated potential. In 2001 economic growth has slowed with weakening of all  domestic  demand  components  and  exports.  Private consumption growth has moderated as a consequence of slower  job  creation  and  growth  of  disposable  income, while  worsening  expectations  have  caused  growth  of investment  in  equipment  to  fall  sharply;  in  addition, although  still  dynamic,  residential  construction  activity has moderated. As for the external demand, exports have slowed  down  markedly  as  the  international  setting  has become   less   favourable.   Despite   a   deceleration   of imports in line with domestic demand, the contribution from  the  net  external  demand  is  expected  to  remain negative. As a result, output growth is set to moderate to 2.7% with a particularly weak second half. The further fall of average growth in 2002 is based on more   moderate   growth   of   domestic   demand   and   a neutral  contribution  from  the  external  demand.  These are,   nevertheless,   whole-year   results,   and   cover   a significant   pick-up   during   the   year   to   above   trend growth by the end of the year. This recovery should take place  along  with  an  improvement  in  the  international setting. Annual  average  growth  of  private  consumption is   expected   to   continue   decelerating   due   to   slower employment and wage growth and to non-indexation of income tax brackets, resulting in a moderation in growth of households’ gross disposable income. In this context, the  saving  ratio  is  expected  to  increase  after  having reached  a  minimum  in  2000.  Growth  in  investment  in equipment   should   remain   moderate   given   the   still adverse macroeconomic scenario in the first half of the year,   while   residential   construction   should   show   a decelerating   trend   only   partially   offset   by   robust infrastructure  investment.  With  a  slowdown  in  import  growth   matched   on   the   side   of   exports   their   net contribution to output growth should be neutral. The pick-up in economic activity in 2003 is underpinned by    a    recovery    of    domestic    expenditure,    as    the contribution  from  the  net  external  demand  will  turn negative. Labour market .   Employment, as measured by full-time equivalent  jobs,  is  foreseen  to  rise  by  2.3%  in  2001 although  on  a  clearly  decelerating  path  in  line  with labour market indicators. In 2002, growth is expected to moderate  further  to  1.0%.  This  is  mainly  based  on  an expected deceleration of activity in more labour-intensive  branches,  especially  construction  and services, which have seen the more dynamic job creation in   the   recent   past.   In   2003,   employment   should accelerate   following   the   stronger   economic   growth. Despite less vigorous job growth and with little change in the activity rate, the unemployment rate continues to decrease during the forecast period. Prices . In   2001,   despite   relatively   moderate   wage growth,  price  developments  were  worse  than  expected due to high unprocessed food prices and a deterioration in core inflation during the first half of the year. HICP inflation for 2001 is forecast at 3.7% compared to 3.5% in the previous year. In 2002 inflation is expected to fall to 2.3%, based on deceleration of import prices, a better behaviour of food prices, and continued relatively mild wage growth implying moderating growth of unit labour costs.  In  2003  inflation  is  forecast  to  ease  further  to 2.1%. External sector .  The current account deficit is expected to narrow gradually during the forecasting period. This is  mainly  explained  by  an  improvement  in  the  visible terms of trade along with a growing services surplus. Public   finances . The   path   of   fiscal   consolidation followed  in  recent  years  has  continued  in  2001  based partly  on  the  strength  of  direct  taxes  (especially  social security contributions) and the  increase  in  UMTS  fees, and partly on control of current expenditure. The general government sector is expected to reach  a  small  surplus of 0.1% of GDP (compared to a deficit of 0.3% in 2000 and   to   an   official   target   for   2001   of   a   general government balance). For 2002 the general government balance is expected to record  a  small  deficit  (0.2%  of  GDP).  Several  factors contribute to avoid a bigger worsening. Firstly, income tax  brackets  will  not  be  revised  in  line  with  inflation while  VAT  and  excise  duties  on  some  items  will  be raised.   Secondly,   the   budgetary   impact   from   the indexation   of   pensions   is   expected   to   disappear   as inflation  would  be  close  to  2%  by  end  2002.  Finally, interest rates are assumed to remain moderate, reducing interest payments relative to GDP. These developments involving   either   higher   revenues   or   more   moderate expenditure  would  partially  counterbalance  the  impact on  social  benefits  from  the  2001  April  agreement  on wider social coverage and the increase in unemployment benefits. In 2003, under the assumption of no policy changes, the general government is forecast to reach a balance. Stemming    from   the    still    relatively    high    primary surpluses   envisaged   during   the   forecasting   period coupled  with  moderate  interest  rates,  the  debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to continue on a declining path. From 58% in 2001, the debt ratio is forecast to fall to 55.6% in 2003		
November/2001	France	Following   a   year   of   weakness,   economic activity should recover from Spring 2002	The economy in the first part of 2001 . The deceleration in economic activity in the first half of 2001 was more pronounced and lasting than expected last Spring. Real GDP  growth  slowed  to  an  annualised  1.4%,  as  against more   than   3%   in   the   second   half   of   2000.   This slowdown clearly reflects the direct impact of the global downturn,    through    the    trade    channel.    The    sharp slowdown in world trade led to a contraction in French exports  from  the  very  early  months  of  the  year.  Then, firms   reacted   rapidly   to   the   deterioration   in   global demand  expectations  and  to  lower  profits  by  adjusting the  level  of  inventories  (stock-building  contribution  to GDP growth was -0.9% in the first  quarter  2001).  In  a further    step,    firms    started    postponing    investment projects  and  diminishing  new  payrolls.  By  contrast, private consumption remained dynamic, increasing by a strong  annualised  3%  in  the  first  half  of  the  year, allowing  the  French  economy  to  avoid  an  even  more severe slowdown. Current   situation   and   prospects. Business   surveys suggest that the economic climate continued deteriorating  rapidly  in  the  last  few  months.  In  this context,  main  economic   indicators   are   still   oriented downwards,   in   particular   employment   and   private investment, firms adjusting their productive capacities to the  slowdown  in  production.  As  a  consequence,  GDP growth  is  expected  to  remain  sluggish  in  the  next  few quarters. From  next  Spring,  after  a  relatively  long  period  (five quarters) of weak GDP growth, activity in France should recover.  This  rebound  would  reflect  the  influence  of several factors. First, along with the recovery of the US economy, export markets growth for France is expected to  accelerate  gradually.  Second,  the  marked  decline  in inflation   expected   in   the   next   few   quarters   should bolster households’ purchasing power, and thus private consumption, which remains the mainstay of the current phase   of   expansion.   Finally,   monetary   and   fiscal stimulus   resulting   from   interest   rates   cuts   and   the cumulated  impact  from  tax  alleviation  and  increased spending should stimulate economic activity. GDP components . The deceleration in exports observed in the last few quarters should gradually come to an end. This  would  result  from  an  a acceleration  in  export markets  growth  of  the  French  economy  in  2002  and 2003, this effect compensating for the gradual fading of gains   in   competitiveness   associated   with   the   past depreciation of the euro. After  the  remarkable  dynamism of  the  last  three  years, private consumption should mark a temporary slowdown in the next few quarters. Real gross disposable income is expected  to  decelerate  due  to  a  pause  in  job  creations and moderation in wages resulting from the increase in the unemployment rate. From the Summer 2002, private consumption should resume and remain firm for the rest of   the   forecast   period.   This   acceleration   would   be favoured   by   a   decrease   in   inflation,   a   recovery   in employment and the implementation of tax cuts. After a year of stagnation, productive investment should gradually accelerate in the second part of 2002, pushed by   more   favourable   internal   and   external   demand prospects and a moderate cost of borrowing. Labour  market,  costs  and  prices. The  deterioration  in economic conditions started to impact the labour market in  Spring  2001:  employment  growth  slowed  markedly (from an annualised +3.5% in the first quarter of 2001 to below   2%   in    the    second)    and    the    fall    in    the unemployment rate came to an halt in March. In the next few   quarters,   such   developments   should   continue, employment growth becoming virtually zero despite the creation of numerous state-aided jobs. The unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  increase  until  next Spring.   In   this   context,   also   characterised   by   the implementation of working time reduction in small and medium companies, wage moderation should remain the rule.    From    next    Summer,    the    re-acceleration    in economic activity should allow a rebound in employment  growth  and  the  unemployment  rate  could then recover a downward orientation. Unit labour costs should not constitute a major threat to price  stability.  Indeed,  the  slight  acceleration  observed in  2001  should  be  short-lived.  The  labour  deepening phenomenon  observed  in  the  last  few  years  resulting from past policies (cuts in social contributions, “emplois jeunes”,   reduction   in   working   time)   is   expected   to vanish   gradually.   Labour   productivity   should   then accelerate  over  the  next  two  years  compared  to  the levels  observed  in  the  recent  past.  As  a  consequence, unit labour costs should grow very moderately in 2002 and 2003. Against this background, underlying inflation should remain below 2% in 2002 and decrease in 2003. The  stabilisation  of  the  euro  and  the  normalisation  of energy and food prices should trigger a fall in the actual inflation rate from the beginning of 2002. Public  finances .  The  deterioration  of  macroeconomic prospects  affects  negatively  the  projections  for  public finances. As a consequence of the draft budget for 2002 and  the  corrective  budget  bill  for  2001,  the  French government   revised   significantly   its   projections   for public finances. After 1.4% of GDP in 2000, the deficit is now expected to reach 1.5% in 2001 and come back to 1.4%  in  2002.  The  target  set  in  the  2000  updated stability  programme  was  a  General  government  deficit of 0.6% of GDP in 2002 (under the assumption of a 3% GDP growth). The revision is due to the impact on tax revenues of lower-than-expected GDP growth and by an upward revision to the objective for real expenditures in 2002. The   Commission   forecasts   the   general   government deficit  - excluding  revenues  from  UMTS  licences -  at 1.6% in 2001 and 2.0% of GDP in 2002. The forecast is based on the assumption that the real expenditure target for   2001   and   2002   will   be   respected,   and   on   the assumption  of  unchanged  policy.  This  assumption  is crucial when considering the risks on expenditures in the health  sector,  which  have  regularly  overshot  the  pre- fixed target in recent years, the change in unemployment benefit    rules    and    the    cost    associated    with    the implementation of working time reduction in the public sector.  The  forecast  takes  into  account  the  recently announced counter-cyclical   fiscal   plan worth   0.1 percentage  point  of  GDP.  Given  the  one-off  nature  of the measures of the plan, the deficit for 2002 and 2003 is not affected. In   2003,   the   improvement   in   economic   conditions should allow a  reduction  in  general  government  deficit to 1.6% of GDP, under the assumption that the objective for  expenditures  set  in  the  2000  update  of  the  stability programme will be met.		
November/2001	Ireland	A  sharp  slowdown,  but  towards  medium- term sustainable growth by 2003	Output in 2001 . Provisional national accounts for 2000 show  record  real  GDP  growth  of  11.5%,  with  a  rapid pace  of  expansion  of  12.1%  year-on-year  in  the  final quarter.  Provisional  quarterly  accounts  reveal  annual GDP growth of 13.2% in the first quarter of 2001, from a   very   low   base.   Nonetheless,   activity   has   slowed significantly  in  2001  under  the  combined  influence  of supply   constraints,   especially   labour   shortages,   and several   exogenous   shocks.   From   March    onwards, restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of foot and mouth  disease  not  only  hit  agriculture  but  hampered overall activity, in particular in the tourism industry. The economy also suffered under the international slowdown, although moderated by the later slowdown of European markets, the destination for a significant part of exports. Finally, the world-wide retrenchment in  the ICT   sector   added   to   the   overall   easing.   While   the projected growth rate for year 2001 of 6.5% still looks impressive,    it    should    be    stressed    that    this    rate incorporates little intra-year growth. Demand components in 2001 . The fundamental determinants  of  private  consumption  have  been  high growth in earnings per capita, significant direct tax relief and a healthy rise in employment. Nonetheless, the pace of  private  consumption  growth  witnessed  in  2000  is unlikely  to   have   been   sustained,   because   of   falling confidence levels and a "normalisation" in car sales after last year's record figures. The forecast therefore assumes a rise in the savings ratio in 2001 after the big drop in 2000. Investment in equipment is expected to rise more moderately  than  in  2000  in  view  of  lower  business confidence.  Housing  completions  in  the  private  sector are  expected  to  fall,  although  this  is  partly  offset  by  a rise  in  social  housing  construction.  By  contrast,  other construction  is  forecast  to  grow  strongly  as  a  result  of rising  public  expenditure  on  infrastructure  under  the National  Development  Plan.  Finally,  the  high  annual growth  rates  of  exports  and  imports  mask a  significant weakening  through  the  year,  given  the  international slowdown   and   some   loss   in   competitiveness   after several years of gains. Growth  outlook .  The  economy  is  expected  to  pick  up strongly from about the middle of 2002. Nevertheless, in the   absence   of   a   significant   carry-over   from   2001, annual  growth  will  be  far  below  potential  in  2002, entailing   a   rise   in   unemployment.   For   2003,   the projections  assume  that  the  economy  will  recover  to  a rate close to that commonly thought to be sustainable in the medium term, marking a distinct shift from a phase characterised by double-digit growth due to exceptional increases in the labour supply and productivity. External sector . The re-emergence of a current account deficit in 2000 after a decade of surpluses is explained by the fact that the growing trade surplus failed to fully offset   the   steadily   increasing   deficits   on   both   the services  balance  and  the  balance  of  primary  incomes. This trend is expected to persist over the forecast period, with the relatively big drop in 2001 partly caused by a reduction in exports of foodstuffs and tourism services. Labour market . The steady fall in unemployment since 1996  finally  came  to  a  halt  in  end-2000,  with  the  rate virtually flat in the year to October 2001  at  just  below 4%. The achievement of effectively full employment has been accompanied by growing shortages of both skilled and   unskilled   labour.   The   economic   slowdown   is expected  to  lead  to  employment  growth  temporarily below  labour  force  growth  in  2002,  even  though  the latter is on a downward trend. As a result, the forecast envisages  a  rise  in  the  unemployment  rate  in  2002  to around 4.5% and a similar level is projected for 2003. Wage  developments .  The  pay  clause  of  the  national agreement  2000-2002,  the Programme  for  Prosperity and Fairness (PPF), awards a 7.5% increase in basic pay in  2001.  The  available  evidence  suggests  that  earnings per  capita  are  rising  somewhat  faster  than  in  2000, although the subdued increase in income tax receipts to date casts some doubt on these indications. The forecast assumes  that  the  tight  labour  market  will  lead  to  some drift above the 2001 PPF provisions and that the rise in wages  per  capita  will  moderate  gradually  thereafter. This reflects the combination of a labour market that is still   largely   supply-determined   and   relatively   sticky wage   expectations,   although   wages   in   the   exposed sectors  of  the  economy  are  expected  to  respond  more flexibly to the economic downturn in order to safeguard competitiveness. Prices . The decline in HICP inflation in 2001, to 4.0% on average in the first ten months after 5.3% in calendar 2000, is partly due to a reversal of one-off factors which drove up inflation last year and partly to indirect tax cuts implemented  by  the  budget  for  2001.  However,  the upsurge of inflation, which became evident in the course of 2000, also reflected domestically-generated pressures and  these  are  expected  to  ease  only  gradually  over  the forecast period owing to the economic slowdown. As a result, inflation should ease while continuing to exceed theeuroareaaverage. Public finances . The state of the public finances remains healthy, with the debt ratio declining further to close to 25%  of  GDP  in  2003,  but  with  significantly  lower surpluses than the 4.5% of GDP seen in 2000. For 2001, a   large   tax   undershoot,   with   spending   broadly   as targeted,  is  expected  to  result  in  a  surplus  of  around 2.4%  of  GDP,  rather  than  4.3%  as  budgeted  (this  is exclusive  of  the  proceeds  of  the  tax  recovery  scheme running until 15 November). The projections for 2002- 03 are on an announced policy basis and do not reflect the budgetary measures for 2002 to be announced on 15 November  (spending)  and  5  December  (taxation  and welfare).  In  line  with  the  National  Development  Plan, capital  spending  will  rise  strongly  over  the  forecast period,  taking  general  government  fixed  investment  in nominal terms to 4.9% of GDP from 3.8% in 2000. The forecast  does  not  take  into  account  proceeds  from  the auction of UMTS licences.		
November/2001	Italy	Rebound  postponed  by  deterioration of global environment	Growth. The economic slowdown in 2001 has turned out steeper  than  expected,  with  real  GDP  stalling  in  the second quarter due to declining investment activity and weaker net exports. Thanks to the sound performance in the first  quarter,  with  real  GDP  increasing by 0.8%  on the  previous  three  months,  the  overhang  at  the  end  of June 2001 was still high at 1.8%. However, the chances of a recovery in the second half of this year, as signalled by  short-term  indicators   before   11   September,   have vanished in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the USA. Flagging prospects started materialising in the September  business  survey,  showing  a  marked  drop  in the  business  confidence  index.  By  contrast,  consumer confidence   held   up   surprisingly   well   in   October, offsetting the decline recorded a month earlier. Against    this    background,    Italian    GDP    growth    is projected  to  remain  weak  in  the  second  half  of  2001, averaging  1.8%  for  the  year  as  a  whole.  Nevertheless, compared to the euro area average, this would mark the end of a relatively long period  in  which  Italian  growth lagged  significantly  behind.  The  comparatively  better performance   in   the   current   downturn   can   be   partly explained   by   Italy’s   low   share   in   the   particularly troubled ITC sector and a relative recovery in its terms- of-trade. In 2002, the pace of economic expansion is forecast to remain  slow  at  first,  as  private  households  postpone major  purchases  and  firms  remain  cautious,  with  the uncertain outlook likely to outweigh the benefits of the tax   incentive   scheme   for   investment   approved   by Parliament   in   early   October   2001.   However,   with emerging   signs    of    the    assumed    global    recovery, domestic   demand   is   expected   to   pick-up   swiftly. Investment expenditure especially    is forecast to accelerate  as  firms  try  to  bring  forward  some  of  their investment plans to take advantage of the tax incentive scheme before its expiry at the end of the year. Private consumption  is  also  expected  to  strengthen,  reflecting regained  confidence.  Despite  the  assumed  recovery  in world  trade,  net  exports  are  expected  to  remain  weak. Import growth will be particularly strong due to the high import   content   of   investment,   while   the   assumed appreciation  of  the  real  effective  exchange  rate  will weigh on traditionally price sensitive Italian exports. For 2002  as  a  whole,  GDP  growth  is  forecast  to  average 1.3%. The upturn is assumed to weaken briefly in early 2003 as investment expenditure sags following the end of the tax  incentive  scheme.  Subsequently,  growth  is  forecast to firm again averaging at 2.7% for the year as a whole. Prices  and  Wages. After  peaking  at  an  annual  rate  of 3.0% in April 2001 in response to the oil and food price shocks, HICP inflation has continued to fall. It is set to weaken further, averaging 2.7% in 2001. The impact of the   price   shocks   on   headline   inflation   was   less pronounced than in the rest of the EU, with the positive differential  vis-à-vis  the  euro  area  disappearing  in  the first half of 2001. Core inflation, however, has remained above that of the euro area as a whole. With no further price shocks the inflation rate will fall below  2%  next  year.  In  the  second  half  of  2002  the expected economic recovery is likely to produce demand pressure  countered  by  lower  import  prices  and  wage moderation.  The  annual  average  is  expected  to  remain below 2% in both 2002 and 2003. Wage developments are forecast to remain conducive to low    inflation.    The    generous    public    sector    wage agreements  reached  in  2001  did  not  spill  over  to  the private  sector,  where  wage  moderation  is  expected  to continue. Employment and unemployment . While losing some   of   the   strong   momentum   recorded   last   year, employment growth held up surprisingly well in the first seven  months  of  2001,  with  the  rate  of  unemployment declining   to   9.4%   in   July.   Employment   growth   is expected  to  weaken  in  the  coming  quarters,  due  to  the economic slowdown, before picking up again later next year. This will lead to a temporary increase in the rate of unemployment.  However,  the  increase  is  forecast  to remain  modest  thanks  to  pro-cyclical  movement  of  the labour  force.  With  the  economic  recovery  firming  in 2003 the rate of unemployment is expected to fall below 9% at the end of the forecast horizon. Public finances . The general government net borrowing is estimated at 1.2% of GDP this year, at 1.2% in 2002 and  at  0.9%  in  2003.  The  government  debt  ratio  is expected to decline to around 108% of GDP in 2001 and to  continue  to  decline  over  the  forecast  period.  The forecast takes into account a series of provisions adopted in  recent  months  (in  particular,  the  agreement  between the government and the regions on healthcare expenditure,  the  decree  on  the  sale  of  publicly-owned real  estate  through  a  process  of  securitisation  and  the “first 100 days bill”, which contains measures to support investment  and  encourage  the  “surfacing”  of  the  black and grey economy). The forecast also encompasses  the result of a first examination of the draft budget for 2002. The draft budget introduces higher current expenditure, in   particular   for   pensions   and   public   sector   wages, increases family allowances, freezes the implementation of some of the tax reductions of last year’s budget and extends   the   voluntary   tax   on   the   re-evaluation   of company assets introduced last year. The  new  arrangements  for  the  sale  of  publicly-owned real-estate could  yield  revenues  of  up  to  1.3%  of  GDP over  the  forecast  period.  In  the  Commission  services’ forecast, the one-off impact of these sales on the budget is   cautiously assumed to be a cumulated 0.8% of GDP (0.1% of GDP in 2001, 0.3% in 2002 and 0.4% in 2003). While  the  real  estate  owned  by  the  social  security institutions   (an   estimated   0.6%   of   GDP)   is   well identified, at present no information is available on other property    which    the    government    intends    to    sell. Moreover, the process of establishing the new “vehicle company” in charge of the sales and of drawing up the list of saleable state-owned  property may be  somewhat lengthier   than   the   government   assumes.   As   for   the impact of the measures to encourage the surfacing of the underground economy, the Commission services estimate  the  effect  to  be  smaller  and  distributed  in  a different way over the forecast period than appears from the  technical  fiche  accompanying  the  “first  100  days bill”. As a result, the deficit is reduced by 0.3% of GDP in 2002 and 0.2% of GDP in 2003. In 2002 the impact is largely  due  to  the  one-off  effect  of  the  tax  and  social security  contributions  amnesty,  which  increases  capital revenues.  In  2003,  the  “emersion”  is  counted  only  in direct taxes and social security contributions		
November/2001	Luxembourg	reduced   activity   but   still   stronger than in neighbours	Growth. Luxembourg recorded from 1997 to 2000 four years of very strong growth but remained, however, not immune against the brutal slowdown that hit the whole EU   economy   and   signs   of   a   deceleration   can   be observed in  several  sectors  of  the  economy :  industrial output still grew strongly in the first quarter of the year but  declined  significantly  in  the  second. Activity  in construction  has  been  slowing  down  since  the  second part of last year but still remains rather high. Financial services    are    also    showing    signs    of    deceleration. However,   retail   trade   remained   buoyant   until   now, probably due  to  the  dynamism in  private  consumption, boosted   by   important   tax   cuts   implemented   at   the beginning of the year as well as strong job creation and acceleration in wage increases. Real  GDP  growth  should  nevertheless  remain  rather dynamic this year, at least in yearly average,  even  if  it will  certainly  decelerate  significantly  from  the  record growth rates recorded in the latest years. Strong growth in  2000  resulted  in  important  overhang  effects,  which should   amplify   the   change   rates   in   2001.   Private consumption will benefit from the effects of the cuts in income  tax  implemented  at  the  beginning  of  this  year and  from  favourable  developments  in  employment  (at least until now) even if most jobs created in recent years went  to  non-residents.  Government  consumption  will probably continue to increase rather fast, like in  recent years.   Gross   fixed   capital   formation   should   remain rather dynamic due for a part to the purchase of several aeroplanes  and  satellites  (which,  however,  being  fully imported have no direct effect on GDP growth). On the contrary,   exports,   especially   exports   of   goods   will undergo the effects of the generalised slowdown in the world   economy,   while   imports   should   remain   more dynamic,  chiefly  due  to  the  buoyancy  in  consumption and in investment in equipment. Despite the expected recovery in the first half of 2002, in  average,  real  GDP  growth  should  decelerate  further next  year  reflecting  mostly  an  unfavourable  overhang effect. Private consumption is likely to remain relatively dynamic  as  the  second  stage  of  the  cuts  in  personal income tax will be implemented. With slowing external demand and decreasing confidence in business, investment   should   not   repeat   the   results   that   will probably  be  recorded  this  year,  which,  were  partially due to incidental factors. Exports, especially exports of goods should decelerate further, as well  as  imports  but probably  to  a  lesser  extent,  due  to  a  still  dynamic internal  demand.  In  2003,  real  GDP  growth  should accelerate again, together with the expected recovery in international trade. Employment   and   unemployment Strong   growth   in economic activity in recent years resulted in a very fast increase in employment, which rose by more than 5% a year both in 1999 and in 2000. This strong job creation continued in the first part of this year and perhaps even in  the  third  quarter,  while  slowing  slightly  down  with respect to the previous years. This is probably the reason why   the   decline   in   the   unemployment   rate   slowed strongly  down  in  recent  months,  while  the  number  of unemployed,  which  had  been  continuously  declining since  the  beginning  of  1997,  stopped  decreasing  since the end of 2000 and began even to rise slightly again in recent  months.  Similarly,  part-time  unemployment  rose strongly since the beginning of this year. Employment  growth  should  decelerate  significantly  in the    coming    months,    reflecting    the    slowdown    in economic activity. As job creation in recent years mostly benefited to non residents, the slowdown in employment growth will probably chiefly result in a slower increase in  the  number  of  frontier  workers.  However,  it  should also lead to a rise in the number of resident unemployed even if a significant part of this increase is likely to be cushioned by the specific measures for the unemployed already  implemented  by  the  authorities.  Consequently, the rise in  registered  unemployment  might  well  remain more limited than could be a priori expected. Wages and prices . Inflation had significantly accelerated from  the  Autumn  of  1999;  it  followed  an  increase  in underlying  inflation  and  mostly  the  strong  rise  in  the price   of   oil   products,   the   share   of   which   in   the Luxembourg  harmonised  price  index  is  exceptionally large, due to the massive purchases of motor oil by non- residents  on  Grand-Duchy’s  territory.  The  increase  in the HICP amounted to 3.8% in yearly average in 2000, reaching  a  maximum  of  4.7%  in  July  and  remaining almost constantly above 4% until the end of the year. It significantly  slowed  down  since  the  beginning  of  this year,  falling to  2.4%  in  September,  but  this  favourable development is for a large part due to the decrease in oil prices,  as  underlying  inflation  has  been  continuously accelerating since the beginning of last year, from about 1.5% to 3% in recent months. However, inflation should continue  to  decelerate  during the  forecasting  period,  at least because some factors which explained the previous acceleration (rising oil prices, depreciation of the Euro) will disappear. Wage increases accelerated in the first part of this year, when the rise in total monthly labour cost amounted to 5.5% as against 4.9% in  2000.  This  evolution  is  partly due to the acceleration in inflation, which resulted in a new indexation  threshold  being  reached  in  April  2001, the  previous  one  having  occurred  in  July  2000.  As  a result  of  decelerating  inflation,  wages  increases  should slow   down   somewhat   in   2002   and   2003,   while remaining probably faster than in neighbouring countries. Public finance . General government balance has been in surplus  for  years  in  Luxembourg  and,  due  to  strong growth   which   boosted   public   revenues,   this   surplus reached  record  levels  in  1999  and  even  more  in  2000, despite the relatively fast increase in public expenditure. In  2002  and  probably even  more  in  2003,  this  surplus, while   remaining   substantial,   will   probably   decline significantly as a result of slower growth in activity and employment  and  the  ensuing  deceleration  in  revenues from taxes and social contributions but also of new cuts to be operated in personal income tax as well as in the corporate tax at the beginning of next year		
November/2001	Netherlands	Abrupt deceleration in economic activity	Output .   The   abrupt   slowdown   which   hit   the   EU economy was reinforced in the case of the Netherlands by  two  specific  factors  :  first,  households  anticipated much more than expected the rise in the standard VAT rate  from  17.5%  to  19%  which  entered  into  force  on 1 st January  2001  and,  consequently,  massively  bought durable   goods   in   the   last   months   of   2000:   private consumption  increased  by  0.8%  to  0.9%  (s.a.)  quarter- on-quarter  in  the  last  two  quarters  of  2000  but  fell  by 1.0%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2001.  This  anticipation phenomenon was widely expected but its magnitude was a surprise for most observers. In addition, the foot-and- mouth  epidemic  which  broke  out  at  the  end  of  March resulted  in  a  ban  on  Dutch  exports  of  meat  and  live animals   for   nearly  3   months,   which   intensified   the decline in Dutch exports of goods in the second quarter Apart from these incidental elements, more fundamental factors were also at work :as in neighbouring countries, exports were severely hit by the slowdown in the world economy. Gross fixed capital formation has decreased quarter-on- quarter from  the   beginning  of   2001,    despite strong growth   in   public   investment.   With   still   declining demand from abroad and plummeting producer confidence,  investment  is  not  likely  to  improve  before the  summer  of  2002  after  a  recovery  in  exports  and  a gradual  acceleration  in  private  consumption  may  have taken place. Contrarily  to  what  happened  in  previous  episodes  of slowdown  in  external  trade,  private  consumption  was rather subdued from the beginning of  2001,  mainly for the reason given above. It should recover progressively and become the main support to growth next year, taking into  account  the  fast  increase  in  wages  and  also  the effects of the tax reform which entered into force on 1 st January  2001  (households’  disposable  income  should rise by about 10% in nominal and 5% in real terms this year). However, consumption in 2002 will probably not reach the record growth rates registered over the period 1996-2000; already before 11 September, the worsening general   economic   situation   had   led   to   a   significant deterioration   in   consumers’   confidence,   which   will probably fall further in the coming months. Government  consumption  is  likely  to  provide  a  non negligible  support  to  growth  in  2001  and  2002:  it  will probably rise by about 3½% this year and still by around 2  ½%  next  year  as  a  result  of  additional  expenditure decided in two steps, in the Spring of this year and in the 2002  budget,  and  chiefly  concentrated  in  the  fields  of education, healthcare, internal security and environmental protection. Real GDP growth should thus not exceed 1½% in 2001 and will probably not speed up in yearly average terms in   2002,   as   the   expected   acceleration   in   private consumption  should  only  compensate  for  the  further slowdown in exports. Moreover, preliminary data for the 3d  quarter  released  on  November 15,  after  the  forecast was completed, were surprisingly bad, and might imply, if confirmed, a lower annual growth rate both for 2001 and 2002. In 2003, however, growth should recover and reach a rate around 3%, closer to the long-term trend. Employment and unemployment . Employment was very dynamic in recent years, rising by 2½% to 3% a year in the latest 5 years and still by 2.4% in 2000. It continued to grow rapidly in the first semester of 2001 but should slow significantly down in the second and even more in 2002,  with  a  new  acceleration  only  to  be  expected  in 2003  as  a  result  of  the  recovery  in  activity.  Registered unemployment   continued   to   decline   at   least   until summer of 2001, falling to levels unseen since the early 70’s (the  Eurostat  rate  stood  at  2.2%  (s.a.)  in  July and August).  However,  along  with  the  deceleration  in  jobs creation, it will probably begin to rise again in the later months  of  the  year.  It  should  continue  to  increase  in 2002 before stabilising and beginning to decline the year after, although, as a yearly average, it is likely to remain higher in 2003 than in 2002. Prices  and  wages . As  a  result  of  falling  registered unemployment  and  subsequent  increasing  tightness  in the  labour  market,  wages  accelerated  significantly  in recent years, from 1.3% growth in 1996 to about 5% in 2001, bringing 15 years of exemplary wage moderation to   an   end;   however,   the   ensuing   loss   of   external competitiveness was partially masked until 2000 by the depreciation   of   the   euro.   Wage   increases,   though slowing  down,  should  remain  rather  strong  in  coming years, as unemployment, though rising again, should still remain  at  low  levels  and  price  inflation  is  likely  to decelerate only progressively. CPI  inflation  remained  quite  moderate  by  historical standards until 1999 but began to accelerate in 2000 and particularly from the beginning of 2001, partly because of  the  rise  in  indirect  taxes  which  was  part  of  the  tax reform  implemented   on   1 st January   2001.   Both   the national CPI and the Eurostat harmonised index should increase  by  4½%  to  5%  in  2001.  Price  inflation  will probably slow down to between 2½% and 3% in 2002, as the effects of the rise in indirect taxes fade away, and more significantly in 2003. Public  finances . The  general  government  surplus  rose from  0.4%  in  1999  to  2.1%  of  GDP  in  2000  due  to strong economic growth but also to the proceeds of the auction of UMTS licences, which amounted to 0.7% of GDP.   A   wide   tax   reform   entered   into   force   on 1 January 2001,   leading  to   a   significant   decrease   in income tax and social security contributions, only partly offset  by  an  increase  in  indirect  taxes.  In  addition,  in spring,  the  government  used  the  room  for  manoeuvre created   by   decreasing   interest   payments   and   social transfers   for   the   additional   expenditure   mentioned above.  As  a  result,  the  surplus  should  decline  only moderately  in  2001  since  the  economic  slowdown  has not yet resulted in additional expenditure (unemployment  has  so  far  continued  to  decline),  while stronger  than  expected  increases  in  prices  and  nominal wages  partly  compensated  for  slower  real  growth  in private consumption. The 2002 budget foresees additional spending amounting to about 0.8% of GDP in the same domains as in 2001, as well as 0.3% of GDP new    tax    cuts,    directed    towards    households    and companies. As a result of these measures, but also due to the   slowdown   in   employment   and   in   inflation,   the general  government  surplus  should  decline  to  about 0.5%   of   GDP   in   2002   before   increasing   again   on unchanged policy to about 1.4% of GDP in 2003. Public debt will continue to decline and should fall below 50% of GDP, probably already in 2002		
November/2001	Austria	Government    deficit    improves    in    2001 despite low growth	Output growth . Economic activity during the forecasting period  is  influenced  by  the  strong  slowdown  in  world economic  growth  until  2002  and  a  dive  in  domestic demand,  expected  to  be  reversed  fully  only  in  2003. Budgetary consolidation is forecast  to  curb  private  and public   demand.   In   addition,   the   projected   slack   in investment  will  dampen  growth.  Export  expansion  is expected to slow down considerably due to international developments.  As  a  result,  output  growth  in  2001  is forecast to fall to some 1% after 3% in 2000. In 2002, domestic demand is expected to pick up somewhat, thus offsetting a further decline in export growth. As a result GDP growth should remain more or less steady. In 2003 the  projected  improvement  in  both  external  trade  and domestic demand should bring output expansion close to potential, i.e. some 2½%. Demand components . Growth of private consumption is expected  to  slacken  considerably in  2001.  Households’ purchasing power is being squeezed by tax measures and noticeably higher than anticipated inflation. In 2002, by contrast,    decelerating    price    increases    will    impact positively on households’ disposable income which will be   supported   also   by   a   new   childcare   allowance. However, a less benign employment outlook will partly offset  this  effect.  As  a  result,  private  consumption  is expected   to   pick   up   only   slightly   in   2002   before recovering more vigorously in 2003. Public consumption is  projected  to  fall  until  2002  as  a  result  of  budgetary consolidation,   before   expanding   very   moderately   in 2003. Influenced also by budgetary restraint, construction  investment  is  projected  to  plunge  in  2001 before   bottoming   out   towards   the   end   of   2002. Equipment    investment is expected    to    decelerate considerably in 2001 and 2002 owing to the slowdown in external and domestic demand. Exports are projected to  decelerate,  but  with  import  expansion  declining,  net exports  should  continue  to  contribute  strongly  to  GDP growth in 2001 and 2002. Prices. Oil  price  developments  and  increases  in  excise duties  in  June  2000  drove  up  prices  until  May  2001. Higher  housing  costs  also  added  to  price  pressures, resulting   in   core   inflation   converging   to   headline inflation.  In  2002,  by  contrast,  the  expected  easing  of import prices should dominate consumer price developments. Wages .  In  2001,  private  sector  wage  agreements  were fairly   moderate.   In   combination   with   higher   than expected inflation, a slight loss in real wages will result Labour unions will strive to recuperate part of this loss in  purchasing  power  in  2002,  although  the  cyclical downswing   should   impose   some   wage   moderation. Nominal  wage  settlements  for  2002  and  2003  are  thus assumed to be in the range of those for 2001, resulting in a slight increase in real wages. In the public sector, the agreed  pay-rise  for  2001  and  2002  is  moderate  but  a noticeable pick-up is expected for 2003. Labour  market .  The  slowdown  in  production  should curb  total  employment  growth.  Dependent  labour  is projected  to  expand  at  least  slightly  throughout  the forecasting  period  with  the  decline  in  self-employment continuing. The expansion in total employment will thus come  to  a  halt  in  2001  and  reverse  in  2002  before resuming  in  2003.  Labour  supply  is  subject  to  partly offsetting   tendencies   related   to   changes   in   social security   legislation   and   a   new   childcare   allowance. Unemployment  is  expected  to  rise  in  both  2001  and 2002 before falling again in 2003. Current account . The current account deficit is expected to  remain  steady in  2001  and  to  improve  in  2002.  The trade  deficit  should  decline  thanks  to  lower  imports reflecting weak domestic demand. In 2003, with import growth   picking   up,   the   current   account   deficit   is expected  to  rise  noticeably  despite  a  relatively  stable services surplus. Public  finances .  The  budgets  2001  and  2002  imply significant restraint despite a new childcare allowance to be introduced in 2002. In  2001,  revenues  so  far  have  turned  out  significantly higher   than   expected,   for   two   reasons:   First,   the revenue-based  consolidation  measures  yield  better  than anticipated  results  despite   the   slowdown   in   growth, suggesting that their budgetary effect was assessed very cautiously.  Second,  enterprises  increased  significantly their   quarterly   tax   pre-payments   as   a   result   of   the introduction  of  interest  charges  on  tax  arrears  as  of  1 October 2001. According  to  this  forecast’s  calculations,  revenue  side measures  at  the  federal  level  amount  to  some  1.8%  of GDP in 2001, significantly higher than estimated in the stability  programme.  In  addition,  higher  than  expected inflation  is  projected  to  offset  partly  the  impact  of  the slowdown  in  growth.  Hence,  the  deficit  for  2001  is estimated  to  fall  to  0.2%  of  GDP,  clearly  below  the stability   programme’s   target.   However,   given   that already  at  the  beginning  of  November  the  government announced  that  a  balanced  budget  will  be  attained  in 2001, it is likely that one-off measures will make up for any  divergence  from  a  balanced  budget.  Clearly,  this result is achieved at the expense of a significant increase in the tax burden, projected to rise by 1.7 p.p. to 45.6% of GDP. In  2002,  the  continued  effects  of  the  recent  pension reform  and  the  ongoing  administrative  reform  should more   than   offset   the   cost   of   the   new   childcare allowance. Although government spending in percent of GDP  should  thus  fall  significantly  (due  also  to  the absence   of   some   one-off   expenditure   in   2001),   the slowdown in output growth and some revenue shortfalls from unsettled tax claims linked to higher prepayments in 2001 are expected to raise the deficit slightly to 0.4% of GDP. While this projection deviates from the official target of a balanced budget, the divergence is, however, mainly   due   to   differences   in   the   assumptions   on economic   growth.   In   other   words,   the   underlying structural balance is expected to improve as planned. In 2003, the continued impact of structural expenditure reform  combined  with  the  recovery  of  output  growth should result in a small budgetary surplus. This forecast is based on a  no-policy-change  assumption,  taking into account only measures decided at  the  cut-off  date  (e.g. the  planned  reduction  in  non-wage  labour  cost  is  not included).		
November/2001	Portugal	Towards a more balanced growth pattern	The economy in 2001 . The pace of economic growth is estimated to decelerate from 3¼% during 1999-2000 to about  1¾ %  in  2001,  as  the  slowdown  in  the  growth contribution of domestic demand is only partly offset by an  improvement  of  exports.  In  particular,  growth  of private  consumption  has  seen  a  sharp  deceleration  and investment growth is expected to decline by about 1%, reflecting  a  weakening  in  residential  construction  and business   investment.   Public   investment,   by   contrast, picked  up   in   2001   partly  due   to   a   catch-up   effect following  problems  with  the  new  Community  Support Framework in 2000 and an investment cycle due to local elections. Export growth is estimated to slow down from 8% in 2000 to just over 6% in 2001, partly reflecting a decline  in  exports  market  growth.  At  the  same  time, weakening  domestic  demand  brought  about  a  strong deceleration in import growth from 6% in 2000 to about 2¾%  in  2001.  Consequently,  the  contribution  of  net exports to output growth improved by about 1% of GDP. Outlook .  Following  output  growth  of  0.8%  in  the  first half  of  the  year  2001,  the  forecast  assumes  a  slight deceleration  in  GDP  growth  in  the  second  half  of  the year,  bringing the annual growth rate in 2001 to around 1¾%. A pick-up in economic activity is expected from the first half of 2002 onwards, reflecting the assumption of   favourable   developments   in   the   world   economy. However, in view of the negative overhang from 2001, output  growth  is  expected  to  reach  only  1½%  in  2002 before reviving to an annual growth rate of some 2¼% in  2003.  Domestic  demand  is  forecast  to  grow  by  an annual  average  of  about  1¾%  in  2002-03,  i.e.  about ½ p.p.  below  the  EU  average.  This  is  mainly  due  to continued efforts of private sector agents to redress their balance   sheets,   following   the   sharp   rise   in   their indebtedness in recent years. Private  consumption  is  expected  to  remain  subdued throughout  the  forecast  period  as  consumer  confidence is  currently  low  and  the  households’  saving  rate  is assumed  to  rebound  from  the  historically  low  level reached in 1999. Moreover, the demand for durables is expected  to  fall  back  from  the  high  levels  reached  in 2000,    reflecting   some    saturation    effects    and    the slowdown in residential construction which is expected to  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  demand  for  domestic appliances. Total  investment  growth  is  projected  to  strengthen  to about  3%  on  average  in  the  forecast  period  after  a decline of about 1% in 2001. This acceleration reflects improved    prospects for export growth    and    the implementation    of    the    new    Community    Support Framework. Investment in equipment  is  expected  to  be fairly robust while construction should remain subdued as a consequence of the ongoing slowdown in residential construction  –  which  represents  some  40%  of  total investment   –   as   a   consequence   of   the   projected correction in households’ indebtedness levels. In 2001, export market growth is estimated to decelerate to   just   2½%   from   over   12%   in   2000.   This   sharp deceleration  in  external  demand  is  expected  to  affect negatively export growth in the second half of 2001 and into   2002.   As   export   market   growth   progressively gathers   pace   over   the   forecast   period,   total   export growth is projected to gain momentum. The total import elasticity of final demand is estimated to decline in 2001 and  in  the  first  half  of  2002,  because  of  the  marked slowdown  in  the  demand  for  durables,  which  have  a high   import   content.   With   the   gradual   revival   of investment  and  exports,  the  import  elasticity  should edge up again at the end of the forecast period. Overall, the  contribution  of  net  exports  to  output  growth  is forecast to be close to zero over the forecast period. External  balance. The  external  deficit,  as  measured  by the sum of the current and capital balances, is projected to decline from 8¼ % of GDP  in  2000  to  6%  in  2003. The  narrowing  of  the  external  imbalance  reflects  the slowdown in the growth of domestic demand combined with   the   expected   normalisation   in   capital   transfers resulting from the implementation of the new Community Support Framework. Prices. CPI  inflation  rose  from  2.5%  (yoy)  in  Q2  of 2000  to  4.8%  in  Q1  of  2001.  A  number  of  temporary factors contributed to this, such as the oil price hike, bad weather  conditions  and  the  BSE  scare,  but  demand pressures   also   played   a   role.   Since   Q2   of   2001 inflationary pressures  have  started  to  subside,  although the  inflation  rate  is  still  running  at  4%  yoy.  In  fact, underlying   inflation    (CPI   excluding   non-processed foodstuff)   has   risen   above   3½%   since   early   2001. Inflation is projected to continue to decelerate in Q4 of 2001, reaching an annual average rate of 4¼%. Inflation is  forecast  to  pursue  its  deceleration  over  the  forecast period,  attaining  a  value  of  just  over  2%  in  2003, reflecting  a  better  outlook  for  import  prices,  the  slight appreciation of the euro and lower demand pressures. Labour  market. Employment  is  estimated  to  grow  by about 1½ % in 2001. However, due to a concomitant rise in the labour force,  the  unemployment  rate  is  expected to remain unchanged at about 4 %. Employment growth is  forecast  to  slow down  to  about  ¾ %  per  year  in  the forecast   period,   whereas   the   unemployment   rate   is expected  to  rise  moderately  to  4½%  by  2003.  Despite the continuing tightness in the labour market, wages per head are projected to decelerate over the forecast period, from about 6½% in 2001 to some 4% in 2003, reflecting the  fall  in  inflation  and  favourable  knock-on  effects  in the  private  sector  stemming  from  the  assumed  wage moderation in the public sector. Government finances. In the first nine months of 2001, data on budgetary execution for the central government point to a  significant  shortfall  in  tax  revenue,  resulting both  from  the  slowdown  in  growth  and  discretionary measures  taken  in  the  2001  tax  reform.  However,  no significant  overrun  in  primary  current  expenditure  is expected, due to the approval of a supplementary budget in  June  introducing  savings  of  about  0.7%  of  GDP. Overall,  the  general  government  deficit  is  estimated  to be  around  2%  of  GDP  in  2001.  The  2002  budget  law projects a general government deficit of 1.3%  in  2002. However,  this  is  based  on  the  assumption  of  output growth  of  2%.  Moreover,  the  2002  budget  proposal assumes significant additional gains in the efficiency of tax  collection,  which  might  prove  too  optimistic  given that  tax  elasticities  tend  to  fall  during  an  economic slowdown.   All   considered,   the   general   government deficit is forecast at 1.6% of GDP in 2002.		
November/2001	Finland	Sharp slowdown due to tumbling exports	The  economy  in  2001. The  Finnish  economy  slowed down   sharply   at   the   beginning   of   2001.   Exports decelerated  already  from  the  last  quarter  of  2000,  due basically  to  the  world-wide  decline  of  the  ICT  and forestry   sectors.   Following   the   decrease   in   output growth  domestic  demand  also  eased  strongly  towards summer.  In  spite  of  a  strong  expansion  of  household earnings,  due  also  to  sizeable  income  tax  cuts,  private consumption  was  sluggish,  mainly  as  a  result  of  rising inflation.  In  addition,  investment  activity  was  subdued. In  particular,  housing  construction  moderated  strongly, while   other   construction   activity   remained   robust. Moreover,  expenditure  on  equipment  and  machinery investments   dropped   sharply   in   the   second   quarter following   the   sag   in   manufacturing.   An   inventory correction  added  to  the  slump  of  the  economy.  Only government consumption continued to hold up. Inflation measured by HICP prices peaked in May 2001 at  3.3%  reflecting  the  renewed  rise  of  energy  costs,  a hike in food prices and high prices of private services. In spite   of   the   rapid   slowing   of   activity,   employment growth  continued  to  be  solid  in  the  first  half  of  2001, reflecting  still  favourable  developments  in  the  service sector.  However,  with  the  labour  force  still  expanding, unemployment   has   been   virtually   unchanged   since spring. Since summer, both consumer’s and industrie’s sentiment surveys have continued to decline. Indicators of  retail  and  wholesale  trade  point  to  an  easing  in consumption expenditure of households. Private consumption  is  thus  expected  to  grow  by  only  1½%. Given  the  continued  increase  of  household  income  in combination  with  weak  spending  figures,  the  savings rate is expected to rise noticeably. With the contraction of   housing   investments   continuing   and   a   marked deceleration   in   the   investment   outlook,   gross   fixed capital formation will increase by about 1.8%. Although government  consumption  is  expected  to  be  sustained, domestic  demand  is  projected  to  increase  by  just  over 1%. Due to the slack in global demand, the contraction of  exports  has  further  accelerated.  On  average,  exports will be  2½%  lower  than  the  year  before.  With  imports performing  slightly  better  than  exports  the  balance  of trade in goods and services is expected to shave ½  pp. off  GDP  growth.  Altogether,  GDP  growth  will  fall  to some  ½%,  implying  thus  a  strong  drop  of  some  5  pp. from 2000. As   regards   employment,   average   annual   growth   is estimated  at  around  1½%,  even  assuming  no  major improvements    in    the    second    half    of    the    year. Unemployment will thus fall to 9.2% of the labour force. However,  with  recent  announcements  by  Finnish  firms of   controlled   lay-offs   the   risk   of   an   increase   in unemployment   has   increased.   Wages   and   salaries continue  to  exceed  the  contractual  agreement  of  3.1% for this year implying continued strong wage drift. With the effects of the hike in oil and food prices tapering off, HICP inflation  is  expected  to  moderate  significantly in the   fourth   quarter,   leading   to   an   average   of   2.7%. Following  the  fading  out  of  the  impact  of  last  years exceptional  revenue  factors  (in  particular  high  capital gains  taxes)  and  in  the  face  of  a  sharp  slowdown  of economic  activity,  the  general  government  budgetary surplus  is  expected  to  fall  by  about  2  pp.  to  4¾%  of GDP. Outlook  for  2002  and  2003. Although  the  uncertainty around   the   outlook   of   both   the   Finnish   and   the international economy is considerable, expansive monetary policy in the euro area and a fiscal impulse in Finland  are  expected  to  put  the  economy  back  on  a growth  path  by  mid-2002.  Continued  income  tax  cuts accompanied  by  lower  inflation  will  give  a  boost  to disposable  income  of  households.  Accordingly,  private consumption should grow by about 2%. Simultaneously, improvement  of  external  demand  is  predicted  to  boost exports  of  the  ICT  sector.  However,  notwithstanding lower interest rates, private investment will be subdued, reflecting  increasing  spare  capacity  in  manufacturing and a normalisation of business construction. All in all, output   growth   is   expected   to   gather   momentum   in Summer 2002 resulting in a growth rate of 1¾% in 2002 and of some 3% in 2003. Clearly, given the current great uncertainty  of   the   international   outlook,   and   to   the extent  that  overall  economic  developments  in  Finland are  highly  dependent  on  the  improvement  in  the  ICT sector, the risks to the forecast are considerable. Labour  market. Following  the  steep  slowdown  in  the economy  unemployment  is  expected  to  rise  in  2002. Still, improving domestic demand is expected to prevent firms  from  firing  large  numbers  of  workers  while  the prospects   of   a   more   positive   development   in   the international  economy  towards  2003  will  further  ease pressures for additional dismissals. Accordingly, unemployment is anticipated to decrease again mildly in 2003. Wages  and  prices. Lower  contractual  increases  should lead  to  a  moderation  in  the  average  compensation  of employees   to   some   3½%.   Given   the   slowdown   in economic activity, bottlenecks in the labour market will subside.  However,  some  of  the  effects  of  wage  rises above  centralised  agreements  are  yet  to  be  seen.  Since exceptional factors contributing to inflation are expected to  fade  out,  and  with  the  help  of  slightly  lower  import prices, HICP inflation is projected to ease to around 2%. Public   finances. The   government   budget   for   2002 proposes reductions in income tax and in social security contributions  amounting  to  ¾%  of  GDP.  The  budget further anticipates central government outlays to rise by about  2%,  exceeding  the  spending  guideline  agreed  in spring  2001  by  slightly  over  1%.  In  the  absence  of exceptionally  strong  capital  gains  taxes  collected  in 2000,   and   in   combination   with   the   revenue   losses stemming  from  tax  cuts  and  lower  output  growth,  the general government surplus is estimated to fall to below 3%  of  GDP  in  2002  and  to  2¼%  in  2003.  The  rather moderate decline in the debt ratio in the face of still high government surpluses is explained by low GDP growth in conjunction with the ongoing diversification of social security  institutions’  assets,  implying  a  reduction  in holding  of  domestic  government  bonds.  Accordingly, the  general  government  debt  ratio  is  forecast  to  fall  to about 42% in 2002 and to some 41¾% in 2003		
November/2001	Denmark	Slowdown this year, but growth gradually picking up in 2002 and 2003	Growth .  Real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  be  moderate this  year  and  to  increase  gradually  during  the  forecast period. The modest growth rate this year is partly due to the international slowdown, but it should also be seen in the  context  of  the  high  growth  rate  of  3.2%  in  2000, since the growth rate of last year was inflated by one-off effects of the repair work after a storm that hit Denmark. The  disappearance  of  the  effect  from  the  repair  work will in itself lower GDP growth this year. Overall, GDP growth  is  expected  to  be  1.3%  in  2001  increasing  to 1.6% in 2002 and 2.5% in 2003. GDP components. The main force driving GDP growth in the  forecast  period  is  private  consumption.  The  past two years private consumption has been subdued due to falling  real  disposable  income.  In  the  forecast  period private  consumption  is  expected  to  pick  up  as  real disposable   income   increases.   The   increase   in   real disposable   income   stems   primarily   from   lower   tax payments and lower inflation. The lower interest rate in the forecast period is also expected to fuel consumption growth.  The  indicators  are,  however,  still  mixed  as  to the extent to which this pick-up has already set in. Car sales  in  the  second  quarter  of  2001  rose  quarter-on- quarter for the first time in 1½ years but retail sales are still  sluggish.  Given  that  the  households’  savings  rate has been very low and falling in recent years and that the international   events   in   the   autumn   are   expected   to increase uncertainty, the savings rate is also expected to increase during the forecast period. Gross  fixed  capital  formation  was  the  main  element driving GDP growthin 2000. Due to the slowing of the economy,   which   will   reduce   growth   in   equipment investment   from   2000   very   high   level   and   to   the disappearance   of   the   one-off   effects   from   repair work after  the  storm,  investment  is  expected  to  fall  by around  2%  in  2001and  gradually  pick  up  in  2002  and 2003. The investment growth in 2002 is also expected to be sustained by the  housing package  introduced  by the government    to    increase    the    stock    of    affordable dwellings. In 2003, as the effect of the housing package is  reduced  and  as  the  economy  and  profit  margins  are picking up again, investment growth is primarily driven by that of equipment investment. Exports  have  slowed  in  2001  but  not  to  the  extent suggested   by   Danish   export   market   growth.   Danish exports of agricultural products have benefited from the fact  that  the  animal  diseases  which  hit  Europe  in  the spring  left  Denmark  fairly  untouched.  In  the  forecast period exports are expected to pick up more slowy than export   market   growth   since   unit   labour   costs   are expected to grow relative to those elsewhere. Imports grew rapidly in 2000 due to the high growth rate in   equipment   investment.   The   weaker   growth   in equipment  investment  in  coming  years  is  expected  to bring  growth  of  imports  more  in  line  with  a  “normal” relationship  to  final  demand.  The  relative  development of exports and imports implies that net exports will have a   strong   contribution   to   GDP   growth   this   year,   a negative   contribution   in   2002   and   then   a   positive contribution in 2003. The current account had a healthy surplus in 2000. It is expected  to  increase  this  year  and  thereafter  to  stay around 2½% of GDP. Labour  market. The  labour  market  is  rather  tight  as unemployment continues to fall and has reached a very low level. An indication of the tightness was also seen in the second quarter wage increases for 2001, which were somewhat   higher   than   expected.   The   slowdown   in activity  is  expected  to  ease  the  situation  on  the  labour market,  especially  in  2002.  However,  given  that  firms already   are   experiencing   problems   in   hiring   new employees, the slowdown is expected to a larger extent to be seen in slower growth in productivity rather than unemployment.  Many  firms  will  probably  find  it  too costly to lay people off and then have to rehire them in a still tight labour market if the slowdown is as short-lived as  expected.  Employment  creation  has  been  strong  in recent years, but is expected to slow markedly in 2002. In 2003 it is expected to regain strength. Wages. Annual compensation per employee is expected to increase by just below 4% in each year of the forecast period. To this should be added the effects of additional holidays spread over the period, which will complete the sixth  week  of  holiday  for  most  of  the  labour  market. However, given the tightness of the labour market there is a risk of larger increases in wages. Prices. The  increase  in  the  harmonized  inflation  rate (HICP)  has  slowed  markedly  compared  to  2000  as  the contribution   from   increases   in   oil   prices   has   been reduced. The slowing of the price increases is expected to continue into 2002 facilitated by a further reduction in oil  prices,  a  small  appreciation  of  the krone and  lower profit margins. Inflation is expected to be just below 2% in 2002 and increase slightly in 2003. Public finances. The surplus on the general government finances   is   expected   to   be   2.2%   of   GDP   in   2001 (including  proceeds  of  the  UMTS  licences  of  0.2%  of GDP).   In   2002   tax   payments   from   enterprises   are expected to be slightly lower than in 2001. Furthermore the  fall  in  the  equity  prices  in  2001  has  reduced  the expected  tax  payments  by  pension  companies  both  in 2001 and 2002. The surplus on the general government finances is therefore expected to be somewhat lower in 2002 and increase slightly in 2003. The smaller surplus in   2002   will   slow  down   the   payment   of   the   debt. However,  the  consolidated  gross  debt  as  per  cent  of GDP  is  expected  to  fall  gradually  and  reach  a  level  of 40% of GDP in 2003.		
November/2001	Sweden	Weak demand results in lower growth in 2001, but a pickup is expected in 2002-03	Output. Swedish economic growth was 3.6% in 2000 but fell sharply in the first half of 2001 and is expected to remain weak the rest of the  year. With the sharp fall of GDP    growth    and    at    the    same    time    continued employment  growth,  productivity  growth  should  fall sharply this year. As output recovers in 2002 and 2003, productivity growth should return towards 2% in 2003. Thus, the supply side seems set to allow for respectable GDP  growth,  with  inflation  expected  to  return  towards the  Riksbank’s  inflation  target  of  2%.  However,  the demand side is set to be less encouraging; a slowdown of  growth  of  export  markets  this  year  coincides  with  a cyclical downturn of domestic demand and in particular of  private  consumption.  The  fall  in  share  prices  and pessimistic   consumer   confidence   also   add   to   the subdued    growth    outlook.    In    Q2,    growth    slowed substantially,  notably  private  consumption,  which  was unchanged  on  the  year,  and  exports,  which  fell  in  real terms. However, domestic demand growth is expected to rise in 2002, aided by expansionary economic policies - a continued loose monetary policy, with a repo-rate cut of 50 bp in September, and a fiscal stimulus, via tax cuts of  1.1%  of  GDP  announced  in  the  Budget  for  2002. External  demand  growth  should  pick  up  in  2002  and further   in   2003,   which   should   result   in   a   gradual recovery of exports. GDP is expected to grow by 1.4% in 2001, 1.6% in 2002 and 2.6% in 2003. GDP  components. Private  consumption  should  grow slowly  in  2001,  due  to  declining  consumer  confidence and  a  cyclical  downturn  in  consumption.  Moreover, share prices have continued to fall and result in negative wealth  effects,  although  partly  countered  by  a,  still, strong  housing  market.  The  fiscal  stimulus  stemming from  tax  cuts  in  2002  raises  disposable  incomes  and should   result   in   higher   private   consumption   growth while  at  the  same  time  allow  for  a  rise  in  the  saving ratio. As the economy recovers further in 2003 and a rise of employment growth is expected, private consumption should rise further. Investment growth is expected to be relatively  subdued  over  the  forecast  period  following from the downturn in demand in the short-term and from lower capacity utilisation in the medium-term. However, continued  strong  demand  for  housing  over  the  entire forecast period and the creation of the 3G communications   network   with   most   taking   place   in 2002,  although  revised  downwards  substantially,  helps keeping  total  investment  growth  at  respectable  levels. Stocks  are  expected  to  contribute  negatively  to  growth in  2001  and  into  2002,  as  the  correction  in  industry continues. The worsened global prospects in 2001 have resulted   in   weaker   export   growth.   In   addition,   the previously   fast-growing   telecom   sector,   which   have contributed significantly to exports, have turned around sharply and showed negative growth in Q2. Despite the competitiveness  gains  resulting  from  a  weaker  Krona, exports are expected to fall slightly in 2001. As external demand  growth  gains  momentum  during  2002  and  in 2003,  exports  are  set  to  recover.  With  lower  domestic demand   growth   and   the   stock   correction   described above,   imports   are   also   expected   to   fall   in   2001. However,   imports   should   pick   up   as   final   demand recovers over the remainder of the forecast period. Price  developments. Inflation  has  risen  strongly  since the  spring  this  year  and  in  October  the  CPI  was  2.7% and the HICP 2.9%. While this can in part be attributed to temporary factors, such as rises in food prices, most sub-components  of  the  CPI  show  strong  price  rises  at present. In this context, the consistent weakening of the krona  over  the  year  could  result  in  higher  inflation ahead. However, wages have not accelerated and three- year ahead agreements reached in 2001 for most of the labour  market  limits  the  risk  for  wage-price  inflation. Moreover, as demand growth should be weaker in 2001 and  into  early  2002,  it  is  expected  that  inflation  will come down over the forecast period, although remaining slightly above 2%. Labour market. Employment growth has been strong so far  in  2001,  although  it  has  weakened  over  the  year. Unemployment has stabilised at a low level recently. As economic activity has weakened  over  the  year,  surveys confirm that expanding staffing is decreasingly the most important limitation to expansion and has been replaced by  low  demand.  Lagged  effects  of  announced  lay-offs together  with  a  subdued  demand  outlook  suggest  that employment  growth  will  be  lower  in  2002,  which  will result in a slight increase in the unemployment rate. In 2003,  this  is  expected  to  be  reversed,  as  economic activity gains momentum. Government  finances. The  government  finances  have been   in   surplus   since   1998   and   a   large   surplus   is expected   also   in   2001.   This   is   to   a   large   extent influenced  by  carry-over  effects  of  strong  tax  revenue stemming from, in particular, good corporate profits and capital  gains  in  2000.  The  continued  adherence  to  the central government expenditure ceilings has contributed to  the  strong  fiscal  position.  In  2002  and  2003,  the surplus in public finances is expected to be much lower. Lower  economic  growth,  the  absence  of  the  above- mentioned carry-over effects on revenue and additional tax cuts of the order of 1.1% of GDP contributes to this on   the   revenue   side.   On   the   expenditure   side,   the government  maintains  the  previously  set  expenditure ceilings  on  central  government,  as  announced  in  the Budget  for  2002.  However,  the  budgetary  margins  are very small and expenditure in some areas, such as sick pay,  may  be  higher  than  planned.  In  addition,  higher inflation increases indexed transfer payments. Overall, it is  assumed  that  the  expenditure  ceilings  will  not  be breached,    although    some    discretionary    restraining measures  may  be  necessary.  This  helps  keeping  the public finances in good shape. Gross debt is expected to fall  further,  to  less  than  50%  of  GDP  in  2003,  as  the budget surpluses described above take effect		
November/2001	United Kingdom	Annual  growth  expected  to  be below  trend to  2002  but  should be   sustained   by   consumption growth	Output in  the  first  half  of  2001  decelerated  but  then quarterly growth picked up to 0.6% in Q3 from 0.4% in Q2, though year on year growth slowed a little to 2.2% from 2.3% in Q2. Household expenditure remained very buoyant in Q2 (the latest quarter for which expenditure data  is  available)  and  retail  sales  in  Q3  also  suggest strong  growth.  Fixed  investment  recovered  in  Q2,  and general   government   consumption   grew   respectably. However,  these  positive  aspects  were  partly  offset  by falls in stock-building and exports as world growth, and consequently  UK  markets,  slowed.  On  the  output  side, services  output  continued  to  rise  strongly  in  Q3  but industrial  production  fell,  in  association  with  falling exports.   The  labour  market,  despite  the  slowdown  in growth,  has  stayed  strong  Productivity,  grew  by  only 1.6%  year  on  year  in  Q2;  down  from  2.1%  growth  in Q1.  Inflationary  pressures  remain  weak  -  on  the  HICP measure, inflation is under 2% and is around the lowest in  the  EU.  RPIX  inflation  is  a  little  below  the  2.5% target. Forecast  output .  Following  the  slowdown  in  the  first half of 2001, the preliminary estimate for Q3 shows that growth picked up a little despite the world slowdown. It was sustained by strong growth in retail sales. Growth is expected  to be slow in Q4 as world growth continues to be   slow   and   confidence   falls   in   the   aftermath   of September 11. GDP growth, on average, is expected to be a bit higher than 2% in 2001. It is expected to remain below trend in the first half of 2002 but pick up in the third quarter as growth in UK markets recovers. There is little  reason  to  expect  a  particularly  sharp  downturn  in the  UK.  While  the  external  factors,  both  direct  and indirect,  suggest  downward  pressure  on  growth  in  the near  term,  especially  given  the  UK’s  above  average exposure  to  US  economic  and  financial  developments, this may be offset to a large extent by domestic policy; namely   monetary   loosening   in   the   shape   of   a   2% cumulative cut in the repo rate since the beginning of the 2001  and  a  fiscal  stimulus,  largely  in  the  form  of planned  rises  in  general  government  spending.  With GDP  recovering  within  the  year,  growth  for  2002  on average  should  be  around  1¾%.  With  growth  below trend both in 2001 and 2002, a  negative output gap will emerge  during  the  course  of  2002.  Unemployment  is expected  to  rise  by  0.3  of  a  percentage  point.  Upward pressures on wage increases are not expected and though productivity  growth  may  remain  weak,  rises  in  unit labour   costs   will   be   subdued.   With   growth   in   UK markets strengthening, and with a small negative output gap emerging in 2002, growth should rebound in 2003 to a little above trend at 3%. Output  components .  Growth  in  household  consumption is expected to be maintained in   2002, albeit below the rapid  rates  observed  in  2001.  Real  wage  earnings  are expected  to  grow  moderately  and  disposable  incomes will  benefit  from  the  cuts  in  interest  rates.  However, some rise in the saving ratio is  expected  as  confidence may weaken in the face of the terrorist attack, weakness in  equity  markets  and  an  easing  of  the  labour  market. The strong net asset position of the personal sector could limit   the downside risk to consumption growth. On the other hand, fixed investment is expected to grow slowly –    strong    planned    boosts    to    general    government investment  will  be  offset  to  a  large  extent  by  a  fall  in business  investment  which  is  expected  to  be  hit  by  a number  of  negative  factors  like  falling  profitability,  a significant financial deficit, rising cost of capital, and  a slowdown, if temporary, in inward investment. Government   consumption   is expected   to   be   an important  contributor  to  demand  growth  as  established in  the  Government's  Comprehensive  Spending  Review that details spending plans to 2003-04. Export growth is expected to be weak in 2002 as UK markets weaken but import    growth    will    also    be    slow    as    equipment investment falls. Labour  Market .  The  labour  market  has  continued  to strengthen with unemployment hitting a twenty five year low and  the  rate  is  5.1%.  Employment  is  also  growing moderately and rose by 0.6% in the year to June-August of 2001. Wage earnings are not a cause for concern. The labour market is expected to loosen a little in 2002 with no   employment   creation   and   unemployment   rising, though  any  rise  in  unemployment  will  be  limited  by active  labour  market  measures  such  as  the  ‘new  deal’. Productivity  is  expected  to  remain  subdued  in  2002. With a rebound in GDP growth expected in 2003, and an expected   tighter   labour   market,   it   is   forecast   that productivity  will  accelerate  in  2003.  Unit  labour  costs rises  are  expected  to  be  moderate  and  sustainable  over the forecast period. External balance . The current account is projected to be in deficit rising to close to 3% of GDP in 2002 before falling back to 2¾% in 2003. The negative contribution of net exports of goods and services to GDP growth in 2002 and 2003 is expected to fall a little. Prices . HICP inflation is low at under 2% - the lowest in the  EU.  RPIX  inflation  is  below  the  2.5%  target.  It  is expected that the latter will continue to be met. Current benign   developments   in   unit   labour   costs,   should continue in the face of a slowdown in growth. Public  finances .  The  general  government  finances  are expected  to  remain  in  surplus  over  the  period.  Despite slower growth than expected in 2001, the out-turn in the first  three  quarters  of  the  year  was  of  a  substantial surplus – buoyed by tax revenue. A surplus of over 1% of GDP is expected for the year. This will fall to around 0.4%   in   2002   as   growth   slows   and   discretionary expenditure  growth  rises  as  planned.  With  strong  GDP growth  in  2003  the  fiscal  position  is  not  expected  to worsen.  The  ratio  of  gross  debt  to  GDP  will  fall  to around 35% by the end of 2003.		
May/2002	Belgium	Progressive recovery in economic activity in 2002	The situation in 2001 and prospects Economic  activity  is  expected  to  recover  in  the  first quarters  of  this  year  and  more  firmly  in  the  second semester,  as  prospects  for  the  European  and  global economy will improve and international trade progressively gain momentum after recording negative growth  rates  in 2001.  The  synthetic  indicator  of  the National  Bank  of  Belgium  - which  has  been  a  good early  indicator  of  turning  points  of  the  business  cycle with  a  lead  of  one  quarter -  recorded  such  an  upward movement   in   December 2001,   the   first   after   many months.  The  Belgian  economy  is  expected  to  grow in 2002 at a rate marginally higher than 1%, similar to that   estimated   for 2001.   However,   the   profile   and composition  of  growth  should  be  quite  different  this year:  while  economic  activity  was  weak  towards  the end of last year –according to provisional estimates real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2001 declined by 0.4% on the  previous  quarter-  a  gradual  recovery  of  economic growth should take place from the start of this year and strengthen in subsequent quarters, creating the momentum  for  a  more  robust  GDP  growth  in 2003; moreover, while deteriorating economic conditions and business confidence in 2001 led to a massive reduction in stocks,  with a  negative  contribution of  1 percentage point to GDP growth, a gradual reconstitution of stocks is   expected   to   take   place   this   year   as   economic prospects improve. GDP components Both  export  and  import  volumes  should  grow  faster in 2002  compared  to 2001  but  the  contribution  of  net exports  to  GDP  growth  will  be  negative  this  year,  in contrast    to    the    situation    in 2001    when    imports contracted   more   than   exports;   the   expected   faster growth of imports this year is related to a re-building of stocks   and   to   evidence   that   the   business   cycle   in Belgium leads that of the euro area. After two years of low  growth,  the  economy  is  expected  to  expand  by 2.8%   in 2003,   taking   advantage   of   the   projected recovery   in   international    trade    and    more    robust domestic  demand.  Private  consumption  should  remain the  backbone  of  GDP  growth,  supported  by  improved employment  and  households  real  income.  The  saving rate  of  households,  which  reached  the  lowest  level  in many  years in 2001, is expected  to  rise  somewhat  this year  and  stabilise  next  year  as  economic  activity  and employment improve. Business investment is expected to  be  more  robust  in 2003,  after  two  years  of  very modest   increase,   responding   to   improved   demand conditions    and,    to    some    extent,    profitability    of companies; investment in housing should also rise from a relatively low growth rate this year; public investment should be higher in 2003, after two years of decline. Labour market, cost and prices Employment  increase  was  relatively  robust  in 2001, estimated   at   1.1%,   despite   the   sharp   slowdown   in economic activity, a development reflecting the lagged effects  of  changes  in  the  business  cycle  on  the  labour market; job creation is expected to be very limited, this year,  as  companies  are  adjusting  to  changing  market conditions. Employment should increase again in 2003 although at a more modest rate compared to the recent past.  Unemployment  should  rise  somewhat  this  year and  is  expected  to  resume  its  falling  trend  from 2003. After   some   acceleration   in   consumer   prices   last January,  due  mainly  to  transient  factors,  inflation  is expected to resume its falling trend which started at the middle  of  last  year;  underlying  inflation  which  was rising    until    November,    has    also    started    moving downwards.  The  HICP  should  decelerate  to  1.7%,  on average,   in 2002,   down   from   2.4%   in 2001;   lower import prices, notably oil prices since mid-2001, which are  expected  to  prevail  on  average  in 2002,  should contribute  considerably to  such  a  trend;  moreover,  the abolition  this  year  of  the  radio  and  TV  licence  fee  in Flanders  and  Brussels  Regions  is  expected  to  reduce inflation  by  about  0.3  percentage  points.  Inflation  is expected  to  remain at a similar  level in 2003, as some acceleration    in    nominal    wages,    due    to    stronger economic activity and tightening labour markets, should be  offset  by  declining  unit  labour  costs  and  enhanced competition in the  domestic  and  international  markets Concerns   expressed   recently   in   Belgium,   based   on studies   of   economic   advisory   bodies   such   as   the “National Economic Council”, about loss of competitiveness  by  the  Belgian  economy  vis-à-vis  its main trading partners in recent years, should encourage moderate wage developments. A new framework wage agreement  for  the  period  2003-2004  is  expected  to  be concluded by the end of this year. Public finances In  spite  of  the  sharp  slowdown  in  economic  activity in 2001,   the   general   government   accounts   were   in balance as in 2000 and recorded a small surplus of 0.2% of  GDP,  when  including  the  UMTS  licenses  receipts. This  result  was  made  possible  by  maintaining  a  high primary  surplus,  estimated  at  6.7%  of  GDP;  ad  hoc factors, including UMTS receipts, contributed by about 0.3% of GDP to this outcome. In 2002,  the  general  government  sector  is  expected  to register  a  0.2%  of  GDP  deficit  resulting  mainly  from the  adverse  impact  on  tax  revenue  of  a  rather  weak economic activity  and,  to  some  extent,  from increased expenditure  is  specific  areas,  such  as  health  care.  The government,  in  the  context  of  the  spring  budgetary control   exercise,   announced   a   tighter   control   of government   expenditure,   on   a   monthly   basis,   and lowered the targeted growth rate of primary expenditure for   this   year   in   order   to   achieve   the   budgetary objectives. In 2003, the general government accounts would turn to a surplus of 0.2% of GDP resulting mainly from higher economic   activity   and   relatively   contained   primary expenditure  growth.  Public  finance  projections  assume that, broadly, the budgetary strategy of the 2001 update of the stability programme of Belgium will be followed; this  implies,  in  particular,  primary  surpluses  of  the order of 6% per year realised mainly through control of primary expenditures. A corporate tax reform announced   last   March   will   apply   from   2003   and according to the government will be budgetary neutral. According  to  the  forecast,  the  government  revenue  to GDP  ratio  is  expected  to  decline  in  the  coming  two years, while the expenditure ratio is projected to remain practically unchanged this year before resuming a more clear  falling trend  in 2003. Corrected  for  the  influence of  the  economic  cycle,  the  estimated  budgetary  result in 2001   and   that   projected   for   this   year   show   an improvement  in  the  underlying  budgetary  position;  a smaller improvement in the cyclically adjusted budgetary balance is projected for 2003. The decline in the government debt ratio was modest in 2001 and less than initially projected, a development attributed to the low  nominal  GDP  growth  as  well  as  ad  hoc  factors, notably  the  incorporation  in  the  general  government sector  of  the  debt  of  the  former  OCCH  which  was guaranteed by the State; exogenous, ad hoc, operations increased the debt to GDP ratio by around 2 percentage points.  The  government  debt  ratio  is  projected  to  fall further  in  the  coming  two  years  to  marginally  below 100 percent of GDP at the end of 2003.		
May/2002	Growth gradually picking up and driven by domestic demand	Growth gradually picking up and driven by domestic demand	The economy in 2001 The  Danish  economy  slowed  in  2001  due  both  to  the fading of extensive repair works in 2000, after a storm that  hit  Denmark,  and  to  the  international  slowdown. The  Danish  economy  was,  however,  not  as  adversely affected  as  many other  economies  by the  international downturn  due  to  a  favourable  composition  of  exports. Agricultural production was left fairly untouched by the livestock  diseases  which  hit  other  countries  thereby leading  the  way  for  export  market  gains.  Overall,  real GDP growth was 0.9%. After  having  remained  largely  unchanged  since  1998 private  consumption  picked  up  slightly  in  2001  and grew by 0.6%. The increase was, however, well below that  of  real  disposable  incomes.  Investments,  which were  buoyant  in  2000,  remained  unchanged  in  real terms in 2001 as the impact of the repair works after the storm  faded  and  profit  margins  declined.  Inventories increased during the year from a very low level in 2000 and   contributed   to   GDP   growth   by  0.4   percentage points.  Growth  rates  of  both  exports  and  imports  of goods  fell  markedly  compared  to  the  high  levels  in 2000  and  net  exports  had  a  small  negative  impact  on GDP growth. The  labour  market  tightened  further  as  unemployment fell  slightly  and  employment  rose  by  0.5%.  The  tight labour  market  also  resulted  in  high  wage  increases during  the  year.  HICP  inflation  came  down  to  2.3% after having been relatively high in 2000. The   surplus   on   the   general   government   finances, according to the EDP definition, remained high in 2001 at 3.1% of GDP (including UMTS revenues of 0.2% of GDP) and the general government debt declined further to 44.7% of GDP. Prospects Based  on  the  preliminary  quarterly  national  accounts and  industrial  turnover  the  fourth quarter  of 2001  was bleak.  GDP  grew  by  only  0.1%  in  real  terms  and industrial turnover fell on the quarter. However,  there  are  signs  that  a  turn  around  could  be expected   soon   as   the   quarterly   national   accounts confirmed  the  continued  increase  in  growth  rates  of exports   and   private   consumption   finally   picked   up slightly. Car sales and retail sales developed stronger in the first months of 2002 compared to the last quarters of 2001.  Furthermore,  industrial  orders  have  picked  up recently  and  economic  survey  indicators  indicate  that the general sentiment is improving for producers, but to a lesser extent for consumers. Real GDP growth is expected to average 1.7% in 2002 and should start to recover  more rapidly in the  second quarter  of  2002.  Strong  growth  rates  are  expected  to continue  into  2003  leading  to  an  average  real  GDP growth rate of 2.5%. In both years domestic demand is expected  to  be  the  main  factor  driving  GDP  growth with neutral or negative contribution from net exports. GDP components Private consumption is expected to pick up further over the forecast horizon supported by continued increases in real disposable income. Growth rates of investment are set to increase over the forecast period. Investments in equipment  are  expected  to  pick  up  over  the  forecast horizon  as  profit  margins  and  the  production  outlook improve.  Investments  in  housing  are  in  both   years supported by the government’s  housing package. With regards to non-residential construction a slow development is expected in the first half of 2002 as the current  uncertainty  on  whether  the  pick  up  has  set  in may   postpone   larger   investment   projects,   but   an increase is expected in the second  half of 2002  and  to continue into 2003. In 2002, no growth contribution is expected  from  stocks,  while  in  2003  a  small  positive contribution is expected as the economy picks up. Exports  of  goods  are  expected  to  grow  fairly  in  line with  external  demand.  Imports  of  goods  which  were relatively low in 2001  should  return to  a  more normal relationship  to  final  demand.  Exports  and  imports  of services are set to develop fairly in line, but somewhat below  recent  years’  very  high  growth  rates.  Overall, these developments would lead to a negative contribution to GDP growth from net exports this year and a neutral contribution in 2003. The   large   current   account   surplus   should   decline slightly in 2002, followed by a minor increase in 2003 Costs and prices Inflation (HICP) increased in the first quarter of 2002 as a result of increasing oil prices and a technical change to   the   index   for   clothing.   Inflation   is   expected   to decelerate  through  the  year  on  the  back  of  falling  oil prices.  The  full  effect  on  the  inflation  rate  of  the  “tax freeze” introduced by the new government will first be visible in 2003 and combined with the disappearance of one-off  effects,  it  is  expected  to  lead  to  an  average inflation  rate  of  2.1%  in  2003.  The  continued  tight labour market and high wage increases may add to the price increases. In   2002   productivity   increases   are   expected   to   be slightly subdued as the increase in unemployment does not fully reflect the slowing of the economy. This is due to the tight labour market, where firms are likely to hold back on lay-offs as it may be difficult to rehire when the economy picks up. For 2003 productivity increases are set to return to “normal” levels. Labour market The   labour   market   is   expected   to    remain   tight throughout   the   forecast   period.   However,   a   minor increase  in  unemployment  is  expected  in  2002  as  a delayed effect of the slowdown in economic growth in 2001.   In   2003,   unemployment   is   expected   to   fall marginally   again.   In   both   years   unemployment   is forecast  to  be  close  to  the  estimated  structural  level. Employment creation is set to slow markedly in 2002, as a reaction to  the current slow economic growth but also  as  a  result  of  the  reduction  of  the  number  of employees  in central  government.  To  some  extent  this reduction curbs the trend for rising public employment, even    though    increases    in    employment    in    local governments    are    foreseen.    In    2003,    employment creation  is  expected  to  pick  up  again.  Given  the  tight labour  market,  wage  increases  are  expected  to  remain relatively   high   over   the   forecast   period,   hovering around  3½-3¾%,  after  correction  for  the  reduction  in working  time.  However,  given  the  tightness  of  the labour  market  there  is  a  risk  of  larger  increases  in wages.  Wage  agreements  for  the  private  sector  cover most of the forecast period whereas public sector wages are negotiated this spring. Public finances The  surplus  on  the  general  government  finances  is expected  to  decline  to  2.1%  of  GDP  this  year  as  the slowdown  in  2001  leads  to  smaller  increases  in  tax revenues, especially on taxes paid by corporations. This effect  is,  however,  partly  offset  by  the  reduction  in subsidies  and  the  slim-lining  of  central  government undertaken  in  the  budget  for  2002.  Furthermore,  the “special pension contribution” which amounts to 1% of the  total  wage  bill  is  proposed  to  be  changed  from  a public  pension  scheme  to  a  private  scheme  as  the redistributive   effects   in   the    pension   scheme    are eliminated.  This  would  lower  revenues,  the surplus  on public  finances  and  the  tax  burden  by  approximately ½%  of  GDP  in  both  2002  and  2003.  In  2003,  the surplus on general  government finances is expected  to increase to 2.4% of GDP due to the stronger growth rate of the economy. The  balance  on  general  government  has  become  more volatile  due  to  changes  to  the  way  pension  funds  are taxed.  Revenues  are  now  more  closely  linked  to  the developments in the stock market and therefore difficult to predict. The increased volatility may be in the order of 1 percentage point of GDP. The general government debt to GDP ratio is expected to  decline  by  5  percentage  points  over  the  forecast period and reach some 40% of GDP in 2003		
May/2002	Germany	At the turning point	The economy in 2001 GDP rose by 0.6% in 2001, which constitutes the worst performance of the German economy since 1993. Only the first quarter of the  year  registered  positive growth, not least because the tax reform gave a boost to private consumption.  This  was,  however,  only  a  temporary reprieve  from  the  impact  of  the  2000  oil  price  hike. Sharply  falling  investment  volumes  brought  economic growth  to  a  halt  in  the  second  quarter.  Construction, which had been falling since the middle of the nineties, fell  yet  again  by  a  massive  5.8%  in  2001.  Equipment investment fared hardly better with a decline of 5%. As  consumption  also  started  to  decline  in  the  second half of the year, GDP growth turned negative from the third  quarter  onward,  already  before  the  events  of  11 September.    By    severely    lowering    consumer    and business  confidence,  the  terrorist  attacks  deepened  the economic downswing. In this pessimistic environment, demand  was  increasingly  met  by  reducing  inventories instead  of  increasing  production.  The  resulting  stock depletions  alone  reduced  GDP  growth  in  2001  by  0.9 percentage  points.  Had  it  not  been  for  the  statistical overhang from 2000, the economy would have actually stagnated in 2001. At the end of 2001, unemployment figures were above the  levels  registered  a  year  before.  Nevertheless,  the average   number   of   unemployed   in   2001   remained 30,000  below  the  figure  for  2000.  The  high  level  of unemployed  will,  however,  affect  the  aggregate  figure for the following year. Consumer  price  inflation,  which  peaked  in  May  at 3.5%, declined rapidly as a result of falling energy and import prices, reaching an average rate of 2.4%. Prospects At  a  beginning  of  2002,  the  economy  finds  itself  at  a turning  point.  On  the  one  hand,  growth  in  the  first quarter   of   the   year   will   be   low   due   to   a   fall   in investments  and  shrinking  consumption.  This  is  also picked up by the Ifo index, where the assessment of the current situation is at its lowest level since 1993. On  the  other  hand,  there  is  a  remarkable  upturn  in producer expectations. Both the Ifo  expectations index and  the  ZEW  confidence  indicator  have  been  rising rapidly since November 2001. Combined with a recent increase  in  orders,  even  if  mostly  from  abroad,  this points  strongly  to  a  recovery  around  the  middle  of 2002.  Expectations  are  that  the  economic  momentum will be maintained also in 2003. Despite a substantial upswing, leading to a year-on-year growth  rate  in  the  last  quarter  of  2.6%,  average  GDP growth  in  2002  will  remain  at  0.8%,  barely  above growth  in  2001.  This  is  a  result  of  a  strong  negative statistical  carry-over,  which  affects  also  the  individual components  of  GDP,  especially  investment.  The  full impact of the recovery will, however, be visible in the figures for 2003, with a predicted growth of 2.7%. By  the  same  token,  unemployment   will   remain  on average   above   the   4   million   mark   in   2002,   some 180,000 higher than the year before. It should, however, revert to its original level by 2003. GDP components Domestic demand lags substantially behind international developments.  Foreign orders are  picking up  fast,  implying  strong  increases  in  exports  from  the second  quarter  of  2002  onwards.  Despite  a  negative statistical   overhang,   annual   export   growth   should therefore   be   slightly   above   2%.   Imports,   however, which are falling  dramatically  in  the  first  quarter,  will likely  be  stagnant  over  the  year.  Consequently,  GDP growth in 2002 will be carried by a very strong external contribution of 0.8%, even though this is barely half the 2001 value. Only in 2003 will this effect disappear. Domestic   final   demand   will   contract   in   2002.   In particular,  private  consumption  remains  bogged  down by  the  high  level  of  unemployment,  and  is  likely  to shrink  significantly  in  the  first  quarter.  It  is,  however, expected  to  pick  up  by  the  second  half  of  the  year, supporting the economic upswing. Similarly, the rise in business confidence is expected to manifest itself in growing investment volumes from the second  half  of  2002  onwards.  If  wage  negotiations  in spring  will  not  be  disruptive,  the  growth  impulse  will come mostly from equipment investment. Construction will  continue   to   remain   flat,   because   a   pick-up   in business  construction  and  to  a  much  lesser  extent  in housing  will  be  balanced  by  a  likely  fall  in  public construction,  as  cash-strapped  local  governments  are expected to cut down on their investment plans. Due to a very strong negative overhang in both equipment and construction    investment,    the    year-on-year    growth figures  for  2002  will,  nevertheless,  remain  negative. Investment  figures  for  2003,  by  contrast,  should  be positive again. A significant  factor  in  driving  growth  will  come  from inventories. A reversal of the strong stock depletion in 2001 is likely to contribute positively to growth in 2002 in  the  order  of  nearly  one  half  of  a  percentage  point. This reversal more than matches the anticipated decline in the contribution of net exports and of final demand. Costs and prices Consumer  price  inflation  is  likely  to  fall  further  to  a level  of  around  1.8%  annually  in  2002,  due  to  lower energy prices. Even though the fall in oil prices  might have  come  to  a  halt,  notably  gas  prices,  which  follow oil prices with a lag, will continue to decline. The short- term upward blip in the CPI registered in January 2002 as a result of hikes in tobacco, fuel and other taxes and of  a  bad  vegetables  harvest  should  be  reverted  during the course of the year. Wages will likely rise more than in 2001, as a result of difficult  ongoing  wage  negotiations.  Nevertheless,  one can  expect  that  the  high  level  of  unemployment  will limit  the  wage  increases  to  a  level  that  should  not threaten   price   stability.   Average   inflation   in   2003 should therefore remain at the same low level as 2002, because   acceleration   in   economic   activity   is   not expected to result in strong price pressures. Public finances According   to   the   latest   estimate   by   the   Statistical Office,  the  2001  general  government  deficit  reached 2.7% of GDP, compared to a deficit of 1.3% of GDP in the year 2000 (excluding UMTS). This deterioration is mainly due to the stronger than expected  slowdown  in growth; expenditure overruns, however, occurred in the health care sector and in some Länder. In  the  current  year,  the  general  government  deficit  is expected  to  reach  2.8%  of  GDP;  the  slight  increase would not only be due to the implemented rise in some benefits but also to the higher than budgeted payments resulting  from  rising  unemployment.  Furthermore,  the projected  growth  pattern  (weak  private  consumption and   an  important  growth   contribution   from   stocks) would not be tax-friendly. Government consumption is forecast to rise by more than 2% on the back of higher spending on internal and external security, a higher rise in public sector salaries and rising health expenditure. Given the budgetary constraint and the projected strong growth  performance  and  in  spite  of  the  next  step  of income  tax  reform,  which  reduces  taxes  by  0.3%  of GDP, the deficit in 2003 is forecast to decline to 2.2% of  GDP.   Assuming  unchanged   policies,   this  deficit forecast is based on higher taxes due to a strong growth of  private  consumption  and  employment  and  lower social security transfers due to a fall in unemployment. The current 2003 estimate assumes that there will be no decline in social security contributions and that the rise in health expenditure will be more moderate than in the recent  past.  Moreover,  wage  agreements  in  the  public sector are expected to be moderate. In 2001, the debt ratio has declined to slightly less than 60% of GDP but is expected to rise again to 60.8% in 2002   as   a   consequence   of   the   combination   of   a relatively high nominal deficit and weak nominal GDP growth. With the nominal deficit projected to decrease clearly  in  2003  and  nominal  GDP  growth  forecast  to come  close  to  4%,  the  debt  ratio  should  again  come close to the Treaty’s reference value		
May/2002	Greece	Economic growth is easing but activity continues at a strong pace	The economy in 2001 Real GDP rose still at a strong pace in 2001, exceeding the EU and the euro area average, despite weak export markets;   the   expansion   was   mainly   supported   by domestic  demand.  Considerably  lower  interest  rates, since the adoption of the euro as from 1 January 2001, combined  with  increased  financial  flows  from  the  EU Structural  Funds  and  the  preparation  for  the  Olympic Games   of   2004   have   boosted   investment   which increased   much   faster   than   real   GDP.   Residential investment posted a strong recovery as a result of lower lending rates and of strong supply for housing loans. On the  other  hand,  a  spectacular  increase  in  consumer credit supply supported private consumption which rose by more than 3%. Consumer spending was also assisted by  the  recovery  in  real  disposable  income  despite  a deceleration  in  non-labour  income  to  be  attributed  to lower  income  from  interest.  On  the  external  side,  the slowdown  in  world  demand  reduced  significantly  the rate  of  increase  in  exports,  but  imports  also  slowed down resulting in a marginally negative contribution of the external balance to real GDP growth. The  situation  in  the  labour  market  improved  but  at  a slow pace.  A mild job creation in the  services and  the construction sectors was not sufficient to offset the fall in employment in the traditional manufacturing sectors. Total   employment   is   estimated   to   have   declined marginally in 2001. On the other hand, the unemployment   rate   fell   below   11%   in   2001   and remained  thus  at  a  high  level.  Wage  increases  were moderate  in  the  framework  of  the  benchmark  wage agreement conditions for the private sector. Consumer  price  inflation  started  to  decelerate  in  the Summer months but accelerated by the end of the year partly  as  a  result  of  temporary  shocks  as  high  food prices  due  to  bad  whether.  Nonetheless,  underlying inflation exceeded the headline rate throughout the year implying  the  persistence  of  second  round  effects  from the oil prices hike in 2000. In 2001, consumer inflation accelerated to 3.4% as measured by the national index andto3.7%asmeasuredbytheharmonizedindexof consumer prices, up  from  3.2%  and  2.9%  respectively in 2000. GDP components in 2002 and 2003 Economic  activity  prospects  continue  to  be  good  and will  improve  with  the  external  recovery.  Real  GDP growth is expected to continue to  rise above potential, averaging  below  4%  in  2002  and  to  recover  in  2003 following   strengthening   world   demand.   Thus,   job creation   should   start   responding   positively   to   the current expansion phase, potentially assisted also by the implementation  of  active  labour  market  policies.  The unemployment rate should then  fall below 10% by the end of the forecast period. Consumer spending is expected to remain sustained but with no marked acceleration given the slow improvement  in the  situation in the  labour  market  and uncertainty   with  respect   to   inflation  pressures.   The driving  force  for  real  GDP  growth  in  both  years  will, thus, be investment. Activity in the construction sector will  be  buoyant  as  a  number  of  infrastructure  plans needs  to  be  finished  before  the  Olympic  Games  of 2004, but also residential construction will continue to grow   at   rates   above   real   GDP   growth.   Short-term indicators suggest that residential construction will also remain strong. Public investment growth, supported by large  inflows  from  EU  Structural  Funds,  and  lower interest   rates   will   also   assist   private   investment. Investment in equipment goods is expected to continue at   a   strong   pace   but   this   should   imply   additional increase in imports exerting a dampening effect on real output.  Nonetheless,  the  expected  recovery  in  world demand  should  boost  exports  progressively  over  the forecast period, keeping the average contribution of the real external balance broadly unchanged. Costs and prices Consumer prices accelerated in the first quarter of 2002, rising on average by 3.9% (national definition) and by 4.4%  (the  harmonized   index).   Underlying   measures suggest a mixed picture: core inflation, measured by the CPI   (national   definition)   excluding   fresh   food   and vegetables and fuels, is on a downward trend and rose below the headline rate in January and February 2002. In  contrast,  wholesale  prices  have  accelerated  since December and are exceeding the headline CPI rate. Price  developments  are  influenced  by  a  number  of factors  that  point  to  opposite  directions.  Taking  into account the  underlying  assumptions  for  world  primary commodities    price    increases,    oil    prices    and    the exchange rate of the euro, inflation should decelerate in coming  quarters.  On  the  domestic  side,  in  2002  some acceleration   in   wages   will   be   implied   from   the application  of  the  compensation  clause  for  the  higher than expected inflation rate in 2001; the adjustment will be  equal  to  1.1%  and  will  result  in  an  acceleration  in real   compensations;   moreover,   the   outcome   of   the ongoing  negotiations  on  wage  increases  in  the  private sector will be crucial in determining cost-pressures both in    2002    and    2003.    Furthermore,    despite    some weakening   in   2002,   the   economy   is   expected   to continue growing above potential. On the basis of the above, there may be no significant deceleration   in   the   rate   of   inflation   until   2003. Consumer price increases are forecast to average above 3% in 2002 and 2003. Public finances in 2001 In 2001, the general government accounts reached their first  surplus after  three decades, although the target  of the stability programme, a surplus of 0.5% of GDP, was missed.   However,   excluding   non   budgeted   receipts from the sale of mobile phone licenses (UMTS) which amounted  to  0.5%  of  GDP,  in  2001,  the  government accounts would still be in deficit of 0.4% of GDP. The   implementation  of  the   2001   State   budget   was adversely   affected   by   slower   than   projected   GDP growth  which  resulted  in  a  shortfall  in  tax  revenues, only    partly    offset    by    higher    non-tax    revenues. Moreover,  the  projected  restrain  in  current  primary expenditure was not fully realised. After  reaching  6.2%  of  GDP  in  2000,  the  primary surplus  of  the  general  government  remained  at  a  high level  (equal  to  6.3%  of  GDP  or  5.8%  of  GDP  when excluding  receipts  from  UMTS  licenses).  As  a  result, the   general   government   debt   ratio   continued   its downward trend initiated in the mid-1990s, but was still close to 100% of GDP at the end of 2001 1 . Public finances in 2002 and 2003 The   State   budget   for   2002   and   the   2001   updated stability  programme  target  a  deficit  consistent  with  a surplus  of  0.8%  of  GDP  for  the  general  government, down   from   1.5%   projected   in   the   2000   stability programme.  Underlying  further  improvement  in  the budgetary position, there is the continuing reduction in debt   servicing   costs   which   follows   the   decline   in interest rates and in the debt ratio. For 2003, the 2001 update of the stability programme projects a surplus of 1% of GDP, a level which represents half the projection included    in    the    first    stability    programme.    The downward  revision  of  the  budgetary  targets  is  mostly explained by the assumed much lower rate of growth in real GDP. 1 Eurostat is not currently in a position to certify the figures included in the Spring  notification 2002  of Greece  under the  excessive  deficit  procedure (according   to   Council   Regulation   n°   3605/93,   amended   by   Council Regulation n°475/2000); among other reasons, uncertainties are related to the share convertible bonds treatment. The  debt  ratio  is  also  projected  to  decline  albeit  at  a slower  pace  than  projected  previously,  to  around  93% of  GDP  in  2003.  The  budgetary  strategy  is  based  on further  decline  in  the  interest  burden  for  the  general government, while the projected fall in current primary expenditure should partly compensate the impact of the tax   package   announced   at   end-2001.   The   primary surplus   of   the   general   government   is   projected   to decline   marginally   but   to   remain   at   a   high   level. However, the projected cut in primary spending may be difficult to implement given that the main components of current spending are highly inelastic (mostly, wages and grants). Furthermore, under unchanged policies, the performance   of   budget   revenues,   in   particular   tax revenues,  seems  to  have  been  overvalued.  Thus,  it  is likely that the general government accounts will remain in surplus, in both 2002  and  2003, but  at  lower  levels than projected in the stability programme. This explains that  the  government  debt  ratio  can  be  expected  to decline only moderately		
May/2002	Spain	Expected recovery in the second half of 2002	Activity In 2001 GDP decelerated significantly, recording 2.8% growth  for  the  whole  year,  in  sharp  contrast  to  4.1% growth in 2000. The deceleration was mainly driven by final domestic demand with growth of 2.7% contrasting with 4.4% recorded in 2000; accordingly, its contribution to GDP growth declined to 2.8 percentage points from 4.5 percentage points in the preceding year. The    change    in    inventories    provided    a    positive contribution to GDP growth of 0.1 points. The external sector  also  showed  markedly  slower  growth  of  both exports  and  imports,  resulting  in  a  negative  growth contribution  of  0.1  percentage  points  after  -0.2%  in 2000. In  2002  growth  of  domestic  demand  is  envisaged  to moderate further  while external demand is expected to recover slightly. In the year as a whole GDP growth is expected  to  be  2.1%,  with  a  significant  recovery  that should  become  evident  in  the  second  half  of  the  year. This  recovery profile  is  expected  to  continue  in  2003, with GDP growth of 3.1%, roughly in line with that of estimated potential. GDP components The slower  growth experienced  in 2001  is  mainly  due to  significant  reductions  in  private  consumption  and investment  growth  rates.  Private  consumption  grew  in real terms by 2.7% in 2001, from 4.0% in 2000. Due to a   small   acceleration   in   the   last   quarter,   attributed partially to spending of accumulated peseta notes ahead of  the  introduction  of  euro  notes  and  the  resilience  of employment,  there  is  a  positive  carry-over  effect  of around 0.8 points in 2002. Low growth of gross  fixed capital   formation,   2.5%   in   2001,   can   mostly   be attributed to investment in equipment falling 2.2% due to worsened business expectations. On the external side, the   moderate   growth   of   exports   of   3.4%   in   2001 contrasts with the 9.6% in 2000, in accordance with the downward trend observed in world demand. For 2002 as a whole a further deceleration is expected given  the  weakness  at  the  end  of  2001.  Nevertheless, through the year a recovery is envisaged in all demand components with the exception of government consumption expenditure which remains stable, following  the   expected   recovery  of   world   demand. Private consumption is expected to grow by around 2% as  a  consequence  of  moderation  in  employment  and wage  growth,  non-indexation  of  income  tax  brackets and  to  the  disappearance  of  the  end-2001  euro  effect noted above. Nevertheless, a recovery is expected in the second  half,  which  will  consolidate  during  2003,  as  a result   of   faster   job   creation   and   higher   growth   of compensation   of   employees.   Consequently,   private consumption should expand by over 3.1% in 2003. The saving ratio is envisaged to recover slightly from a 2001 trough. Following  a  weak  performance  through  2001,  whole- year investment will continue to show a deceleration in 2002, growing by 1.9%. An improved business climate in response to better growth prospects and a decline in real   unit   labour   costs   should   fuel   a   recovery   in investment from the second half of 2002. Investment is expected   to   expand   4.2%   in   2003,   with   particular strength shown by investment in equipment. Provided  world  demand  recovers  as  assumed,  export growth is expected to rise strongly during 2002. Import growth  is  also  expected  to  recover  as  a  result  of  the better domestic scenario. All in all, the contribution of the external side to GDP growth is expected to remain marginally  negative  in  2002  and  to  worsen  slightly  in 2003. Labour market The deceleration of activity has had a significant impact on employment creation, which averaged only 2.0% in 2001  after  4.7%  in  the  preceding  year  (Labour  Force Survey data).  Employment growth is expected  to  slow to  1.0%  in  2002  and  to  revert  to  a  roughly  trend increase   of   2.2%   in   2003.   Despite   less   buoyant employment  growth,  the  increase  in  unemployment  in 2002 is expected to be limited and short-lived, with the average rate for the year close to  that of 2001, around 13%,with the  rate  falling further  to  12%  in 2003. The activity rate is expected  to  rise  only very  modestly by the end of the forecast period. The  increase  in  employee  compensation  per  full-time equivalent in 2002  is expected  to  fall  to  around  3.5%, due  to  a  weaker  labour  market  and  somewhat  better inflation performance than in 2001. The growth in unit labour   costs  is  similarly  expected   to   fall,   to   2.5% compared  to  3.9%  in  2001,  yielding  a  decline  in  real terms that would extend the trend observed in previous years.  Despite  the  recovery  of  employment  growth  in 2003,   a   further   moderation   of   compensation   per employee,  by 3.0%,  and  improved  productivity  would produce  a  further  deceleration  in  unit  labour  costs  to 1.9%,  and  real  unit  labour  costs  would  continue  to decline. Prices The  HICP  and  national  CPI  inflation  rates  averaged 3.2%   and   3.6%   in   2001,   respectively.   Despite   the relatively moderate behaviour of wages, price developments were worse than expected, mainly due to unprocessed  food  and  services.  On  the  other  hand, lower  energy  prices  in  the  second  half  of  the  year contributed to  a fall in headline inflation rates (energy prices  declined  on  a  year-on-year  basis  by  10%  in December). Core CPI inflation averaged 3.5% in 2001 with an  acceleration  in  the  second  half  of  the  year.  In 2002,  as  a  result  of  the  downturn  in  activity,  a  better performance of food components and moderate growth of  unit  labour  costs,  the  HICP  and  CPI  inflation  rates are expected to decrease to 3.0% and to ease further to 2.5%  in  2003.  On  the  other  hand,  core  inflation  is expected to show little change in 2002  compared  with 2001, though should moderate in 2003. External sector The current account deficit fell to 3.0% of GDP in 2001 from   3.4%   in   2000;   growth   of   merchandise   trade slumped. A significant recovery of exports of goods is expected  to  begin  in  the  second  quarter  of  2002  as  a result  of  stronger  world  demand,  with  a  subsequent recovery of imports of goods in the second half in line with the reinforced domestic activity. The upward trend is  expected  to  continue  in  2003  for  both  imports  and exports.   The   current   account   deficit   is   foreseen   to narrow further to around 2.5% as a result of gains in the terms of trade in 2002 and a growing services surplus in both 2002 and 2003. Public finances The  path  of  fiscal  consolidation  followed  in  recent years   continued   in   2001.   The   general   government budget  was  balanced,  compared  to  a  0.3%  deficit  in 2000, meeting the official target. This performance was based    partly   on   the    strength    of    social    security contributions and increased revenues from UMTS fees, but  principally  through  expenditure  restraint.  On  the other   hand,   the  economic   slowdown  contributed   to increase social transfers and to moderate the growth of tax revenue. In 2002 the slowdown will have a negative impact, with the budget balance forecast to return to  a moderate deficit of 0.2%. Several  factors contribute to avoid  a  stronger  deterioration:  first,  unlike  2001,  the indexation  of  pensions  in  2002  could  have  a  more moderate budgetary impact than in 2001 since inflation should  be  somewhat  lower.  Second,  interest  payments will continue to benefit from low interest rates. Finally, in  the  2002  budget,  income  tax  brackets  were  not adjusted for inflation, while VAT and excise duties on some  items  were  raised.  In  2003,  assuming  no  policy changes, the budget is forecast to return to balance. The debt-to-GDP   ratio   is   expected   to   continue   on   a declining path throughout the forecast period.		
May/2002	France	Economic activity is projected to accelerate markedly on the course of 2002	The economy in the second half of 2001 Economic activity continued decelerating in the second half of 2001, real GDP  growing  at an annualised  pace of 0.6%, its lowest rate since 1995. The main reason of this  slowdown  is  the   impact   on  final   demand   and business  confidence  of  the  global  slowdown  of  last year, the effects of which were amplified by the events of the 11th September 2001. The impact of these events on trade volumes was more pronounced than expected. Exports  and  imports  registered  their  sharpest  decline since quarterly national accounts were created in 1978. French  firms  reacted  rapidly  by  cutting  the  level  of stocks  (their  variation  contributed  negatively  to  real GDP  growth  by  1  percentage  point  over  the  last  two quarters of 2001), and by postponing investment plans. Conversely,  private  consumption remained  dynamic  in the  second  half  of  2001,  increasing  by  a  strong  3% annualised,  allowing  the  French  economy  to  avoid  an even more severe slowdown. Current situation and prospects Recent  converging  elements  suggest  that  real  GDP growth might have bottomed in the last quarter of 2001, when  it  decreased  by  0.1%.  Indeed,  business  surveys indices have been rising since November in all sectors of the economy. In the  manufacturing  industry,  output expectations, a key variable of the  survey, recorded  in December/January the highest cumulated increase since 1976.  Though  following  a  sharp  drop,  this  pick-up heralds  an  acceleration  in  industrial  production  in  the next few months. In the service sector, which represents two   thirds   of   the   economy,   the   deterioration   in confidence  observed  in  Q4-01  was  almost  completely reversed  in  Q1-02,  the  main  variables  of  the  survey being already back to a level close to long term average. On  the  consumer  side,  even  if  fear  of  unemployment continued  increasing,  confidence  stabilised  at  a  level slightly  higher  than  long  term  average,  after  declining continuously from January to October 2001. These   developments   show   that   the   sharp   drop   in confidence in the business sector  was short-lived. This scenario  is  largely  consistent  with  that  described  in Autumn by the Commission forecasts. It suggests that a significant  lift  in  real  GDP  growth  should  occur  from the first quarter of 2002. This rebound would reflect the influence   of   several   factors.   First,   along   with   the recovery in the world economy, export markets growth for France is expected to accelerate gradually from the first   quarter   of   2002.   Second,   monetary  and   fiscal easing resulting from past cuts in interest rates and the cumulated impact of fiscal automatic stabilisers and tax cuts  should  stimulate  economic  activity.  Last  but  not least,  the  decline  in  inflation  expected  in  next  Spring should  increase  the  purchasing  power  of  households, and thus favour private consumption, which remains the mainstay of the current phase of expansion. GDP components The  decline  in  exports  volumes  observed  in  2001  is projected   to   come   to   an   end,   thus   supporting   an improvement in demand expectations. Such a development  should  sustain  a  re-stocking  phase  in  the first semester of 2002. After eighteen months of relative stagnation,  productive  investment  should  re-accelerate in  the  second  part  of  2002,  when  the  improvement  in demand  prospects  will  be  confirmed  and  the  rate  of capacity utilisation resumes. The continued moderation in  the  cost  of  borrowing  should  also  contribute  to  the recovery in private investment. After the remarkable dynamism of the last three years, private   consumption   is   expected   to   experience   a temporary slowdown in early 2002, in parallel with the evolution  of  real  gross  disposable  income.  From  next Spring,  private  consumption  should  gradually  resume and  remain  firm  throughout  the  rest  of  the  forecast period. The  acceleration  in  private  spending  would  be favoured  by  the  implementation  of  tax  cuts  and  price moderation,  and,  later  in  the  year,  by  the  recovery  in employment growth. Labour market, costs and prices In   2001,   the   deterioration   in   economic   conditions impacted   the   labour   market:   employment   growth slowed from annualised 2.5% in the first half to below 1%   in   the   second.   In   the   next   few   quarters,   this evolution is expected  to  continue,  employment  growth becoming  virtually  nil  in  the  first  half  of  2002.  The slowdown   in   employment   growth   also   reflects   the gradual  fading  of  active  labour   market  policies.  In particular, the impact of the reduction in working time on  employment  creations  should  be  more  limited  in 2002  and  2003,  the  implementation  of  the  35  hours working  week  in  small  and  medium  companies  being more  gradual  than  in  large  ones.  The  increase  in  the unemployment  rate,  started  in  May  2001  after  three years of decline,  should  continue  until  the  end  of  next Spring, when the re-acceleration in economic activity is projected to trigger a rebound in employment growth. Wage  moderation is expected  to  continue in  2002  and 2003,  even  if  a  gradual  acceleration  at  the  end  of  the forecast period should be observed. In this context, unit labour costs should not constitute a major threat to price stability. The slight, and partly cyclical, acceleration in unit  costs  observed  in  2001  should  not  last.  Indeed, labour  productivity  is  projected  to  accelerate  over  the next two years, in a context where the labour deepening phenomenon observed since 1997 vanishes gradually. Against this background, underlying inflationary pressures   should   remain   limited.   Apart   from   wage moderation,  the  temperance  in  prices  will  also  reflect the  stabilisation  of  the  euro  and  the  normalisation  of energy and food prices. After a temporary acceleration in the first few months of 2002, overall inflation should decrease rapidly during 2002. Along with the economic recovery, inflation is expected to re-accelerate moderately in 2003, although remaining below 2%.

Economic Forecasts, Spring 2002 France 58 Public finances The slowdown in economic activity is fully reflected in the  projections  for  general  government  revenues.  The French  government  revised  upwards  its  estimation  for the 2001 general government deficit to 1.5% (excluding UMTS  revenues  worth  0.1  percentage  point  of  GDP), while  the  deficit  for  2002  is  now  expected  to  reach 1.8/1.9% of GDP and 1.7/1.8% of GDP in 2003 under macroeconomic    assumptions    comparable    to    those presented  here. The general  government  deficit  targets of the 2001 updated stability programme were 1.8% of GDP for 2002 and 1.5% of GDP in 2003 respectively. The  general  government  deficit,  estimated  at  1.5%  of GDP in 2001 (excluding UMTS revenues), is projected to  reach  2.0%  in  2002  (excluding  UMTS  revenues). This  projection  makes  the  assumption  that  nominal expenditures in 2002 will increase in line with the target fixed  in  the  2002  Finance  Law.  Given  that  inflation excluding  tobacco  will  be  1.3%  -  as  against  1.5% projected in the 2002 budget bill - this imply that real expenditures are projected to overrun the 2.2% growth target. In general, such an asymmetric behaviour of real expenditures  with  respect  to  expected  inflation  was observed  in  recent  years:  when  actual  inflation  turned out  to  be  lower  than  expected,  norms  were  overshot; yet,  the  reverse  happened  only  very  partially  when actual inflation was higher than expected. The  assumption  that   nominal   expenditures   will   not overshoot the limit implicit in the 2002 Finance Law is crucial   when   considering   that   significant   risks   of overspending exist in the health sector, that the impact of the change in unemployment benefit rules (PARE) is difficult to evaluate in the current period  of increasing unemployment,   and   that   costs   associated   with   the implementation of working time reduction in the public sector could well be higher than projected. In 2003, the general government deficit should decrease to   1.8%   of   GDP,   under   the   assumption   that   the objective for real expenditures set in the 2001 update of the  stability  programme  (+1.4%)   will  be   met.   The reduction  in  the  deficit  in  2003  is  dampened  by  two elements: (i) the implementation of the last step of the multi-annual plan of tax cuts decided in 2000 and (ii) a return towards more acceptable levels of the increase in non fiscal revenues.		
May/2002	Ireland	A sharp slowdown followed by recovery to sustainable growth	Output in 2001 Provisional national accounts data for 2000 show record real  GDP   growth  of  11.5%,   with  a   rapid   pace  of expansion  of  12.1%  year-on-year  in  the  final  quarter. Provisional quarterly data reveal annual GDP growth of 8.3%  in  the  first  three  quarters  of  2001.  Although impressive,   activity   actually   slowed   significantly   in 2001    under    the    combined    influence    of    supply constraints,   especially  labour   shortages,   and   several exogenous shocks (foot-and-mouth precautions, international slowdown and world-wide ICT retrenchment). While  official  seasonally-adjusted  GDP data are unavailable,  the  economy  is  expected  to  have contracted sharply in the third quarter of 2001. For the year  as  a  whole,  growth  was  probably  just  under  7%. With a carry-over from 2000 estimated at some 5%, the forecast incorporates little intra-year growth. Demand components in 2001 The  fundamental  determinants  of  private  consumption in   2001   were   high   growth   in   earnings   per   capita, significant   direct   tax   relief   and   a   healthy   rise   in employment.   Nonetheless,   falling   confidence   levels leading to a rise in the savings ratio after the big drop in 2000  and  a  normalisation  in  car  sales  after  record figures  in  the  preceding  year  contributed  to  a  sharply weaker   rate   of   expansion   than   in   2000.   Housing completions  continued  to  expand  firmly,  especially  in the social housing sector. Other construction is forecast to  have  grown  strongly  as  well,  as  implementation  of the National Development Plan progressed. By contrast, investment in equipment is expected to have shrunk in line   with   lower   business   confidence.   Merchandise exports   suffered   from   the   international   and   ICT slowdown   and   some   loss   in   competitiveness   after several   years   of   gains.   Merchandise   imports   were virtually  unchanged  from  the  level  in  2000,  a  strong indication  of  the  extent  to  which  economic  activity weakened.  Somewhat  surprisingly,  trade  in  services remained remarkably buoyant in 2001. Growth outlook Consumer and business surveys suggest that a rebound from  a  low  in  late-2001  is  underway.  The  purchasing managers'  indices  for  manufacturing  and  services  are recovering  steadily  from  a  trough  in  October  2001, although  the  former  continued  to  signal  contraction until  January.  The  forecast  assumes  that  the  recovery will  gather  pace  as  the  year  progresses,  but,  in  the absence of a significant positive carry-over from 2001, annual  growth  will  be  far  below  potential  in  2002. Private consumption is expected to show a healthy rate of expansion, given further direct tax relief in the most recent budget, very low real interest rates, wage growth around  8%  and  some  employment  gains.  In  line  with the   most   recent   budget,   public   consumption   and investment  are  also  forecast  to  grow  strongly.  Private house-building   activity   is   likely   to   benefit   from stimulatory  measures  in  the  budget,  while  growth  in equipment   investment   is   expected   to   recover   into positive  territory  as  a  result  of  improved  economic prospects.  Given  the  import-intensity  of  the  recovery, imports   growth   should   outstrip   exports   growth.   In contrast  to  the  recent  past,  the  contribution  to  growth from the external side is thus assumed to be negligible in  2002. For  2003,  the  projections  assume  that  the economy  will  attain  a  pace  of  expansion  around  that commonly  thought  to  be  sustainable  in  the  medium term, delivering growth of some 6%. Labour market The  steady  fall  in  unemployment  since  1996  finally came to a halt in early 2001, with the rate virtually flat to  mid-2001  at below 4%. Since then, a  moderate rise has been recorded, to a level slightly above 4% in 2002- Q1.  The  achievement  of  effectively  full  employment has  been  accompanied  by  growing  shortages  of  both skilled  and  unskilled  labour.  The  economic  slowdown is expected  to  lead  to  employment  growth  temporarily below  labour  force  growth  in  2002.  As  a  result,  the forecast  envisages  a  rise  in  the  unemployment  rate  in 2002 to 4½% and a similar level is projected for 2003. Wage developments The revised pay clause of the national agreement 2000- 2002,   the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF), provides for a 7.5% increase in basic pay from April (October) 2001 for the private (public) sector. The agreement  awards  another  4%  increase  for  the  nine months   from   April   (October)   2002   for   the   private (public)  sector  plus  a  1%  lump  sum  payment  in  April (October).  Negotiations  for  a  possible  new  agreement would take place in the latter half of 2002. The available evidence for 2001 points to a faster rise in average  earnings  than  in  2000,  although  the  weakness of personal income taxes through 2001 suggests that the downturn  has  produced  some  downward  flexibility  in the  rise  of  overall  compensation  of  employees.  The forecast assumes some drift above the PPF provisions, but  projects  a  gradual  downward  trend  to  2003.  This results,  on  the  one  hand,  from a  labour  market  that  is expected to remain largely supply-determined, coupled with  relatively  sticky  inflation  expectations.  On  the other   hand,   wages   in   the   exposed   sectors   of   the economy are  assumed  to  respond  more  flexibly to  the world-wide downturn, in order to safeguard competitiveness. However, the expected rise in average HICP inflation between 2001 and 2002 can be seen as a risk to this relatively benign outlook. Prices The improvement in HICP inflation in 2001, to 4.0% on average from 5.3% in 2000, was partly due to a reversal of one-off factors which drove up inflation in 2000 and partly  to  indirect  tax  cuts  implemented  by  the  budget for  2001.  However,  domestically-generated  pressures remained   strong   in   2001,   with   underlying   inflation (measured as the HICP minus energy, food, alcohol and Table 3.7 Main features of country forecast - IRELAND 2000 Annual percentage change bn Euro  Curr. prices % GDP 1981-97   1998   1999   2000   2001 2002   2003 GDP at constant prices 103.5 100.0 4.6 8.6 10.8 11.5 6.8 3.5 6.1 Private consumption 49.4 47.7 2.8 7.3 8.3 10.0 5.5 4.3 5.9 Public consumption 13.9 13.4 1.3 5.7 6.3 5.4 7.0 5.5 3.3 GFCF 24.4 23.6 2.9 15.7 13.5 7.3 1.3 2.4 3.6 of which : equipment 7.9 7.7 2.9 24.9 17.9 6.3 -4.8 2.5 3.5 Change in stocks as % of GDP 0.3 0.3 0.5 1.7 -0.1 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.1 Exports (goods and services) 98.2 94.9 10.5 21.4 15.7 17.8 8.2 5.5 10.0 Final demand 186.2 179.9 5.6 15.8 11.3 13.8 6.5 4.8 7.8 Imports (goods and services) 83.5 80.7 7.6 25.8 11.9 16.6 6.5 6.4 9.7 Contribution to GDP growth : Domestic demand 2.4 7.8 8.0 7.4 3.9 3.3 4.1 Stockbuilding 0.2 0.5 -1.8 0.5 -0.1 -0.1 0.0 Foreign balance 1.8 -0.3 5.0 3.7 2.9 0.2 2.0 Employment 1.0 8.6 6.0 4.7 2.9 1.0 2.1 Unemployment (a) 14.2 7.5 5.6 4.2 3.8 4.5 4.4 Compensation of employees/head 7.2 4.6 5.3 8.8 9.2 8.1 6.9 Unit labour costs 3.5 4.5 0.7 2.2 5.3 5.5 2.9 Real unit labour costs -1.7 -1.3 -3.3 -2.0 0.3 0.9 -0.8 Savings rate of households (b) - 12.0 12.8 11.4 13.1 13.5 12.9 GDP deflator 5.3 5.9 4.2 4.3 4.9 4.5 3.6 Private consumption deflator 5.3 3.5 3.4 4.6 4.5 4.4 3.3 Harmonised index of consumer prices - 2.1 2.5 5.3 4.0 4.5 3.3 Trade balance (c) 7.5 23.0 25.6 26.8 28.9 28.3 29.6 Balance on current transactions with ROW (c) -1.9 0.9 0.4 -0.6 -0.6 -1.4 -1.1 Net lending(+) or borrowing(-) vis à vis ROW (c) - 2.0 1.2 0.6 0.3 -0.7 -0.4 General government balance (c)(d) -5.3 2.3 2.3 4.5 1.7 0.6 0.2 General government gross debt (c) 95.8 55.1 49.6 39.0 36.3 33.6 31.4 (a) as % of civilian labour force.

Chapter 3 Member States Ireland 61 tobacco)  actually increasing  from 4.0%  in  H1-2001  to 4.9%   in   H2-2001.   For   2002,   the   Irish   authorities estimate  indirect  tax  rate  hikes  to  add  0.9  percentage points to the average CPI inflation rate. As a result, and despite the easing influence of the economic slowdown, average  HICP  inflation  in  2002  is  forecast  to  exceed last  year's  average.  In  2003,  however,  inflation  should ease while continuing to exceed the euro area average. The  uncertain  outlook  on  the  wage  front  constitutes  a risk  to  the  gradual  downward  trend  in  HICP  inflation that  is  assumed  to  occur  from  the  second  quarter  of 2002. Public finances A large tax  undershoot in 2001  is the  main reason  for the  decline  in  the  general  government  surplus  from 4.5%   in   2000   to   1.7%   in   2001.   Apart   from   the economic downturn and the impact of fiscal largesse in the  2001  budget,  this  may  be  partly  explained,  for indirect  taxes,  by  special  circumstances,  such  as  the steep   decline   in   revenue-intensive   car   sales   and extensive  restrictions  on  movement  (to  ward  off  foot- and-mouth  disease)  affecting  cross-border  trade.  The budget  for  2002  awards  some  further  direct  tax  relief for households and companies, the revenue implications of which are offset by a rise in several indirect tax rates and  a  gradual  advancement  of  the  date  of  payment  of corporation taxes. On the expenditure side, double-digit increases  are  budgeted  for  improving  the  quality  of public   service   provision  and   tackling  infrastructural needs.  Assuming  that  tax  revenues  behave  in  more predictable  ways  in  2002,  a  small  surplus  is  expected for  2002  (including  the  discounted  proceeds  of  the allocation of four UMTS licences, which is projected to yield some 0.2% of GDP). On a no-policy change basis (and   excluding   the   "contingency   provision   against unforeseen developments" of some 0.8% of GDP that is part of the 2003 budget target in the most recent update of Ireland's stability programme), the general government  balance  is  projected  to  decline  further  in 2003. Overall,  the state of the public  finances remains healthy, with the debt ratio expected to decline further towards slightly above 30% of GDP by 2003.		
May/2002	Italy	Cyclical turnaround to grow into full recovery in the second half of 2002	The economy in 2001 Economic growth suffered a marked slowdown over the course of the year. Following the sharp deceleration in the second quarter, economic output was slightly up in the  third  and  contracted  in  the   fourth.   Early  signs around mid-year pointing to a possible recovery before the end of 2001 were later on belied by the uncertainties originating  from  the  September  11 th events.  Thanks  to the strong kick-off in the first three months of the year, real  GDP  growth  was  1.8%  in  the  year  as  a  whole, slightly above the euro area average (1.6%). The economic deceleration was led by a weakening of net exports and investment expenditure. Compared with the  rest  of  the  euro  area,  Italian  exports  fared  slightly better in the first three months, but gave in more sharply afterwards   on   both   EU   and   third   markets.   The slowdown  in  investment  expenditure  largely  resulted from   a   sluggish   performance   of   private   business investment. In particular, expenditure on machinery and equipment other than cars was virtually flat in the year as  a  whole.  It  appears  that  the  announcement  early  in 2001 of the “Tremonti law”, a tax incentive scheme, led firms   to   postpone   investment   plans   followed   by   a further  deferral,  except  for  cars,  in  the  light  of  the worsened economic outlook in autumn.  Although  with a lag, private consumption was also hit by the cyclical slowdown   in   2001,   posting   a   decline   in   the   third quarter.   The   higher   than   expected   CPI   inflation, averaging  2.7% 2 ,  and  the  shock  to  confidence  after September 11 th prevailed over the positive performance of   the   labour   market.   Indeed,   employment   grew throughout  the  year,  though  at  a  slowing  rate.  A  pro- cyclical  labour  force  added  to  the  downward  trend  of the unemployment rate, which fell to 9.2% in October. Prospects Since  December  2001,  economic  surveys  as  well  as hard data have increasingly supported the view that the cyclical  downturn  reached  the  bottom  in  November. While being clearly positive, the evidence also suggests that the recovery of economic activity will be gradual in the  first  quarter  of  2002,  especially  on  account  of  the slow    recuperation    of    industrial    production.    The recovery  is  forecast  to  become  more  vigorous  around mid-year,  when  the  global  economic  environment  is assumed to strengthen. On the domestic side aggregate demand  will  be  reinforced  by  the  fiscal  measure  in support of private business investment. However, due to the   deceleration  at  the   end   of  2001,   the   statistical overhang of economic growth weighs on the annual rate of increase that can be achieved in 2002. In the year as a  whole  real  GDP  is  forecast  to  progress  by  1.4%, which, thanks to the assumed acceleration in the second half of the year, produces a favourable starting point for 2003, when GDP growth is forecast to rise to 2.7%. GDP components Private consumption is forecast to strengthen throughout  2002  on  account  of  several  elements,  the most   important   being   the   high   level   of   consumer confidence reached in the first few months of the year, ongoing   employment   creation   and,   to   some   extent, fiscal   policy   measures   in   support   of   low   income families.  By  contrast,  investment  expenditure  is  likely to remain sluggish at first as there is sufficient unused capacity to increase production in the first few months of the upturn. A clear change is expected in the second half of the year, when firms, considering the improved economic outlook, will try to take advantage of the tax incentive by bringing forward some of their investment plans.  On  the  external  side,  the  expected  increase  in exports  ensuing  from  the  recovery  of  world  demand will be more than compensated by imports, in particular in  view  of  the  traditionally  high  import  content  of investment expenditure.  Hence,  the contribution of  net exports  is  expected  to  turn  negative  in  2002,  before moving into the black again in 2003. Labour market Despite the economic slowdown in 2001,  employment continued to progress in the three months up to January 2002. The quarterly rate of increase actually accelerated compared with the previous three months producing an overhang of one full percentage point. Therefore, even assuming a lagged slowdown of employment growth in the remaining quarters of 2002, the rate of unemployment is unlikely to rise in the year as a whole. In   2003,   with   the   economic   recovery   expected   to steady, employment creation is finally forecast to regain strength  confirming  the  higher  job  content  of  growth observed in the recent past. The rate of unemployment is expected to fall below 9%. Costs and prices The  downward  trend  in  inflation,  in  progress  since April last year, was interrupted at the beginning of 2002 when the  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  rose  strongly in both January and February. Behind the sudden rise were mainly   one-off   effects   such   as   the   impact   of   the unusually cold weather on food prices and adjustments of   regulated   prices.   Underlying   cost   and   demand developments,   by   contrast,   are   expected   to   remain conducive  to  low  inflationary  pressure  throughout  the year. Nevertheless, in view of the adverse beginning to 2002, it is rather unlikely that CPI inflation falls below 2% in the year as a whole. In 2003 the renewal of wage agreements  of  some   employment  categories  usually acting  as  leaders  may  push  up  labour  costs.  However, thanks  to  a  parallel  increase  in  productivity,  this  will not feed through into consumer prices. However, as the output  gap  is  forecast  to  close  over  the  course  of  the recovery,   the   ensuing   demand   pressure   will   keep inflation from falling below 2% also in 2003. Public finances The net borrowing  of the  general  government  in  2001 was 1.4% of GDP, down from a revised figure of 1.7% (excluding  UMTS  proceeds)  in  2000,  but  higher  than the government’s earlier estimate of 1.1%. The primary surplus slightly increased compared to 2000 (excluding UMTS  proceeds).  The  government  debt  ratio  edged down from 110.6% of GDP in 2000 to 109.4%, higher than the original objective of 107.5%. The budgetary outcome in 2001 benefited from sales of public   real   estate   assets   (0.4%   of   GDP),   largely securitised,  and  from  the  securitisation  of  future  net proceeds  from  the  state  lottery  (0.2%  of  GDP).  If  the securitisation of  future  receipts  from the  state  lotteries as recorded by Italy were confirmed, revenues accruing from  lotteries  in  subsequent  years  would  be  reduced. This   is   reflected   in   the   Commission’s   forecasts. However,    the    government    deficit    in    2001    (and implications for future years) could be modified on the basis of the set of rules on the accounting treatment of securitisation,  on  which  Eurostat,  together   with  the Member States, is to decide by July 2002. The evaluation of legislation adopted in 2001 and of the Budget Law for 2002 leads to a deficit forecast of 1.3% of GDP in 2002, unchanged in 2003, in the absence of further policy measures. The primary surplus deteriorates   in   2002,   broadly   stabilising   in   2003. Interest  payments  are  estimated  to  continue  to  decline relative   to   GDP   over   the   forecast   period.   The   tax burden  (EU  definition)  decreases  in  both  years.  The debt ratio continues to decline slowly, reaching 105.6% of GDP at end-2003. Most   provisions   in   the   Budget   Law   for   2002   are subsumed in the forecast (higher current expenditure for pensions  and  public  sector  wages,  increases  in  family allowances, freeze in the implementation of some of tax reductions granted in 2000, extension of the tax on the voluntary  re-evaluation  of  company  assets).  However, savings    in    general    government    expenditures    are expected to be slightly lower than officially assumed. The   measures   encouraging   the   “surfacing”   of   the underground economy are assumed to increase revenues by 0.2% of GDP in 2002 (mostly the one-off effect   of   the   tax   and   social   security   contributions amnesty)  and  0.1%  of  GDP  in  2003,  similarly  to  the prudent  official  forecast.  The  tax  amnesty  on  capital assets   held   abroad   is   assumed   to   increase   capital revenue  in  2002  as  in  the  official  forecast.  The  tax incentive scheme to support investment is estimated to reduce  fiscal  revenues  by  0.3%  of  GDP  in  both  2002 and 2003, but also to induce higher tax receipts through somewhat stronger economic growth in 2002. The one- off impact on the budget from the securitisation of the sale of publicly-owned real assets matches the estimate in  the  November  2001  updated  Stability  programme (0.6%  of  GDP  in  2002  and  0.5%  in  2003),  given  the government’s  firm  commitment  to  achieve  such  sales. However,  while  the  remaining  property  of  the  social security    institutions    (0.3-0.4%    of    GDP)    is    well identified, identification and evaluation of other public real assets available for sale is still preliminary. There is therefore  a  risk  that  the  sales  may  not  yield  the  full expected  amounts  in  2002   and   especially  in  2003.		
May/2002	Luxembourg	Activity remained buoyant in 2001 but is expected to decelerate to 2003	The economy in 2001 Real GDP growth was extremely strong in Luxembourg in recent years, reaching 7.5% in 2000 and 7% in yearly average over the period 1997-2000. However, economic   activity   decelerated   progressively   in   the course  of  2001,  especially  in  the  second  half  of  the year,  along   with  the   general  slowdown  in  the   EU economy;  but  yearly  GDP  growth  still  amounted  to some  5.1%.  Industrial  production  rose  by 4%  (against 5.1%  in  2000)  but  this  still  solid  increase  was  mostly due   to   two   enterprises   the   production   of   which expanded spectacularly. Construction slowed significantly   down   with   respect   to   2000   and   most branches of market services, notably financial services also  showed  signs  of  deceleration  in  the  course  of  the year. On   the   contrary,   retail   trade   remained   dynamic, reflecting   buoyancy   in   private   consumption,   which increased by 3.4% in volume as against 3.1% in 2000, boosted by still strong employment creation in the first half  of  the  year,  by  the  acceleration  in  wages  and  by large cuts in income tax implemented at the beginning of the year. Government consumption rose by 4.6% in real terms, hardly less than in the previous  year. Total investment increased  by 5.9%  in  volume,  while  it  had decreased  in  2000  for  incidental  reasons.  Exports  rose by  about  8%,  mostly  driven  by  exports  of  services, which  increased  by  10%  in  volume,  but  exports  of goods remained more dynamic than expected, increasing  by  4.5%.  Imports  rose  slightly  faster  than exports,  imports  of goods  being  sustained  by dynamic consumption and investment. Prospects Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate in the course of 2002 but, due to a much smaller overhang at the end of  2001  than  one  year  before,  the  yearly  average  will most  probably  be  significantly  lower  than  last  year. Private  consumption  should  remain  dynamic  both  in 2002  and  2003,  despite  the  expected  slowdown  in  job creation, due to still rapidly rising wages and a second step   of   cuts   in   income   tax,   entered   into   force   on 1 st January 2002. Government consumption will probably  continue  to  rise  rather  fast,  like  in  recent years.  Investment  should  slow  significantly  down  and will probably even decrease in volume in 2002, despite government  investment  projected  to  rise  by  more  than 5% in real terms. As usual in Luxembourg, these large fluctuations  in  total  investment  are  caused  by  huge swings in equipment investment; due to the size of the country, a few large projects or even a single one may result  in  dramatic  fluctuations  in  investment  growth. However, as equipment is for a large part imported, the effect  on  real  GDP  growth  is  much   more   limited. Exports, especially exports of goods, will probably slow considerably  down  from  the  still  high  rate  of  increase recorded  in  2001,  but  so  should  imports,  due  to  the projected decline in investment in equipment. All in all, real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  reach  about  3%  in 2002,  much  less  than  in  recent  years  but,  due  to  the dynamism  in  consumption  (both  public  and  private), significantly more than in neighbouring countries. Real GDP growth will probably accelerate in the course of 2002 and in yearly average in 2003: not only should exports  follow  the  recovery  in  international  trade,  but domestic demand  might  also  grow  faster  than in 2002 due  to  an  expected  recovery  in  investment.  Imports should  also  reaccelerate,  reflecting  the  faster  rise  in domestic demand, especially in equipment investment. Employment and unemployment Employment   kept   rising   fast   in   2001,   by   5.7%, marginally  more  than  in  2000  (5.6%).  However,  it decelerated over the year from a record 6.8% year-on- year rise registered in January. Like in previous  years, the  largest  share  of  job  creation  (about  70%  in  2001) went  to  non-residents,  which  represent  now about  one third  of  total  employment.  However,  despite  this  still strong  increase  in  employment,  unemployment  started to rise again in the second part of the year. As a result, the  unemployment  rate  in  the  whole  year  remained  at the same level as in 2000 (2.6%). Employment growth should slow down considerably in 2002, while remaining much faster than in neighbouring countries. It will probably recover in 2003 but significantly less than GDP, reflecting the usual lag between  fluctuations  in  activity  and  in  employment. Unemployment  should  continue  to  increase  during  the largest  part  of  the  forecast  period,  since  job  creation will   not   reach   the   rather   fast   pace   which   seems necessary to keep it constant. Moreover, as unemployment will also rise (and probably even more) in the regions surrounding Luxembourg, the competition  will  intensify  between  residents  and  non- residents, whose reservation wage is probably significantly lower. However, the rise in unemployment should   remain   limited,   at   least   because   a   growing number  of  persons  will  probably  be  absorbed  in  the specific  programmes  that  the  Luxembourg  authorities have already implemented to put unemployed at  work. The number of people subject to these measures rose by 15% in 2001. Costs and prices Price inflation had significantly accelerated in 2000 for a  large  part  due  to  the  rise  in  oil  prices.  It  slowed significantly down  in 2001  for  symmetric  reasons,  the annual rise in the HICP declining from 3.8% in 2000 to 2.4%, while the national CPI decelerated from 3.2% to 2.7%. However, underlying inflation accelerated, due to the  lagged  effects  of  the  rise  in  oil  prices  and  of  the wage    indexation    mechanism.    This    slowdown    in consumer price inflation should continue in 2002 but a slight  acceleration  might  occur  in  2003,  following  the forecast rise in the price of oil. Wage  increase  remained  more  or  less  in  line  with developments  in  neighbouring  countries  until  the  first semester  of  2000.  Then,  it  accelerated  significantly reaching   3.9%   in   2000   and   about   5.3%   in   2001, significantly    higher    than    the    EU    average.    This acceleration   is   probably   mostly   attributable   to   the automatic  indexation  of  wages  on  consumer  prices. Wage  increase  might  well  slow  down  in  2002  before accelerating slightly again in 2003, reflecting developments in the CPI. Public finance Strong  activity  had  boosted  government  revenues  in 2000  to  the  point  that  the  general  government  surplus had reached 5.8% of GDP, despite a rather fast rise in expenditure.   In   2001,   the   increase   in   government current   revenues   slowed   considerably   down,   from 12.6%  in  2000  to  5.3%:  receipts  from  indirect  taxes rose by a modest 1.2% as against 15.3% in 2000, while a first round of cuts in income tax was implemented, the ex-ante cost of which for public finance was estimated at  1.1%  of  GDP.  On  the  contrary,  the  rise  in  current expenditure  accelerated  from  7.4%  in  2000  to  10.8%, essentially   due   to   a   fast   increase   in   government consumption  and  social  transfers.  Moreover,  general government  investment  rose  by  14.6%.  Nevertheless, the  general  government  surplus  declined  only to  5.0% of  GDP,  due  to  the  proceeds,  amounting  to  1.9%  of GDP,  of  the  extension  of  a  concession  granted  to  the satellite company ASTRA. In   2002,   on   the   contrary,   the   general   government surplus should decrease significantly, due to the effects of the slowdown in activity but also to a second round of cuts in income tax as well as a reduction in corporate tax,  amounting ex-ante respectively to  1.8%  and  1.5% of GDP. In 2003, the surplus should increase again as a result  of  the  acceleration  in  activity  and  its  effects  on revenues.		
May/2002	Netherlands	Abrupt deceleration in 2001, slow recovery in 2002, strengthening in 2003	The economy in 2001 From the 1993 recession to 2000, the Dutch real GDP grew  by  3%  or   more  in  all  years  but  1995.  This exceptional  period  came  abruptly  to  an  end  at  the beginning of 2001, when real GDP growth was null in the 1st quarter, recovered only slightly in the 2 nd quarter (+0.3%) and was null again in the last two quarters. The Dutch economy was thus on the verge of a recession in the  2 nd semester  of  the  year  and  yearly  GDP  growth reached only 1.1% as against 3.5% in 2000. Like  in  most  other  EU  countries,  the  slowdown  in activity   chiefly   resulted   from   the   deceleration   in international trade: both exports and imports, which had been rising by more than 2% in quarterly figures up to the end of 2000, fell abruptly and simultaneously from the 1st quarter of 2001. However,   other   factors   also   played   a   role   in   this slowdown:  private  consumption  fell  by  0.8%  quarter- on-quarter in the 1st quarter, despite still rapidly rising employment, fast increasing wages and a supplementary  boost  given  to  disposable  income  by large cuts in income taxes and social contributions paid by households, implemented  as part of a  wide-ranging fiscal reform entered into force on 1 st January. Actually, households  had  anticipated  much  more  than  generally expected  the  rise  in  VAT  which  was  part  of  the  same tax    reform    and    had    massively    brought    forward purchases  of  durable  goods  in  the  latest  months  of 2000.  Private  consumption  recovered  somewhat  from the  2d  quarter,  growing  by  nearly  0.7%  quarter-on- quarter on average in the last three quarters of the year but   at   a   decelerating   pace,   reflecting   probably   the decline  in  consumers  confidence  resulting  from  the slowdown in activity. Private investment started to decrease in the 3 rd quarter of 2000 and declined further all along 2001, falling by more than 2% in yearly terms, investment in equipment collapsing by more than 4%. Inventories decreased only slightly over the year but fell by more than 1 percentage point of GDP in the 4 th quarter of 2001, explaining for a large   part   the   decline   in   domestic   demand   at   that moment.  However,  in  terms  of  real  GDP  growth,  this fall was partially compensated by an even bigger drop in  imports.  Actually,  the  main  support  to  growth  in 2001 came from public spending, government consumption   and   investment   rising   year-on-year   by 3.4%  and  5.1%  respectively  and  contributing  together for   0.9%   to   GDP   growth,   significantly   more   than private consumption or exports (0.6% each). Prospects After  the  incidental  fall  at  the  beginning  of  2001, private consumption should continue to recover in 2002 and 2003 but only progressively: slow job creation and rising unemployment will partially offset the effects of fast rising wages and of the large increase in disposable income  which  occurred  in  2001  (resulting  until  now mostly in additional  saving).  Due  to  slowly improving demand and to the deterioration in profitability caused by the fast increase in wages in recent  years, recovery in private investment should only effectively materialise  at  the  end  of  2002  or  in  2003.  On  the contrary, stocks might pick up rather promptly after the big fall registered in the 4 th quarter of 2001 and perhaps bring real GDP growth back in positive territory already at the beginning of 2002. Exports  should  begin  to  rise  again  in  the  course  of 2002, perhaps already in the 1 st quarter, in line with the recovery  in  international   trade.   However,   they   will probably increase significantly slower than total market growth  due  to  deteriorating  external  competitiveness resulting   from   fast   wage   increases.   Imports   will probably recover faster than exports, due to the earlier acceleration  in  domestic  demand.  In  total,  real  GDP should  accelerate  only  modestly  in  yearly  average  in 2002  and  more  significantly  in  2003,  rising  by  about 1½% and 2¾% respectively. Employment and unemployment Employment  was  very  dynamic  in  recent  years,  rising by 2½% a year on average from 1995 to 2000. It kept increasing rapidly in the first half of 2001, slowed down in the second but still grew by slightly more than 2% in yearly  average;  this  means  that  GDP  per  occupied person  declined  by  about  1%.  This  substantial  labour hoarding probably resulted from the sudden character of the    slowdown    in    activity    and    from    its    widely unexpected sharpness but also  from the  fact that firms were certainly reluctant to lay off employees taking into account  the  acute  problems  they  had  faced  in  hiring staff in recent years (the number of vacancies has been higher than recorded unemployment since the Summer of    2000    and    still    remains    so,    while    declining significantly in recent months). Employment  should  rise  only  modestly  in  2002,  by about  ½%,  and  a  somewhat  faster  in  2003,  by around 1%.   Consequently,   unemployment,   which   remained stable   until   the   end   of   2001,   contrarily   to   most expectations,  will  eventually  begin  to  rise  in  2002.  It should stop increasing and even begin to decline before the  end  of  the  forecasting  period  but,  as  its  decline  in 2003 is likely to be slower than its rise in 2002, it will probably still increase in yearly average next  year, the Eurostat  harmonised  rate  rising  to  some  3.3%  from 2.4% in 2001 and 2.9% in 2002. Costs and prices Due  to  strong  job  creation,  falling  unemployment  and the  ensuing  rising  tensions  on  the  labour  market,  the increase  in  wages  accelerated  significantly  in  recent years,  from  1.4%  in  1996  to  about  4½%  in  2001.  It should  decelerate  only  marginally  during  the  forecast period as the increase in unemployment should remain rather  limited  and  its  level  comparatively  low,  while inflation will probably slow down only gradually. Inflation had remained moderate up to 1999 but, partly as    a    result    of    rising    oil    prices,    it    accelerated significantly in the course of 2000, reaching 3% at the end   of   the   year.   It   speeded   up   even   more   at   the beginning of 2001, partly because of a rise from 17.5% to 19% in the standard VAT rate which was part of the fiscal  reform.  For  the  whole  year,  the  HICP  rose  by 5.1%  and  the  national  CPI  by 4.5%  against  2.3%  and 2.5%  respectively  in  2000.  Wages  still  rising  rapidly, the deceleration in inflation should be only progressive over  the  forecast  period,  both  indexes  increasing  by about  3¼%  to  3½%  this  year  and  2¼%  to  2½%  next year. Public finance The  general  government  surplus  had  reached  1.5%  of GDP  in  2000  (2.2%  including  revenues  from  UMTS licences) but fell to around 0.2% in 2001 due to a series of factors: the large tax cuts operated  at the beginning of  the  year  and  amounting ex ante to  0.7%  of  GDP, additional  spending  decided  in  the  Spring  for  about 0.7% of GDP (but compensated by lower than projected interest   payments   and   social   security   outlays),   the purchase by the State of the  stake of the  firm DSM in the energy concern EBN for another 0.3% of GDP and also  the  slowdown  in  activity,  which  resulted  in  the latest  months  of  the  year  in  significant  shortfalls  in taxes and social contributions. The   surplus   should   fall   to   about   zero   this   year, following  new  tax  cuts  (albeit  for  a   much  smaller amount  than  in  2001)  and  additional  expenditure  for about 0.8% of GDP decided in the 2002 budget, but al so  due  to  slow  economic  growth  and  an  increase  in unemployment  outlays.  With  unchanged  policy,  rising unemployment   spending   and   the   lagged   effect   of economic slowdown on some tax receipts should  even result in a small deficit in 2003. This should not prevent the debt ratio from continuing to decline, but at a slower pace than in recent years, from 52.9% in 2001 to around 50% in 2002 and to about 47½% in 2003		
May/2002	Austria	Sluggish domestic demand in 2002 to accelerate in 2003	The economy in 2001 Economic  activity  in  2001  slowed  considerably  from the buoyancy in 2000. This was caused by a sharp fall in    domestic    demand    growth    while    the    growth contribution of the external sector improved, reflecting basically a slump in import growth. In comparison with the   previous   year,   growth   of   private   consumption halved,   to   1¼   %,   as   real   disposable   income   of households    declined    under    the    impact    of    weak employment  growth,  higher  than  anticipated  inflation and a rise in income taxes. Investment took a dive, with construction  suffering  from  oversupply  and  budgetary restraint,   while   equipment   investment   plunged   in   a context  of  deteriorating  demand  expectations.  Export growth   proved   surprisingly  resilient   in   the   face   of sluggish external demand, thanks partially to significant improvements  in  external  competitiveness  over  recent years which helped gain market shares. Overall, at 1% output  growth  came  in  2 percentage  points  below  the rate of the previous year. Prices increased at the beginning of the year but, as oil prices  fell  and  other  special  factors  faded  (e.g.  excise tax increases), started to fall towards the middle of the year.   The   weak   output   growth   reversed   the   trend decline  in  unemployment  observed  in  previous  years, with    the    unemployment    rate    staying    nonetheless significantly below the average of the EU15. Prospects Economic activity in 2002 is influenced by the slack in world economic growth and sluggish domestic demand. Private  and  public  consumption  will  continue  to  be curbed  by  slow  employment  growth  and  budgetary restraint.  Investment  is  projected  to  pick  up  only  by mid-2002, thus delaying an upswing. Export growth in 2002  is  likely  to  slow  further,  at  least  on  an  annual average,  with  the  first  half  of  the  year  expected  to record particularly low growth rates. As a result, output growth  in  2002  is  expected  to  remain  more  or  less steady at below 1¼ with domestic demand offsetting a further decline in export growth. A full reversal of this is  only  expected  in  2003,   when  a   revival  of  both external trade and domestic demand should bring output expansion close to a rate of 2½%. Demand components In  2002,  households’  disposable  income  should  again expand,   if   moderately,   thanks   to   decelerating   price increases   and   the   introduction   of   a   new   childcare allowance. However, a less benign employment outlook will  partly  counter  this  effect.  As  a  result,   private consumption  is  expected  to  accelerate  only  slightly  in 2002 before recovering more vigorously in 2003. Public consumption  is  projected  to  fall  again  in  2002  due  to budgetary  consolidation,  before  expanding  moderately in 2003. Construction investment is projected to bottom out  towards  the  end  of  2002,  with  a  slight  expansion foreseen in 2003. Equipment investment is expected to pick  up  by  mid-2002  reflecting  the  improvement  in demand conditions. Due to sluggish external demand in the  first  half  of  the  year,  on  an  annual  average  export growth  is  projected  to  decelerate  in  2002,  but  with import  growth  declining  as  well  net  exports  should continue to contribute positively to GDP growth, albeit somewhat less than a year before. Exports are expected to  gain  momentum  from  mid-2002  onwards,  coming into  full  swing  in  2003.  With  imports  also  surging, reflecting the expected pick-up in domestic demand, the contribution  of  net  exports  to  GDP  growth  should  be close to neutral in 2003. Prices and Wages In 2002, the assumed lower oil price and the easing of other import prices should have a moderating impact on consumer prices. With the effect of this vanishing and activity  reviving  a  gentle  increase  in  price  inflation should   be   expected   in   2003.   The   collective   wage bargaining round in the private sector points towards a nominal  increase  in  contract  wages  somewhat  below that   of   2001.   Owing   also   to   the   more   favourable inflation  outlook,  this  implies  a  slight  increase  in  real wages.  In  2003,  despite  the  cyclical  upswing  wage moderation in the private sector is expected to continue, leading to only slightly higher wage settlements than in 2002.  In  the  public  sector,  by  contrast,  as  the  agreed pay-rise for the period 2001-02 was very moderate and entailed significant losses in real terms, and given that 2003  is  an  election  year,  prospects  are  for  noticeable higher  wage  demands.  In  sum,  wage  growth  in  2003 should be somewhat above that in 2002. Labour market The  slack  in  output  growth  in  2002  is  expected  to impact  negatively  on  the  labour   market,   with  total employment   expected   to   fall.   Dependent   labour   is nevertheless projected to expand slightly in 2002 while a more sustained pick-up should be expected for 2003. The  gentle  decline  in  self-employment  is  expected  to continue   over   the   whole   forecasting   period.   Total employment growth is thus expected to resume in 2003. Labour supply is subject to partly offsetting tendencies related to changes in social security legislation and the introduction of a new childcare allowance. Overall, the activity  rate  is  projected  to  increase  slightly  over  the forecast  period.  Reflecting  the  projected  tendencies  of labour demand  and  supply, unemployment  is  expected to continue to rise in 2002 before starting to fall again in 2003. Current account The  current  account  deficit  is  expected  to  narrow  in 2002  due  basically  to  weak  domestic  demand.  This  is particularly reflected  in  a  declining  trade  deficit  under the impact of slowing import growth. In 2003, despite a relatively  stable  services  surplus  the  projected  rise  in the growth rate of imports of goods should again lead to a widening of the current account deficit. Public finances In   2001,   budgetary   consolidation   was   impressive. General  government  finances  improved  from  a  deficit of 1.5% of GDP in 2000 (excluding UMTS proceeds) to asmallsurplusof0.1% 3 . As this was achieved against low  output  growth  the  improvement  in  the  cyclically- adjusted  position  was  even  stronger.  Austria  therefore achieved  the  goal  of  a  budget  close  to  balance  or  in surplus one year ahead of the target set in the updated stability  programme  of  2000.  The  favourable  outcome in  2001  was  due  mainly  to  a  strong  increase  in  tax income,  which  exceeded  expectations,  reflected  in  a sharp  increase  in  the  tax  burden  to  more  than  45%  of GDP. Although a new childcare allowance was introduced as of   January,    the    budget   2002    implies    significant restraint. Expenditure growth is projected to be kept at bay  thanks  to  the  continued  effects  of  the  pension 3 Eurostat is currently not in a position to certify the figures included in the Spring 2002  notification of Austria  under the  excessive  deficit  procedure (according   to   Council   regulation   n°   3605/93,   amended   by   Council regulation n° 475/2000); among other reasons  uncertainties  are  related  to the attribution of taxes collected in 2001 but due in previous years. reform and the ongoing administrative reform. Although   government   spending   in   percent   of   GDP should fall significantly, the slack in output growth and projected  revenue  shortfalls  from  unsettled  tax  claims linked  to  higher  prepayments  in  2001  are  expected  to deteriorate  government  finances  to  a  small  deficit  of 0.1% of GDP. In 2003, by contrast, the expected  cyclical  upswing  in combination  with  the  continued  impact  of  structural expenditure   savings   should   again  result   in   a   small budgetary surplus. This forecast is, however, based on a no-policy-change assumption, taking into account only measures  decided  at  the  cut-off  date  (e.g.  the  planned reduction in non-wage labour cost is not included).		
May/2002	Portugal	Correction of macro-economic imbalances delays upswing	The economy in 2001 In the first 3 quarters of 2001 GDP is estimated to have grown by around 2% compared with the same period of 2000.  With  output  growth  likely  to  have  decelerated also  in  the  fourth  quarter,  the  annual  growth  rate  is estimated at some 1¾%, implying a sharp deceleration in   the   pace   of   economic   activity   from   the   period 1999-2000.  This  was  due  to  a  rapid  decline  in  the growth  contribution  of  domestic  demand  which  was only  partly  offset  by  an  improvement  in  the  external contribution. In particular, growth of private consumption  saw  a  strong  downturn  and  investment growth  is  expected  to  have  declined  by  about  ½%, reflecting  a  weakening  in  residential  construction  and business  investment.  Public  investment,  by  contrast, picked  up  partly  due  to  a  catch-up  effect  following teething  problems  with  the  new  Community  Support Framework  in  2000  and  an  investment  cycle  due  to local  elections.  Export  growth  is  estimated  to  have slowed from some 8% in 2000 to about 3½% in 2001, in tandem with the decline in export market growth. At the same time, import growth fell from 5¾% in 2000 to near   stagnation   in   2001   as   a   result   of   weakening domestic    demand.    In    net    terms, therefore, the contribution  of  the  external  sector  to  output  growth improved to about 1% of GDP. Inflation   was  pushed   up   in  2001   by  a  number   of temporary   factors,   such   as   the   oil   price   hike   and increases   in   non-processed   food   prices.   Although inflationary pressures started to subside from the second quarter  of  2001  onwards,  the  annual  average  increase amountedto4.4%. Employment grew by a strong 1.6% in 2001. Due to a concomitant rise in the labour force, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at about 4%. Outlook While the first half of 2002 should see a further decline in  economic  activity,  a  moderate  pick-up  is  expected from  the  second  half  of  2002  onwards,  reflecting  the assumption  of  favourable  developments  in  the  world economy. However, in view of the negative overhang at the  beginning  of  the  year,  on  an  annual  average  GDP growth is expected  to  reach only 1½% in 2002  before reviving  to  an  annual  growth  rate  of  some  2¼%  in 2003.  Domestic  demand  is  forecast  to  grow  by  about ¾ %  in  2002  before  picking  up  to  about  2%  in  2003. The subdued growth of domestic demand, especially in 2002,  is  mainly  due  to  continued  efforts  of  private sector agents to redress their balance sheets, following the  sharp  rise  in  indebtedness  levels  in  recent  years. While   export   growth   is   expected   to   revive   in   the forecast period imports will also pick up, resulting in a decline in the growth contribution of net exports. GDP components Private consumption  is  expected  to  remain  subdued  in 2002-03  as  consumer  confidence  is  currently  low  and the  households’  saving  rate  is  assumed  to  stabilise  at around  13%  of  gross  disposable  income  after  having reached  a  historically  low level  in  1999.  In  particular, consumption  of  durable  goods,  especially  vehicles,  is expected  to  remain  weak,  reflecting  saturation  effects and the impact of changes in indirect taxes. Total   investment   is   forecast   to   grow   by   1¼%   on average   in   2002-03.   Investment   in   construction   is expected   to   be   affected   by   continued   weakness   in residential construction which, following a normalisation in the level of capital  transfers  from the Community Support Framework, should be progressively   offset   by   higher   public   investment. Investment in equipment is expected to remain subdued in the  first half of 2002, due to a low rate  of capacity utilisation  and  a  weak  profitability  of  enterprises,  but should strengthen by mid-2002, reflecting the improvement in the international environment. Due to a strong negative statistical overhang, the sharp deceleration  in  export  growth  in  2001  is  expected  to affect  export  growth  also  in  2002.  As  export  market growth progressively gathers pace, reaching about 6½% in 2003, total export growth is projected to recover over the  forecast  period.  The  total  import  elasticity  of  final demand  is  estimated  to  decline  in  2001  and  in  2002, because  of  the  marked  slowdown  in  the  demand  for durables  with  a  high  import  content.  With  the  gradual revival of investment and exports, the import elasticity should edge up again at the end of the forecast period. Overall, the contribution of net exports to output growth is forecast to be about ½ percentage point in 2002 and ¼ percentage point in 2003. External Balance A sizeable external deficit, as measured by the sum of the current and the capital balance, is the counterpart of the strong  increase  in  private  sector  indebtedness  over recent years. A gradual adjustment process has set in as witnessed by the decline in domestic demand. Although this process should act to narrow the external deficit, it is  likely  to   be   slow.   As  a   result,   and   despite   the expected  normalisation in the level of  capital  transfers from the Community Support Framework, the external deficit is projected to decline only mildly from 8½% of GDP in 2001 to about 7% in 2003. Prices Due  to  the  disappearance  of  temporary  factors,  which increased price pressures in 2000 and at the beginning of   2001,   inflation   is   on   a   decelerating   trend.   As domestic   demand   is   expected   to   remain   subdued, inflation  is  projected  to  pursue  its  slowdown  over  the forecast  period,  attaining  an  annual  average  close  to 2½% in 2003. Labour Market Employment growth is forecast to slow down to about ¼%   per   year   in   the   forecast   period,   whereas   the unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  rise  to  about  5%  in 2003. The  easing  of  labour  market  tensions  combined with the expected decline in inflation, together with the favourable  spill-over  effects  from  comparatively  low wage  agreements  in  the  public  sector,  should  have  a dampening  effect  on  wage  increases  in  the   private sector.  As  a  result,  total  wage  growth  is  expected  to decelerate from about 5¾% in 2001 to 3¾% in 2003. Public finances The February 2002 EDP notification by the Portuguese authorities estimated  the general government deficit in 2001  at  2¼  %  of  GDP. 4 In  the  meantime,  following additional  information  on  certain  capital  transactions between    the    government    and    public    enterprises, Eurostat reclassified some of these operations as capital transfers  rather  than  as  capital  injections,  resulting  at this stage in an upward revision of around ¼ % of GDP. 4 Eurostat was not  in a position to certify this  figure of Portugal  under the excessive  deficit  procedure  (according  to  Council  regulation  n°  3605/93, amended   by   Council   regulation   n°   475/2000);   among   other   reasons uncertainties were related to capital transfer to public enterprises. In    addition,    official    estimates    of    the    borrowing requirement  of  local  authorities  in  2001  were  revised upwards by ¼  % of GDP. As a consequence, the  new estimate  for  the  2001  deficit,  based  on  the  available information at the cut-off date of the  forecast, is 2.7% of GDP. Regarding the year 2002, the deficit estimate  for 2002 is  based  on  the  initial  2002  budget  and,  taking  into account  the  worse  point  of  departure,  centred  around 2½ % of GDP. The new government, which took office in  early  April,  announced  plans  to  amend  the  current budget trough a supplementary budget to be  presented in May.		
May/2002	Finland	Subdued growth in 2002 followed by a recovery in 2003	Economy in 2001 The  Finnish  economy  experienced  a  severe  slowdown in  2001,  after  seven  years  of  robust  growth  averaging more  than  4%  per  year.  Real  GDP  grew  by  a  modest 0.7%,  down  from  5.6%  in  2000.  The  slowdown  was mainly due to a collapse in global export demand which also led to a vast de-stocking. The growth contribution from  net  exports  fell  to  zero  as  exports  and  imports decreased  by  0.7%  and  1.0%,  respectively.  Growth came  thus  exclusively  from  the  domestic  side,  with domestic demand expanding by 0.8%. Private consumption   grew   by   1.4%,   although,   with   real disposable  income  of  households  increasing  by  2.9%, the savings rate levelled upwards. Government consumption  rose  by  1.7%  due  mostly  to  a  rise  in expenditure   of  local   governments.   Total   investment strengthened    by   2.1%    although    the    pattern    was somewhat mixed since construction investment fell due to poor housing construction whereas other construction still    improved.    Equipment    and    other    investment, however, continued to lift overall investment expenditure. Unemployment averaged 9.1% of the total labour force in 2001, down from 9.8% in 2000. This owed to a still favourable employment growth of 1.2% of which most came    from   the    service    sector,    particularly    from financial    and    public    services.    The    labour    force participation  rate  improved  by  0.2  pp.  to  an  annual average  of  66.7%.  Inflation  (HICP)  eased  gently  to 2.7%  as  shocks  from  higher  prices  of  oil  and  housing faded  towards the end  of the  year. However, prices of services continued to uphold inflation. Prospects Against the background of negative GDP growth in the fourth  quarter  of  2001  some  rebound  effects  can  be expected  in  the  first  quarter  of  2002.  Nevertheless, economic indicators  point  to  moderate  growth  rates  in the  first  half  of  2002.  Therefore,  GDP  is  expected  to gain  momentum  only  from  summer  on  in  step  with improved  external  demand.  As  a  result,  real  GDP  is forecast  to  grow  by  a  moderate  1½%  on  average  in 2002. In 2003, a nnual average growth should pick up to close to 3 ¼%. Under  the  forecast  profile  of  moderate  output  growth, employment  creation  will  be  modest  in  2002  and  will be  concentrated  in  the  service  sector  –  particularly  in public services. Employment growth will be dampened also   by   a   further   increase   in   regional   and   skill mismatch. Consequently, a small rise in unemployment is forecast for 2002. This is likely to be accentuated by an  increase  in  the  labour  market  inflow  of  persons currently outside the  work  force (students, housewives etc.) which will raise the participation rate slightly. The projected rise in unemployment would be even higher if it   were   not   for   the   labour-hoarding   behaviour   of employers preparing to face labour shortages as a result of   the   baby   boom   generation   beginning   to   retire. Unemployment  is  expected  to  resume  its  downward trend  in 2003  along  with the  acceleration  in  economic activity. GDP components Finland is one of the countries most exposed to global developments   in   the   ICT   sector.   Due   to   the   poor performance  of  this  sector  in  combination  with  soft global demand, exports will most likely stagnate in the first half of 2002 followed by a rebound in the second half as global conditions improve. In 2003, thanks to a still  good  price  competitiveness  of  Finnish  exporters and to the expected boost from third generation mobile technology  investment,   net  exports  are   expected   to boost   GDP   growth   by   nearly   1½   pp.   Consumer spending  in  2002  should  be  supported  by  continued income   tax   cuts   and   an   expected   moderation   in inflation. However, the positive impact of these factors might  be  dampened  by  the  expected  mild  increase  in unemployment. In 2003, improving employment conditions and higher wage rises are expected to result in a slight acceleration of private consumption growth. Owing  to  a  low capacity  utilisation  rate  and  the  weak export demand, business investment is expected to stay relatively  weak  in  2002  but  should  start  to  pick  up gradually  by  mid  2003,  along  with  improved  demand prospects and as financing conditions remain favourable. A higher vacancy rate for business premises coupled  with a decline in the demand  for housing will hold   back   construction   investment   throughout   the forecast period. Costs and prices Although  economic  activity  is  expected  to  gradually pick  up,  lower  energy  and  food  prices  should  reduce price   pressures   throughout   2002.   HICP   inflation   is expected  to  fall  to  close  to  2%,  although  prices  of services are projected to continue to sustain inflation. In December 2000, a centralised two-years wage agreement awarded a general wage rise of 3.1% in 2001 and of 2.3% in 2002. Due to a positive wage drift per- capita wages  increased  by  4.5%  in  2001,  contributing to a rise in unit labour costs by 5%, much above that of the partner countries in the euro area. In 2002, owing to the  agreed  moderate  wage  rises,  nominal  unit  labour costs  appear  to  increase  again  in  parallel  with  partner countries.  Still,  applying  the  previous  average  wage drift  to  the  agreed  rise  in  wages  results  in  labour  cost exceeding  the  average  productivity.  As  for  2003,  the centralised wage agreement could prove costly as wage claims  in  some  part  of  the  public  sector  appear  rather high. As a consequence, and owing also to the pick up in   economic   activity,   the   forecast   expects   average compensations of employees to rise by 3 ¾% in 2003. Public finances The sound position in public finances continued in 2001 with  the  surplus  reaching  a  still  strong  4.9%  of  GDP after a record height of 7% in 2000. The easing of the budgetary balance  owed  to  a  decline  in  the  surplus  of central government finances. Furthermore, local government   finances   relapsed   into   their   customary deficit  position   following  an  unexpected   surplus  in 2000. The budgetary position of the central government was  affected  by  a  marked  fall  in  revenue.  Corporate taxes  dropped  by  about  one  sixth  while  income  taxes were  dampened  by  rate  cuts  in  the  framework  of  the government’s medium-term income tax reform. Moreover,  income  from  privatisation  nearly  faded.  In addition, expenditure increased above the rate agreed in the medium-term spending guidelines. The general government debt to GDP ratio declined by about  ½  pp.  to  43.6%  of  GDP.  The  muted  fall  in  the debt ratio was due to the reduced redemption of central government  debt  but  also  to  the  statistical  effect  of social  security  institutions`  asset  restructuring  away from  domestic  government  bonds  towards  bonds  of other euro-area countries. Even though economic activity is expected to revive in 2002,  the  surplus  in  general  government  finances  is anticipated to continue to ease gently in 2002 and 2003. However,  at  3¼  and  2¾%  of  GDP,  respectively,  the surplus is expected to remain high. The expected easing owes  to  the  further  weakening  of  central  and  local government finances. This  is  due  to  continued  income  tax  cuts,  increases  in central government outlays, manifest in various areas of the budget, and higher expenditure of local governments due to a series of new functions conferred on  them  by  legislation.  Discretionary  measures  like improved  unemployment  benefits  and  increased  social transfers  in  other  areas  will  also  raise  spending.  In 2003, plans  of reforming  the  unemployment  insurance system  and  of  certain  infrastructure  investments  will further increase central government expenditure. In 2002 and 2003, the trend of a mildly rising nominal government debt is expected to continue. This owes to a decline  in  the  primary  surplus  and  to  the  ongoing decline in the holdings of domestic government  bonds by  social  security  funds.   As  a  consequence  of  the expected acceleration of GDP growth, the debt ratio is anticipated to hover around of 43% of GDP during the forecast period		
May/2002	Sweden	The economy is set to recover in 2002 and 2003	The economy in 2001 Swedish economic growth was weak in 2001 and GDP rose by 1.2%, compared with 3.6% in 2000. Despite the fact that export of goods collapsed in Q1-2001 and fell in  real  terms  in  Q2  through  Q4,  the  contribution  to growth  from  net  exports  was  highly  positive,  due  to even bigger falls in import of goods. The global slump in the telecom sector coupled with lower world trade in 2001   weighed   heavily   on   Swedish   exports   and   in particular on manufactured goods. On the domestic side too, economic activity was sluggish. Private consumption   was   up   by   a   mere   0.2%,   adversely affected by strong price rises and also of a notable fall in vehicle purchases of 19%. Share prices continued to be   depressed   during   most   in   2001   and   consumer confidence was low, which led households the increase the  saving  rate.  By  contrast,  public  consumption  rose strongly   in   Q4,   bringing   annual   growth   to   1.4%. Investment  was  relatively  subdued,  but  nevertheless rose   by   1.5%,   influenced   by   very   large    public investment  in  infrastructure  in  Q4.  The  contribution from stocks to growth was negative, with significant de- stocking in the second half of 2001. With the sharp fall of   GDP   growth   and   at   the   same   time   continued employment  growth,  albeit  slowing  substantially  over the year, productivity growth per person fell sharply. Prospects Recent  indicators  point  to  the  economy  being  near  a turning  point.  Both  business  and  consumer  confidence indicators suggest  that  the  downturn  has  bottomed  out and   some   improvements   have   been   recorded   very recently.  Indications  of  a  recovery  in  the  USA  also support    this tentatively positive outlook. These prospects,    both    domestically    and    externally,    are expected   to   result   in   a   gradual   recovery   in   2002. However, annual GDP growth should remain relatively subdued  in  2002,  as  the  overhang  from  last  year  is considerable. A further recovery in growth is expected in 2003, with both private consumption and investment being  more  buoyant.  External  demand  growth  should pick up  further in  2003,  resulting  in  stronger  recovery of exports. Overall, GDP is expected to grow by 1.7% in 2002 and 2.8% in 2003. Inflation is expected to come down from around 3% at present  towards  the  Riksbank’s  inflation  target  of  2% over  the  course  of 2002  and  remain  thereabout  during 2003.   Employment   is   expected   to   fall   slightly   as announced lay-offs materialise in 2002, which results in some   increase   in   unemployment.   This   should   be reversed in line with the economic situation improving further in 2003. GDP components The  tax  cuts  in  2002  raises  disposable  incomes  and should  result  in  higher  private  consumption  growth while  at  the  same  time  allow  for  a  rise  in  the  saving ratio,  being low in comparison  to  recent  years.  As  the economy recovers further in 2003 and some employment  growth  is  expected,  private  consumption should rise further. Investment growth is expected to be relatively  subdued  in  2002,  as  capacity  utilisation  fell last   year.   However,   continued   strong   demand   for housing helps sustain total investment growth. In 2003, an acceleration of, in particular, equipment investment should take place as capacity utilisation rises, resulting in   relatively   strong   investment   growth.   Stocks   are expected  to  contribute  negatively  to  growth  also  in 2002, but should nevertheless turn around over the year and  give  a  small  positive  contribution  in  2003.  As external   demand   growth   is   set   to   gain   momentum during   2002,   Swedish   exports   are   set   to   recover robustly. However, given the falls during 2001, a nnual export growth is expected to be fairly subdued in 2002. In  2003,  a  further  recovery  in  exports  is  expected,  in line with export markets. Imports too should pickup as final   demand   recovers   over   the    forecast   period. However,  the  overhang  of  negative  growth  in  2001  is expected to result in low import growth in 2002. Costs and prices Inflation has remained relatively high since April 2001 and  still  in  March  HICP  inflation  was  3.0%  and  CPI inflation  was  2.9%  This  can  in  part  be  attributed  to temporary  factors,  which  are  expected  to  subdue,  and inflation  should  come  down  towards  2%  during  2002, aided   by   lower   oil   prices.   However,   wages   have recently  accelerated  slightly  despite  wage  agreements reached  in  the  spring  of  2001  for  a  large  part  of  the labour market until 2004, due to higher wage drift. This should moderate as a weakening of the labour market is expected   to   take   place   in   2002.   As   the   recovery advances in 2003 and productivity growth strengthens, wage  increases  of  around  4  %  should  be  compatible with   inflation   close   to   the   Riksbank’s   2%   target. Moreover,   the  strengthening  of  the   Swedish   Krona observed  since  the  end  of  last  year  should  help  limit inflationary pressures. Labour market Employment growth was strong in 2001 and employment   grew   by   2%,   although   it   weakened considerably    over the year.    Lagged effects of announced lay-offs suggest that employment should fall slightly in 2002, which will result in a slight increase in the unemployment rate. In 2003, this is expected to be reversed  and  some  employment  growth  should  help reduce   unemployment,   as   economic   activity   gains momentum. Public finances Swedish public finances have been in surplus each year since 1998 and an increase in the surplus was posted in 2001, of 4.8% of GDP, surpassing the surplus of 3.7% of  GDP  achieved  in  2000.  This  is  to  large  extent influenced  by  carry-over  effects  of  strong  tax  revenue stemming  from,  in  particular,  good  corporate  profits and  capital gains in 2000. The continued  adherence  to the  central  government  expenditure  ceilings  –  central government expenditure came out under the ceilings in 2001 - has also contributed to the strong fiscal position. In 2002, the surplus in public finances is expected to be much lower. Relatively subdued  economic  growth and additional   tax   cuts   of   the   order   of   1.1%   of   GDP contributes  to  this  and  also,  not  least,  the  absence  of positive   carry-over   effects   on   tax   revenue.   On   the expenditure    side,    the    government    maintains    and remains  committed  to  the  previously  set  expenditure ceilings  on  central  government,  as  announced  in  the budget   for   2002.   However,   the   budgetary   margins within  the  expenditure   ceilings   are   very  small  and expenditure  in  some  expenditure  areas,  such  as  sick pay,  could  be  higher  than  planned  in  the  budget.  In addition, relatively high inflation in June 2001 increases indexed transfer payments in 2002. Overall,  it  is  assumed  that  the  expenditure  ceilings  on central government will not be breached, although some discretionary restraining measures may be necessary if signs of spending overruns  become  visible.  This  helps keeping the public finances in good shape and a budget surplus of 1.7% of GDP is forecast for 2002. A stronger budget surplus of 1.9% of GDP is expected in 2003, as economic  growth  accelerates  further.  Gross  debt  was 55.9% of GDP in 2001, almost unchanged  from 2000, despite  the  strong  surplus  recorded  in  2001.  This  was largely due to a reduction in the social security sectors’ holdings of government debt in 2001. The debt-to-GDP ratio  is  nevertheless  expected  to  fall  over  the  forecast period  and  reach  around  50%  of GDP  in  2003,  as  the budget surpluses described above take effect		
May/2002	United Kingdom	Annual growth expected to be a little below trend to 2002 but should be sustained by consumption growth	The economy in 2001 For  2001  as  a  whole,  GDP  growth  averaged  2.4%  - little   below   trend.   GDP   decelerated   during   2001. Output   in   the   final   quarter   of   2001   was   stagnant following three-quarters of respectable growth. Household  expenditure  remained  very  buoyant  in  Q4 and retail sales in recent months suggest strong growth has   continued.   However,   in   Q4   the   strength   of household  consumption  was  completely offset  by  falls in  fixed  investment  and  net  exports;  these  latter  being associated with the global slowdown. General government   consumption   was   surprisingly   weak   in view  of  plans.  On  the  output  side,  services  output continued to rise strongly in Q4, though slower than in recent  quarters,  but  industrial  production  continued  to fall,  in  association  with  falling  exports. The  labour market,  despite  the  slowdown  in  growth,  has  stayed strong. Productivity growth averaged only 1.6% on the year. Inflationary pressures remain weak - on the HICP measure, inflation is under 2% and is around the lowest in the EU. RPIX inflation is around the 2.5% target. Prospects GDP  growth  is  expected  to   recover   early  in  2002 though quarterly growth may remain below trend for a short   while.   Survey   indicators,   for   the   household, services, construction and manufacturing sectors suggest  recovery.  Retail  sales  in  January,  while  down on  those  of  December,  remain  strong  and  the  labour market  is  also  showing  resilience.  Growth  is  expected to rise throughout the year and be at, or slightly above, trend  in  the  second  half  of  2002  as  growth  in  UK markets  recovers.  There  is  little  reason  to  expect  a continuation  of  stagnant  output  revealed  by  the  Q4 2001  GDP  figure.  Indeed,  the  external  factors,  both direct and indirect, that have weakened growth recently may  now  be  recovering  and  the  improving  economic indications in the US are especially  relevant  given  the UK’s  above  average  exposure  to  US  economic  and financial  developments.  This  will  support  continuing growth  in  domestic  demand  resulting,  in  part,  from macro-economic policy; namely monetary loosening in the shape of a 2% cumulative cut in the repo rate since the beginning of the 2001 and a fiscal stimulus, largely in  the  form  of  planned  rises  in  general  government spending. With GDP recovering within the year, growth for  2002  on  average  should  be  around  2%  -  a  little below trend. With growth below trend both in 2001 and 2002, a   small negative output gap will emerge during the course of 2002. Unemployment is expected  to  rise by 0.2 of a percentage point. Upward pressures on wage increases  are   not  expected   and   though   productivity growth may remain weak, rises in unit labour costs will be subdued. With growth in UK markets strengthening, and with a small negative output gap emerging in 2002, growth should rebound in 2003 to a little above trend at 3%. GDP components Growth  in  household  consumption  is  expected  to  be maintained   in   2002,   albeit   below   the   rapid   rates observed  in 2001. Real  wage  earnings  are  expected  to grow  moderately  and  disposable  incomes  will  benefit from  the  cuts  in  interest  rates.  However,  some  rise  in the  saving  ratio  is  expected  as  households  adjust  their consumption  growth  to  more  sustainable  rates  as  the labour market eases a little and rising gross debt levels relative to income act as a restraint. The strong net asset position  of  the  personal  sector,  however,  has  been  re- enforced  by  continued  strong  growth  in  house  prices and will limit the downside risk to consumption growth. While  year  on  year  growth  of  fixed  investment  will remain  weak  with  strong  planned  boosts  to  general government investment being offset to a large extent by a   fall   in   business   investment,   fixed   investment   is expected   to   recover,   within   2002   as   the   global economy,    and    accordingly    business    expectations, revive.  Government  consumption  is  expected  to  be  an important contributor to demand  growth as established in the Government's  Comprehensive  Spending Review that details spending plans to 2003-04. Export growth is expected  to  be  weak  in  2002  as  a  whole  but  recover during the year. Import growth will be a little stronger than export growth in 2002 as a whole Labour Market The  labour  market  has  remained  strong  despite  the global slowdown with the unemployment rate hitting a twenty  five  year  low  of  5.1%  and  is  still  around  this level.   Employment has grown moderately and rose by 0.3%  in  the  final  quarter  of  2001  despite  zero  GDP growth. Wage earnings are not a cause for concern. The labour  market is expected  to  ease a little in 2002  with little    employment    creation   and    a    slight    rise    in unemployment.   Productivity   growth   is   expected   to recover in 2002 from the low rate observed in 2001 but will  remain  a  little  subdued.  With  a  rebound  in  GDP growth expected in 2003, and an expected tighter labour market, it is forecast that productivity will accelerate in 2003.   Unit   labour   costs   rises   are   expected   to   be moderate and sustainable over the forecast period. External balance The current account is projected to be in deficit rising to close to 2% of GDP in 2002 before falling back to 1½% of  GDP  in  2003.  The  negative  contribution  of  net exports of goods and services to GDP growth in 2002 is expected  to  remain quite  high –  around  the same drag as  in  2001  but  is  expected  to  fall  in  2003  as  UK overseas markets show good growth. Prices HICP inflation is low at under 2% - around the lowest in the EU. RPIX inflation is around the 2.5% target. It is  expected  that  the  latter  will  continue  to  be  met. Benign   developments   in   unit   labour   costs,   should continue  in  the  face  of  an  economy  operating  around potential and with unemployment close to the NAIRU.

Chapter 3 Member States, United Kingdom 85 Public finances The general government finances are expected to move into   small   deficit   over   the   period.   Despite   slower growth than expected in 2001, the out-turn for the year was of a substantial surplus of 0.9% of GDP. This will fall  to  a  deficit  of  around  0.2%  of  GDP  in  2002  as growth, in the year as a whole, is slower and some tax revenues,   notably   corporation   tax,   are   weak   and discretionary   expenditure   growth   rises   strongly   as planned.  These  strong  rises  in  expenditure  will  persist into 2003 and the deficit may rise a little to around ½% of  GDP.  The  ratio  of  gross  debt  to  GDP  will  fall  to around 36% by the end of 2003.		
November/2002	Belgium	Economic activity to gain momentum in 2003 and peak in 2004	The situation in 2002 and prospects The recovery in economic activity in the first quarter of 2002   -   real   GDP   growing   by   0.6%   as   against   the previous  quarter,  which  followed  a  negative  real  GDP growth  rate  in  the  last  quarter  of  2001  -  did  not  gain momentum in the second quarter, according to available data.   Furthermore,   recent   statistical   evidence   and survey  indicators  suggest  that  economic  activity  was probably modest also in the third quarter. The synthetic indicator  of  the  National  Bank  of  Belgium  -  which  has proved to be a good early indicator of turning points in the business cycle with a lead of one quarter - stabilised in  October,  after  a  deterioration  in  the  three  preceding months,   while   the   consumer   confidence   indicator followed   a   similar   movement.   These   developments suggest  that  economic  activity  should  remain  weak  in 2002,   real   GDP   growth   being   estimated   at   0.7% compared with 0.8% in 2001. The  scenario  of  an  acceleration  in  economic  activity assumed  in  the  Spring  forecasts  is  still  in  place,  only delayed  by  two  to  three  quarters:  economic  recovery would  be  progressive,  gaining  momentum  in  the  first quarters  of  2003.  The  Belgian  economy  is  expected  to expand  by  2%  in  2003  and  by  a  more  robust  2.8%  in 2004,  on  the  basis  of  stronger  growth  in  international trade, higher investment spending and sustained private consumption. The observed delay in economic recovery may  be  partly  attributed  to  the  lagged  effects  of  weak economic  activity  on  employment:  job  creation,  which remained relatively strong in 2001 despite the economic slowdown, could be zero in 2002; this development will partly  offset  the  effects  on  real  GDP  growth  of  the expected recovery in external demand. GDP components After  two  years  of  very  weak  to  negative  growth  rates, both   export   and   import   volumes   are   expected   to increase  by  healthy  rates  in  2003,  and  further  in  2004. Exports should grow by about 5 to 6 percent each year as  global  economic  activity  and  international  trade  are expected  to  improve  and  Belgium  export  markets  to grow  accordingly.  Imports  should  grow  at  similar  rates supported  by  increased  consumption  and  investment demand.  Private  consumption  is  expected  to  rise  by about  2%  in  2003  and  faster  in  2004  supported  by improvement in employment and real personal incomes. The  saving  rate  should  fall  marginally  in  2003  and further  in  2004  after  having  risen  in  2002  due  to increased   uncertainty   about   economic   developments and  deteriorating  labour  markets.  Private  investment  is expected to rise by 2.5% in 2003 and by a higher rate in 2004  after  an  estimated  negative  growth  rate  this  year; improved   economic   prospects,   notably   concerning export    markets    and,    to    some    extent,    corporate profitability  should  sustain  investment  demand  in  the coming  two  years.  Investment  in  housing  should  also rise   from   a   low   growth   rate   in   2001-02;   public investment  should  be  higher  in  2003  and  in  2004,  after having  declined  in  2001  and  risen  very  modestly  this year. Labour market, cost and prices Job creation is expected to come to a standstill in 2002 as   the   adverse   effects   of   the   prolonged   economic slowdown  are  being  felt,  with  a  lag,  by  the  labour market. Employment should rise again in 2003 although at a rather modest rate and faster in 2004 supported by robust  economic  growth.  Unemployment  should  rise somewhat  this  year  and  resume  its  falling  trend  from 2003. Inflation,  measured  by  the  HICP,  is  estimated  at  1.7% this year, clearly below the 2.3% rate recorded in 2001. Lower import prices, notably oil prices, despite a rise in recent months, and ad hoc factors - the abolition of the radio  and  TV  licence  fee  in  Flanders  and  Brussels Regions   -   is   expected   to   contribute   to   this   trend. Inflation is expected to fall further in 2003 in a context of   still   modest   economic   activity   and   contained production costs and rise somewhat in 2004, remaining however below 2% as economic recovery is expected to be more robust and labour market tighter. Nominal   wage   increases   are   expected   to   remain moderate, contributing to the deceleration in unit labour costs in the coming two years. A new framework wage agreement  for  the  period  2003-2004,  expected  to  be concluded  by  the  end  of  this  year,  will  determine  to  a large  extent  developments  regarding  wages  and  price competitiveness.   Concerns   expressed   about   loss   of competitiveness  by  the  Belgian  economy  vis-à-vis  its main  trading  partners  in  recent  years  should  encourage moderate    wage    agreements;    still    weak    economic activity   and   labour   markets   should   support   such   a tendency.  Nominal  wage  increases  may  be  somewhat higher  in  2004,  but  are  expected  to  remain  relatively contained  in  view  also  of  expected  moderate  wage developments   in   Belgium’s   main   trading   partners, notably Germany. Public finances Despite  the  deterioration  in   economic  developments compared  with  the  projections  of  the  2002  budget,  the general  government  accounts  should  be  practically  in balance  in  2002,  as  a  0.1%  of  GDP  deficit  is  projected for    this    year.    Strengthened    control    of    primary expenditures,    including    social    security    spending, decided   during   the   budgetary   control   exercise   last Spring    and    confirmed    in    June    are    contributing positively  to  fiscal  developments.

C h a p t e r 3 Member States, Belgium 43 of   the   2001   update   of   the   stability   programme   of Belgium  will  be  followed,  taking  also  account  of  the impact  of  the  cycle;  this  implies,  in  particular,  sizeable primary  surpluses  of  the  order  of  6%  in  2002,  and somewhat  lower  in  2003  and  2004,  realised  mainly through control of primary expenditures. The decline in interest payments as percent of GDP resulting from the decline in the debt ratio, will contribute to the projected budgetary   outcome.   According   to   the   forecast,   the government revenue to GDP  ratio is expected to decline in  2002  and  in  2003  and  rise  somewhat  in  2004,  while the   expenditure   ratio   is   projected   to   decline   by 0.6  percentage  point  in  the  three  years  to  2004.  The cyclically   adjusted   primary   surplus   is   expected   to remain  slightly  above  6%  of  GDP  in  2003,  after  an estimated 6.4% in 2002 and 6.2% in 2001, suggesting a broadly  neutral fiscal  stance,  and  decline  to  5.6 % of GDP in 2004. The  2003  draft  budget  confirmed  the  continuation  of the  tax  reform  -  the  main  component  of  which  is  a reduction  in  the  personal  income  tax  -  decided  in  2001 and   planned   to   be   implemented   over   the   period 2002-2006.  The  budget,  based  on  an  assumption  of  a 2.1%  real  GDP  growth,  is  targeting  a  balance  in  the general government accounts for 2003. A corporate tax reform announced last March will be implemented from 2003 and is assumed to be broadly budgetary-neutral. The  government  debt  ratio  should  continue  its  falling trend  over  the  period  of  the  forecast  and  decline  by 3  percentage  points  of  GDP  in  2002  and  by  a  further 8.8  points  over  the  next  two  years  to  96.8%  of  GDP  in 2004		
November/2002	Denmark	Growth sustained by domestic demand	The economy in 2002 After the deceleration of GDP in 2001 to growth at just 1.0%,  the  economy  picked  up  again  in  the  first  half  of 2002.  The  second  quarter  proved  particularly  strong when the quarter on quarter GDP growth rate was 1.1%. So  far  in  2002  growth  has  been  driven  solely  by domestic  demand.  The  expected  acceleration  in  private consumption  finally  seems  to  have  set  in,  primarily driven    by    large    increases    in    car    purchases    by households,   but   retail   sales   have   also   increased   at stronger  rates.  Investment  is  still  growing  robustly,  but the  composition  is  somewhat  surprising  as  especially equipment  investment  has  continued  to  rise  despite  the slowdown  in  economic  growth  in  the  second  half  of 2001,   whereas   residential   investment   continues   to decrease despite the high level of house prices. Exports    have    so    far    held    up    well    despite    the international  slowdown  and  exports  of  goods  grew  by 3.8%   year-on-year   in   the   first   half   of   2002.   The resilience of Danish exports is most likely linked to the composition of goods exported, as their high content of agricultural   and   pharmaceutical   products   tends   to shelter     the     economy     against     external     cyclical developments.  This  results  in  a  tendency  for  Danish export to gain market shares in international slowdowns and   lose   market   shares   in   upturns.   Imports   have increased  slightly  faster  than  exports  resulting  in  a small negative contribution from net exports in the first half of 2002. Inflation  fell  in  the  first  half  of  the  year,  but  has increased again in recent months and is now back at the same level as in the beginning of the year. Prospects Indicators released for the third quarter so far point to a less  buoyant  development  than  in  the  second  quarter. Both industry production and orders are falling and the increase in car sales has been slowing down. Therefore real  GDP  is  expected  to  increase  more  slowly  during the  second  half  of  2002,  resulting  in  an  overall  growth rate for the year of 1.7%. In 2003 real GDP is expected to  grow  by  2.1%  increasing  to  2.4%  in  2004.  In  both years  domestic  demand  is  again  expected  to  be  driving growth,  as  net  exports  are  expected  to  have  a  small negative impact. Currently  the  Danish  economy  seems  well  balanced. The private sector’s net borrowing requirement is close to zero, and the public sector is running large surpluses. However, the labour market is expected to be very tight in   all   three   years   and   especially   in   2004   risks   of overheating  may  emerge.  Public  finances  are  expected to  remain  sound  and  show  healthy  surpluses  over  the forecast horizon. GDP components The  expectation  of  a  weaker  second  half  in  2002  and increasing  growth  rates  again  during  2003  is  reflected in all components of GDP. Private consumption should become  weaker  in  the  second  half  of  2002  as  car  sales and   retail   sales   are   showing   signs   of   moderating. However,  for  the  three  forecast  years  to  2004,  growth rates  of  above  2%  every  year  are  expected  in  line  with increases   in   real   disposable   incomes.   The   weaker outlook  for  production  in  the  third  quarter  and  the general  uncertainty  induced  by  the  recent  stock  market fall  is  foreseen  to  bring  the  current  growth  in  fixed investment to a halt. An acceleration is set to happen in the course of 2003, especially as housing investment is expected  to  increase  from  the  current  low  level.  This increase  is  partly  policy-induced  as  different  measures have been taken to increase housing investments. Exports  of  goods  are  predicted  to  grow  more  slowly than  external  demand  in  coming  years  as  the  persistent high  wage  increases  and  the  strong   krone  implies  loss of  competitiveness.  Furthermore,  export  growth  might also  be  limited  by  capacity  constraints,  especially  in 2004. Imports of goods are expected to be stronger than a  “normal”  relationship  to  final  demand  would  predict as   investment,   which   is   one   of   the   main   growth components  in  all  three  years,  tends  to  have  a  high import   content.   However,   the   current   account   is expected  to  show  surpluses  of    2%  of  GDP  or  above every year. Costs and prices HICP  increases  should  slow  in  2003  as  the  effects  of slow  increases  in  import  prices  and  falling  oil  prices pass  through  and  the  tax  freeze  is  fully  implemented. Furthermore,   the   budget   bill   for   2003   includes   a lowering of excise duties by October 1, 2003. However,  the  larger  part  of  the  effect  of  the  lower excise  duties  will  first  be  visible  in  2004,  where  it  will help curb the tendency for rising inflation, as the effect of  the  small  increases  in  import  prices  disappear.  All through  the  forecast  period  inflation  is  sustained  by relative high increases in prices of services as a result of high wage increases. This leaves it difficult currently to get inflation permanently below 2%. Labour market The labour market has continued to remain tight despite the    slowdown    in    economic    growth    last    year. Unemployment  has  been  largely  unchanged  and  wage increases  are  still  lingering  around  4%.  The  lack  of easing on the labour market in the downturn resulted in a  fall  in  productivity  rates  last  year,  as  some  labour hoarding  took  place.  This  year  productivity  rates  are expected   to   return   to   more   normal   levels,   thereby implying only a limited increase in employment despite the  larger  growth  rate.  Unemployment  is  expected  to decline  slightly  over  the  next  two  years  and  thereby continue  to  remain  close  to  the  estimated  structural level. Employment creation is expected to pick up again next year and grow by a fairly unchanged rate in 2004. Annual wage increases are set to remain high and even rise  in  2004  as  no  extra  reductions  in  hours  worked have  been  agreed  for  that  year  as  most  of  the  current private  sector  wage  agreements  expire  in  the  spring  of 2004. Public finances The  general  government  balance  showed  a  surplus  of 2.8%  of  GDP  in  2001  (excluding  UMTS  of  0.2%  of GDP).  This  year  it  is  expected  to  decrease  to  2.0%  of GDP  primarily  as  a  result  of  a  pension  scheme,  “the special  pension  contribution”,  being  changed  from  a public  pension  scheme  to  a  private  scheme  as  the redistributive   effects   in    the   pension   scheme    are eliminated  and  declining  corporate  tax  revenues  from the extraordinary high level in 2001 A  surplus  of  2.0%  is  also  expected  in  2003  where increased revenues as a result of higher GDP growth is offset  by  lower  corporate  taxes.  In  2004,  the  surplus  is expected  to  increase  to  2.5%  as  the  pension  yield  tax probably will start generating revenues again after three years of hardly any revenue due to the size of the stock market fall. The  debt  ratio  is  set  to  fall  from  the  current  level  of 44%  of  GDP  to  just  below  40%  of  GDP  by  the  end  of 2004.		
November/2002	Germany	Crawling along	The economy in 2002 After  contracting  in  the  second  half  of  2001,  activity picked  up  again  in  the  first  half  of  2002,  rising  in  both Q1  and  Q2  at  a  quarterly  rate  of  0.3%.  Nevertheless, economic  performance  remained  disappointing,  as  it failed  to  set  the  stage  for  the  expected  upturn  in  the second half of 2002. Business expectations, which rose strongly in spring, have started to fall again. Growth  was  exclusively  due  to  decelerating  inventory depletion  and  a  rising  foreign  contribution.  The  latter was,  however,  not  so  much  the  result  of  rising  exports than  of  falling  imports,  which  reflected  a  decline  in final domestic demand by about ½% in each quarter. In particular,   equipment   investment   continued   to   fall strongly  for  the  seventh  quarter  in  a  row,  adding  to  the long-lasting  drag  from  construction  activity.  Private consumption  also  fell,  while  public  consumption  rose only slightly. The  crawling  pace  of  the  economy  can  be  expected  to continue  during  the  second  half  of  2002  and  into  early 2003. No GDP component will provide major stimulus. However,  there  are  tentative  signs  that  the  negative domestic     trends     are     bottoming     out.     Private consumption,  which  fell  noticeably  in  the  first  quarter of  the  year,  has  started  to  pick  up  moderately.  Despite capacity  utilisation  still  being  relatively  low,  slightly rising order volumes suggest a modest recovery also in equipment  investment,  which  is  15%  below  its  last peak.  Reconstruction  activities  in  the  aftermath  of  the Summer  floods  should  give  a  temporary  boost  to  the economy  around  the  end  of  the  year,  as  buildings, productive   equipment,   and   household   durables   are replaced. A further small growth impulse is likely to come from a slowdown in de-stocking. By contrast, no net impulse is expected  from  foreign  trade,  as  the  sharp  decline  in imports is likely to start reverting. With  an  estimated  overall  growth  rate  of  barely  0.4% for 2002, unemployment has been on the rise, reaching a  seasonally  adjusted  4.1  million  in  the  third  quarter, which  is  unlikely  to  fall  rapidly.  High  unemployment continues  to  weigh  on  consumer  spending  and  public finances. On  the  positive  side,  the  2002  wage  round  was  clearly not  as  disruptive  as  might  have  been  feared,  leading  to only   moderate   effective   wage   increases.   Due   to   a substantial  negative  wage  drift,  nominal  tariff  wage rises  by  over  3%  were  actually  accompanied  by  an economy-wide slowdown in effective wage increases in the first half of the year to 1.5%. Therefore, and due to falling  import  prices  and  subdued  growth,  inflation  in Germany is very low. Consumer prices in October were only 1.2% above the level of a year ago, suggesting an inflation  rate  of  1.4%  for  the  whole  of  2002.  Clearly, earlier  fears  of  euro-induced  price  hikes  have  proved largely  unwarranted  but  probably  contributed  to  lower growth as a result of consumers’ spending restraint. Prospects While sputtering on into early 2003, activity is expected to  speed  up  moderately  around  the  middle  of  the  year, leading  to  an  estimated  annual  GDP  growth  around 1.4%.  In  the  first  quarter  of  the  year,  reconstruction  in the flood areas is likely to play a role, especially for the construction  sector.  A  subsequent  decline  in  building activity  should  be  partially  compensated  by  a  slight acceleration   in   equipment   investment.   Furthermore, consumer  spending  is  likely  to  pick  up,  as  the  savings rate  reverts  to  a  lower  level  following  an  increase  in both   2001   and   2002.   High   unemployment   and   the substantial  further  fall  in  stock  market  values  will, however, dampen consumption growth somewhat. The slight acceleration in growth by the middle of 2003 is  likely  to  be  accompanied  by  a  modest  increase  in effective  wages.  Despite  only  small  gains  in  labour productivity,  international  competitiveness  will  thus  be broadly     maintained.     Nevertheless,     the     external contribution   will   not   provide   a   substantial   growth impulse,  because  the  rise  in  domestic  demand  is  likely  to be accompanied by higher imports, thereby offsetting the  import  decline  in  2002.  Overall,  expected  GDP growth in 2003 is therefore mostly driven by rising final domestic demand. A small positive impact is also likely to  come  from  stocks,  as  inventory  depletion  comes  to an end. Growth  in  2004  is  expected  to  reach  2.3%,  thereby reducing  the  output  gap  by  two  thirds.  With  the  trends identified  for  2003  continuing,  domestic  demand  will be  the  main  driver  of  growth.  However,  the  higher figures  for  2004  are  largely  due  to  a  calendar  effect rather than to an acceleration in the underlying forces of growth. Due to an extra calendar day (29 February) and because  of  an  additional  holiday  falling  on  a  weekend, raw  GDP  figures  for  2004  will  be  around  0.6%  higher than calendar-adjusted figures. Employment, costs and prices As  a  result  of  slow  overall  growth  unemployment  is unlikely  to  decline  substantially  and  is  expected  to remain above 4 million in 2003 and to fall only slightly in  2004.  Consumer  price  inflation  in  2003  is  likely  to remain  steady  compared  with  2002,  as  low  labour  cost pressures  and  falling  import  prices  balance  out  with increases  in  indirect  taxes  and  a  temporary  rise  in  oil prices.  As  these  latter  two  effects  subside,  inflation  is likely to moderate gradually in 2004. Public finances Following a revised 2001 outcome of 2.8% of GDP, the general government deficit is projected to reach 3.8% of GDP  in  the  current  year.  This  rise  is  mostly  due  to  a clear   shortfall   in   tax   revenues   compared   with   the official May tax estimate, and a widening gap in social security finances. Not surprisingly, the debt ratio is also forecast to breach the Treaty’s reference value by rising above 60% of GDP. The  deficit  forecast  for  2003  is  based  on  the  following assumptions:  contribution  rates  to  the  pension  system are likely to rise from 19.1% of gross income in 2002 to 19.5%  in  2003;  no  rise  in  contribution  rates  to  health insurance is assumed. Out of the consolidation package agreed  upon  by  the  coalition  partners  in  October,  an overall volume of around 0.2 percentage points of GDP has  been  incorporated.  With  many  specific  measures only  to  be  decided  after  the  forecast’s  cut-off  date,  the ‘no-policy-change’  assumption  implies  that  they  could not  be  taken  into  account.  On  the  other  hand,  the  2003 forecast   assumes   that   some   savings   will   become effective  in  the  health  sector.    If  all  policy  decisions included  in  the  coalition  agreement  are  translated  in specific policy measures and if growth in 2003 reaches at  least  1.4%,  the  deficit  would  fall  below  3%  of  GDP next year. Furthermore,  additional  public  investment  on  account of  the  flood  damages  was  incorporated,  as  was  the postponement of the next step of tax reform from 2003 to  2004.  On  the  basis  of  these  assumptions,  the  2003 general  government  deficit  would  reach  3.1%  of  GDP, with the debt level rising above 61% of GDP. In 2004, accelerating growth conducive to employment creation should make for a further fall in the deficit, in spite  of  the  implementation  of  the  next  step  of  income tax   reform.      Part   of   the   improvement   is   due   to additional  savings  out  of  the  consolidation  programme presented  in  October  2002.    The  debt  ratio,  however, would stay above the Treaty’s reference value.		
November/2002	Greece	Economic growth is easing but activity continues at a strong pace	The economy in 2002 Despite a deceleration due to weak export markets, real GDP  still  rose  at  a  strong  pace  in  2002,  exceeding  the EU  and  the  euro  area  average;  activity  was  mainly supported  by  domestic  demand.  Lower  interest  rates and  consumer  credit  expansion,  combined  with  lower tax  uncertainty,  sustained  private  consumption.  On  the other  hand,  increased  financial  flows  from  the  EU Structural  Funds  and  the  preparation  for  the  Olympic Games  of  2004  boosted  investment,  which  increased much  faster  than  real  GDP.  On  the  external  side,  the slowdown in world demand reduced the rate of increase in  exports,  while  imports  recovered  under  the  impulse of  domestic  demand;  as  a  result,  the  external  balance made a negative contribution to real GDP growth. The  situation  in  the  labour  market  improved  but  at  a slow pace. Total employment is estimated to have risen by 0.3% in 2002. On the other hand, the unemployment rate fell below 10% in the first half of 2002 but should still remain at a high level. A two-year wage agreement in the private sector, signed on 15 April 2002, provides for an increase in the minimum wage in two steps: 3.6% on   1   January   2002   (including   the   adjustment   for inflation  in  2001  equal  to  1.1%)  and  1.8%  on  1  July 2002.  For  2003,  the  agreement  provides  for  a  3.9% increase  in  the  minimum  wage  on  1  January  2003.  On average,  the  benchmark  wage  will  increase  by  5.4%  in 2002  and  4.8%  in  2003.  An  adjustment  for  inflation exceeding  3.3%  in  2002  and  not  exceeding  1%  will  be incorporated on 1 January 2003. Consumer price inflation accelerated in the first months of 2002, as a result of temporary shocks like high food prices due to bad weather. Its rate of increase has been stabilising  since  the  Summer  months  but  remains  high and  above  the  EU  and  the  euro  zone  average.  In addition,  underlying  inflation  that  remained  below  the headline  rate  in  the  first  quarter  moved  above  this  rate in  the  following  months,  implying  the  persistence  of some    inflationary    pressures.    In    2002,    consumer inflation    should    accelerate    further    for    a    second consecutive year. Prospects in 2003 and 2004 Economic  activity  prospects  continue  to  be  good  and will  improve  in  line  with  external  recovery  in  2003. Real GDP growth is expected to continue to rise above potential, averaging around 4% in 2003. Nonetheless, a deceleration  in  investment  in  the  second  half  of  2004 should  result  in  a  somewhat  slower  GDP  growth  in 2004, at around 3.7% on average. Consumer spending is expected to remain sustained and might also accelerate as a result of the 2002 tax reform which  should  increase  disposable  income.  Activity  in the  construction  sector  will  be  buoyant  as  a  number  of infrastructure   plans   need   to   be   finished   before   the Olympic  Games  of  2004,  but  this  factor  will  cease  to exert  a  positive  effect  on  GDP  growth  as  from  mid- 2004.     Nonetheless,     public     investment     growth, supported  by  large  inflows  from  EU  Structural  Funds until  2006,  and  lower  interest  rates  will  assist  private investment  in  the  period  after  the  end  of  the  Olympic Games.  In  addition,  strong  tourist  flows  are  expected for the year of the Olympic Games, implying that at the end  of  the  forecasting  period,  the  negative  contribution of the external balance to real output growth should be much lower than in previous years. Price  developments  are  influenced  by  a  number  of factors  that  point  to  opposite  directions.  Taking  into account  the  underlying  assumptions  for  world  primary commodities    price    increases,    oil    prices    and    the exchange rate of the euro, inflation should decelerate in coming    quarters.    On    the    domestic    side,    some acceleration   in   wages   should   be   implied   from   the application  of  the  compensation  clause  for  the  higher than  expected  inflation  rate  in  2001;  nonetheless,  the content of the April agreement on wage increases in the private sector should imply that cost-pressures might be resumed  as  from  2004  as  there  is  no  compensation  for inflation exceeding a specific rate in 2003. Nonetheless despite  some  weakening,  the  economy  is  expected  to continue  growing  above  potential.  On  the  basis  of  the above,  there  may  be  a  deceleration  in  the  rate  of inflation  until  2004  but  consumer  price  increases  are forecast to average above 3% in 2003 and 2004. Public finances A  significant  methodological  revision  in  the  statistical treatment  of  a  number  of  operations  took  place  in  the course   of   2002,   following   the   recommendations   of Eurostat.  As  a  result,  in  2001,  the  general  government accounts  remained  in  deficit  (at  1.2%  of  GDP  from 1.8%  of  GDP  in  2000)  as  compared  with  a  surplus  of 0.1% of GDP reported previously. However, excluding non-budgeted  receipts  from  the  sale  of  mobile  phone licences  (UMTS)  which  amounted  to  0.5%  of  GDP,  in 2001,  the  government  accounts  should  post  a  1.7%  of GDP deficit. The debt ratio increased also following the recent  revisions  and  reached  107%  of  GDP  in  2001 from 99.7% of GDP estimated previously. The   State   budget   for   2002   and   the   2001   updated stability  programme,  based  on  the  statistical  methods used before the recent revision, targeted a deficit for the State Budget consistent with a surplus of 0.8% of GDP for    the    general    government.    Underlying    further improvement  in  the  budgetary  position,  there  was  the continuing   reduction   in   debt   servicing   costs   which follows the decline in interest rates and in the debt ratio. After reaching 5.1% of GDP in 2001 (or 4.6% of GDP when  excluding  receipts  from  UMTS  licenses),  the primary  surplus  of  the  general  government  remained  at a  high  level  in  2002  (at  4.4%  of  GDP).  The  general government  debt  ratio  which  increased  in  2000  and 2001,  is  estimated  to  decline  in  2002  but  to  remain above 100% of GDP at the end of 2002 For  2003,  the  2001  update  of  the  stability  programme projected  a  surplus  of  1%  of  GDP.  In  the  draft  State budget  for  2003,  presented  in  early  October  2002,  the projected  surplus  is  revised  downwards,  to  0.5%  of GDP.   This   is   mostly   attributed   to   the   estimated budgetary  outcome  for  2002  but  also  to  the  impact  of the tax reform introduced in 2002. Following the recent methodological   changes,   the   improvement   in   the budgetary position of the general government would be reflected in a lower deficit rather than a higher surplus. The budgetary strategy is based on further decline in the interest  burden  for  the  general  government,  while  the projected  fall  in  current  primary  expenditure  should partly  compensate  the  impact  of  the  tax  package.  The primary  surplus  of  the  general  government  is  projected to  decline  gradually  but  to  remain  at  a  high  level. However, the projected cut in primary spending may be difficult  to  implement  given  that  the  main  components of  current  spending  are  highly  inelastic  (mostly,  wages and   grants).   Thus,   it   is   likely   that   the   general government  accounts  will  remain  in  deficit  of  around 1.0%  of  GDP,  in  2003  and  2004,  under  unchanged policies.   Furthermore,   the   primary   balance   should continue  to  decline  until  the  end  of  the  forecasting period.  The  debt  ratio  is  expected  to  be  put  on  a downward  trend,  benefiting  from  the  growth  dividend, and to fall below 100% of GDP at the end of 2004.		
November/2002	Spain	Economy to recover force in 2004	Activity In  2001  GDP  decelerated  significantly,  recording  2.7% growth  for  the  whole  year,  in  sharp  contrast  to  4.2% growth  in  2000,  mainly  due  to  weaker  final  domestic demand.  In  2002  a  deceleration  has  continued,  more marked  than  foreseen  in  the  spring,  with  estimated growth    of    1.9%.    Weaker    than    expected    private consumption   and   investment   have   been   the   main elements   of   such   moderation.   While   exports   and imports  are  expected  still  to  gain  some  momentum,  the external  sector  contribution  to  GDP  growth  should  be neutral  for  the  whole  year.  With  a  better  economic climate   and   improved   consumers’   confidence,   an upward  profile  is  expected  in  2003,  with  GDP  growth of  2.6%,  rising  in  2004  to  around  that  of  estimated potential;  the  output  gap,  relative  to  trend,  should  be close to zero throughout the forecast period. GDP components The slower growth experienced in 2001 was mainly due to  significant  reductions  in  private  consumption  and investment  growth  rates.  Low  growth  of  gross  fixed capital formation can mostly be attributed to investment in  equipment  due  to  worsened  business  expectations. On  the  external  side,  the  moderate  growth  of  exports and  imports  contrasts  with  rises  over  10%  in  2000, mirroring   the   downward   trend   observed   in   world demand. For   2002   as   a   whole   deceleration   is   expected   to continue  as  a  result  of  further  moderation  of  the  main domestic  demand  components.  Private  consumption  is expected  to  slow  as  a  consequence  of  moderation  in employment   and   the   non-indexation   of   income   tax brackets,  which  will  give  rise  a  deceleration  in  gross disposable    income.    The    forecast    shows    a    more optimistic  picture  for  2003.  Private  consumption  is expected  to  gain  some  strength  during  the  first  half  of the   year   due   to   better   economic   prospects   and increasing   employment   growth,   together   with   the positive  effects  on  disposable  income  stemming  from reform  of  the  personal  income  tax.  The  latter  is  also expected  to  lead  to  a  significant  rise  in  the  household saving rate. This trend is envisaged to continue in 2004, with private consumption growing by around 3%. Investment is expected to moderate further in 2002, due to   a   sharp   fall   in   equipment   investment   and   a moderation  in  construction.  With  business  prospects envisaged  to  improve  in  2003,  equipment  investment should gain force. On the other hand, given the strength shown  by  construction  in  recent  years  and  the  brisk increase  in  housing  prices,  a  further  moderation  of  this component  is  expected,  although  it  will  not  totally offset  the  improvement  in  equipment  behaviour.  All  in all,  gross  fixed  capital  formation  should  accelerate  in 2003.  This  trend  should  consolidate  in  2004,  with  both equipment and construction gaining momentum. Exports  and  imports  are  expected  to  rise  in  the  second half  of  2002,  although  still  recording  negative  growth rates in the year as a whole. Along with the recovery of world demand, exports will accelerate in 2003. Imports are  also  expected  to  increase  substantially,  in  line  with the envisaged recovery of final demand. On balance the contribution  of  the  extern al  side  to  GDP  growth  is expected   to   be   neutral   in   2002   and   2003,   turning slightly negative in 2004. Labour market The deceleration of activity has moderated employment creation.  Employment  growth  is  expected  to  slow  to below 2% in 2002 but to rise towards 2½% by the end of     the     forecast     period.     Despite     less     buoyant employment  growth,  the  increase  in  unemployment  in 2002 is expected to be limited and short-lived, with the average rate for the year half a point above that of 2001, with the rate falling further in 2003 and 2004 to around 10% (Eurostat definition) by the end of the period. The activity rate is expected to rise by two percentage points over the period. The  increase  in  employee  compensation  per  full-time equivalent  in  2002  is  expected  to  accelerate  slightly despite  a  weaker  labour  market  than  in  2001,  mainly due  to  the  effect  of  indexation  clauses  stemming  from higher  than  expected  inflation.  However,  unit  labour costs  are  expected  to  remain  unchanged  due  to  a  slight increase  in  labour  productivity,  yielding  a  decline  in  re al   terms   that   would   extend   the   trend   observed   in previous  years.  Despite  the  recovery  of  employment growth  in  2003,  a  slight  moderation  of  compensation per   employee   in   line   with   a   deceleration   in   price developments    and    improved    productivity    should produce a further deceleration in unit labour costs; real unit  labour  costs  should  continue  to  decline.  These trends    are    expected    to    remain    in    2004,    with compensation   per   employee   and   unit   labour   costs moderating further. Prices The  HICP  and  national  CPI  inflation  rates  averaged 2.8% and 3.6% in 2001, respectively, while core HICP inflation   averaged   2.6%   (3.5%   for   national   CPI). Despite  the  relatively  moderate  behaviour  of  wages  in 2002,   price   developments   have   been   worse   than expected, mainly due to unprocessed food and services. While  lower  energy  prices  in  the  first  half  of  the  year contributed  to  a  fall  in  headline  inflation  rates,  core inflation  has  remained  high.  For  2002  as  a  whole  the HICP  and  CPI  inflation  rates  are  expected  to  exceed 3½% before easing to below 3% and 2½% in 2003 and 2004,     respectively,     provided     wage     moderation continues.  Core  inflation  is  expected  to  show  little change  in  2002  compared  with  2001,  though  should moderate in 2003 and 2004. External sector The  current  account  deficit  fell  to  2.9%  of  GDP  in 2001;   growth   of   merchandise   trade   slumped.   A recovery of exports of goods is expected to begin in the second  half  of  2002  as  a  result  of  somewhat  stronger world  demand,  along  with  a  recovery  of  imports.  The upward trend is expected to continue in 2003 and 2004 for    both    exports    and    imports    due    to    a    better international  climate  and  stronger  domestic  activity. The current account deficit is foreseen to narrow further to  below  2%  as  a  result  of  gains  in  the  terms  of  trade and a growing services surplus in both 2003 and 2004. Public finances Despite the economic slowdown in 2002, the relatively good   behaviour   of   tax   revenues,   particularly   the corporate  income  tax,  and  the  moderation  of  public consumption  have  contributed  to  alleviate  pressure  on the   budget.   Consequently,   the   general   government budget  is  foreseen  to  be  in  balance  after  a  deficit  of 0.1% of GDP in 2001. In 2003 the envisaged reform of the  personal  income  tax  is  expected  to  moderate  tax revenues.  The  forecast  of  a  less  optimistic  framework than  that  envisaged  by  the  authorities  in  the  budget leads  to  a  small  deficit  of  0.3%  of  GDP.  Assuming  no policy  changes,  the  budget  is  forecast  to  record  a marginal  surplus  in  2004,  in  line  with  the  scenario foreseen  in  the  stability  programme.  The  debt-to-GDP ratio  is  expected  to  continue  below  60%  and  on  a declining path throughout the forecast period.		
November/2002	France	Sustained domestic demand to remain the backbone of growth	The economy in the first half of 2002 Economic  activity  accelerated  in  the  first  half  of  2002, with  real  GDP  growing  at  an  annualised  pace  of  2%, after  stagnation  observed  in  the  second  half  of  2001. The recovery was driven in the first few months of the year by strong acceleration in exports, which supported the  improvement  in  industrialists’  output  expectations. As  a  consequence,  the  rapid  fall  in  the  stock-to-GDP ratio,  which  had  started  twelve  months  earlier,  came gradually   to   an   end.   At   the   same   time,   public consumption     grew     very     rapidly     and     private consumption,    although    decelerating,    continued    to support real GDP growth. This  recovery  was  not  strong  enough  to  reverse  the deceleration  in  employment  creation,  already  observed since  the  Spring  2001.  Thus,  the  unemployment  rate continued  increasing  and  reached  9.0%  of  the  labour force in August. Private investment remained also very sluggish,    companies    waiting    for    confirmation    of recovery    in    demand    prospects    before    increasing productive capacities in a context of low profitability. Current situation and prospects Several  elements  currently  point  to  weaker  real  GDP growth  in  the  second  half  of  2002.  Indeed,  business survey  indices  have  been  falling  since  April  in  most sectors.  In  manufacturing,  output  expectations,  a  key variable  of  the  survey,  stopped  improving  in  May, before  starting  to  decrease  to  a  level  below  long-term average.  This  deterioration  heralds  a  deceleration,  or even  a  decrease,  in  industrial  production  in  the  second part  of  2002.  In  the  service  sector,  the  latest  business surveys  have  shown  relatively  erratic  fluctuations  with the  main  variables  remaining  close  to  the  long-term average. On the consumer side, fears of unemployment have    continued    increasing    and    confidence    has deteriorated. From  the  beginning  of  2003,  the  recovery  in  the  world economy is expected to trigger an acceleration in export markets.  This  movement,  together  with  still  favourable monetary  conditions  and  a  decline  in  inflation,  should favour  a  gradual  rebound  in  economic  activity.  Real GDP  growth  should  resume  to  a  rate  close  to  potential in  the  first  half  of  2003,  before  further  accelerating  in the second part of next year and in 2004. GDP components The acceleration in export volumes from the beginning of    2003    should    support    an    upturn    in    demand expectations, and create the conditions for a re-stocking phase.  After  eighteen  months  of  stagnation,  productive investment  should  gradually  accelerate  in  the  second half  of  2003,  when  the  upgrading  of  demand  prospects are  confirmed  and  capacity  utilisation  recovers.  The continued  moderation  in  the  cost  of  borrowing  should also contribute to the recovery in private investment. Private  consumption  is  expected  to  remain  relatively dynamic,  although  less  than  observed  in  the  last  three years.  Deceleration  in  real  gross  disposable  income, mainly  due  to  the  slowdown  in  employment  creation and  to  lower  tax  cuts,  explains  the  relative  moderation in private consumption growth in 2003. Labour market, costs and prices The  deterioration  in  economic  conditions  impacted  on the  labour  market  in  2002:  employment  growth  was virtually  nil  in  the  second  quarter,  and  the  situation  is not  expected  to  improve  significantly  before  Summer 2003.   The   slowdown   in   employment   growth   also reflects the gradual fading of the impact of active labour market  policies,  the  end  of  the  reduction  in  working time, and the necessity for companies to restore margins after the strong diminution of the last two years. In this context,  the  increase  in  the  unemployment  rate,  which began  in  May  2001  after  three  years  of  decline,  should continue  until  the  re-acceleration  in  economic  activity induces a rebound in employment creation Wage  moderation  is  expected  to  continue  in  2003  and 2004,  even  if  a  slight  acceleration  by  the  end  of  the forecast period cannot be excluded. Indeed, in 2003 the effects  of  the  harmonisation  of  the  different  levels  of the   minimum   wage   created   by   the   working   time reduction  laws  will  be  counter-balanced  by  a  cyclical deceleration  in  wages.  In  a  context  of  accelerating apparent  labour  productivity,  growth  in  unit  labour costs  is  projected  to  be  moderate  in  2003  and  2004, especially    compared    to    the    relatively    dynamic increment observed in 2001 and 2002. Against    this    background,    underlying    inflationary pressures  should  remain  limited.  Moderation  in  prices will also reflect the consequences of the appreciation of the  euro  and  the  normalisation  of  energy  and  food prices.  After  a  temporary  acceleration  in  the  last  few months   of   2002,   the   year-on-year   rate   of   inflation should  decrease  gradually  during  2003.  In  line  with economic     recovery,     inflation     is     projected     to re-accelerate    moderately    in    the    course    of    2004, although remaining below 2%. Public finances In  2002  public  finances  deteriorated  markedly.  The general  government  deficit  is  now  forecast  to  reach 2.7%  of  GDP  this  year.  This  is  to  be  compared  to  the 1.4%  of  GDP  planned  by  the  French  authorities  in  the Finance   Law   for   2002.   The   Commission   forecast assumes  a  tight  control  in  public  expenditures  in  the second part of the year. The slippage in the 2002 deficit is   due   to   an   overrun   in   expenditures,   worth   0.6- 0.7  percentage  point  of  GDP,  and  to  a  shortfall  in revenues        reflecting        unfavourable        economic developments. The  French  authorities  project  a  stabilisation  in  the general government deficit in 2003 at the same level asin 2002, i.e. 2.6% of GDP according to the draft budget for  2003,  under  the  assumption  of  an  acceleration  in real  GDP  growth  to  2.5%  in  2003.  These  plans  reflect the fact that the margins created by a slower-than-GDP growth   in   expenditures   (+1.5%   in   real   terms)   just compensate   the   implementation   of   tax   cuts   (worth 0.2 percentage point of GDP). A   general   government   deficit   of   2.9%   of   GDP   is projected  for  2003.  This  projection  makes  the  crucial assumption that real expenditures in 2003 will be in line with  the  target  set  in  the  draft  budget  bill  for  2003, except  for  unemployment  benefits  and  for  a  slight slippage  in  health  expenditures.  The  largest  part  of  the difference  with  the  official  forecast  stems  from  the impact of lower growth on budgetary variables. In  2004,  the  general  government  deficit  is  projected  to decrease  to  2.5%  of  GDP.  The  crucial  assumption concerns   real   government   expenditures,   which   are projected   to   increase   by   2%   in   real   terms   by   the Commission.    This    is    to    be    compared    with    an expenditure  increase  by  1.4%  for  2004  in  the  multi- annual  budgetary  projection  associated  with  the  2003 budget.   The   embodied   slippage   in   expenditures   is slightly lower than the average slippage observed since the   introduction   of   multi-annual   plans   exist.   This forecast   takes   into   account   the   slowdown   in   the dynamic  of  public  payrolls  planned  for  2003  and  the full impact of measures on health expenditures. Should developments  on  the  spending  side  and  tax  cuts  be  in line with the multi-annual programme, the 2004 general government  deficit  could  be  0.2  percentage  point  of GDP lower than currently forecast by the Commission.		
November/2002	Ireland	A sharp slowdown followed by recovery to sustainable growth	Output in 2001-2002 Irish real GDP growth fell to 5.7% in 2001, after 9.8% on  average  over  the  period  1996-2000.  While  still impressive  by  EU  standards,  Ireland  experienced  a sharp   downturn   under   the   combined   influence   of (labour)   supply   constraints   and   several   exogenous shocks  (international  slowdown,  ICT  retrenchment  and animal  diseases):  year-on-year  growth  declined  from 12.3% in the first to 0.1% in the final quarter. For 2002, preliminary quarterly national accounts indicate a year- on-year   expansion   of   2.9%   in   the   first   quarter. Industrial production grew 8.8% on the year in the first eight  months,  compared  to  10.2%  for  year  2001,  but this reflects a very strong performance of the chemicals sector (+31.7%); excluding chemicals, industrial output fell by 7.6%. For 2002 as a whole, real GDP growth of just  above  3%  is  expected,  even  more  muted  than  the previous year. Demand components in 2002 As  in  earlier  years,  nominal  disposable  incomes  are being  boosted  by  high  growth  in  earnings  per  capita, significant  direct  tax  relief,  a  rise  in  employment  and very  low  to  negative  real  interest  rates.  Nonetheless, continuing  high  inflation  and  poor  confidence  levels from job losses are depressing private spending growth, especially  when  compared  with  the  record  levels  of 1999-2000.  Excluding  car  sales,  retail  sales  volume  in the first eight months was 2.9% higher than in the same period  of  2001.  Public  consumption  is  also  supporting domestic  demand,  albeit  on  a  reduced  scale  compared with the previous year. Housing completions, which achieved another record in 2001,  benefited  from  budget  changes  and  look  set  to expand   firmly;   in   the   first   six   months   of   2002, completions  rose  5.2%  on  the  year.  Growth  in  other construction  is  forecast  to  be  more  subdued,  partly because  the  roll-out  of  the  National  Development  Plan is   affected   by   high   construction   sector   inflation. Regarding investment in equipment, nominal imports of producer  capital  goods  for  the  first  six  months  (n.s.a.) were  up  28%  on  the  preceding  half-year,  but  fell  11% on  the  year.  In  line  with  this,  the  assumed  gradual recovery  in  overall  equipment  investment  results  in negative annual growth, albeit less dramatically so than in 2001. Merchandise  exports  were  very  strong  in  the  beginning of the year mainly due to an impressive performance of the  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  sectors.  In  the  first seven months, exports expanded 2.2% in volume on the year and, for 2002 as a whole, are expected to post very modest  growth  by  recent  Irish  standards.  Merchandise imports,  which  stagnated  in  2001,  rose  by  2.6%  in volume  in  the  first  seven  months  and  are  forecast  to maintain positive growth, in line with the strengthening of economic activity. Trade in services is forecast to be much more buoyant, as was the case in 2001. Growth in 2003-2004 As  one  of  the  most  open  economies  of  the  EU,  Ireland is    expected    to    benefit    significantly    from    the international  pick-up  in  activity  in  2003,  leading  to  a recovery    of    exports    and    investment.    Reflecting improved  economic  conditions,  a  modest  fall  in  the savings rate after two consecutive years of rises should also  support  private  consumption.  While  activity  will strengthen  as  the  year  progresses,  2003  will  be  another year of below potential growth. For 2004, however, the projections    assume    growth    to    rise    towards    that commonly  thought  to  be  sustainable  in  the  medium term, of above 5%. Labour market The  steady  fall  in  unemployment  since  1996,  when  the rat  e  was  some  12%,  finally  came  to  a  halt  in  early 2001,  having  reached  a  very  low  rate  of  below  4%. Since  then,  unemployment  has  displayed  a  moderate upward  trend.  Over  the  first  nine  months  of  2002,  the rate   averaged   4.4%.   The   economic   slowdown   is expected  to  lead  to  employment  growth  below  labour force growth in both 2002 and 2003, entailing a rise in unemployment. However, in 2004, this situation should be  reversed,  so  that  unemployment  starts  to  fall  again, to  just  under  5%.  This  forecast  assumes  falling  net immigration and slowing population growth. Wage developments Wage  pressures  have  intensified  in  recent  years  in response  to  high(er  than  expected)  inflation  and  labour shortages in a situation of virtually full employment. As a  result,  compensation  per  capita  gained  9.2%  in  2001 after  8.8%  in  2000.  The  available  evidence  for  2002 suggests a delayed response to the economic downturn: in  the  first  six  months,  hourly  industrial  earnings  rose 8.2%  on  the  year,  down  from  10.3%  in  the  preceding half-year.  While  the  forecast  assumes  a  gradual  easing to 2004, growth in compensation per capita is expected to  remain  relatively  high  because  of  a  continued  tight labour    market    and    sticky    inflation    expectations. Regarding    2002,    the    forecast    thus    assumes    a continuation  of  significant  drift  above  the  pay  terms  of the  current  national  agreement,  which  for  the  year amounted to a rise in basic pay of 4.8% and 5.6% in the private  and  public  sector  respectively  and  a  one-off lump-sum   of   1%   of   basic   pay.   With   the   current agreement  expiring  at  the  end  of  the  year,  negotiations for  a  possible  successor  started  at  the  end  of  October 2002. Inflation The  budget  for  2002  introduced  a  package  of  indirect tax  rate  hikes  which,  accordi ng  to  the  Irish  authorities, added  almost  1  percentage  point  to  the  2002  inflation rate (CPI measure). This, together with far higher rates of  underlying  inflation  than  in  2001,  has  produced  a marked   rise   in   inflation   in   spite   of   the   economic slowdown.  Compared  to  4.0%  in  year  2001,  the  HICP rate  averaged  4.8%  over  the  first  nine  months  of  2002 and a similar rate is expected for the year as a whole. In 2003  and  2004,  inflation  should  fall  in  response  to lower   earnings   growth   and   easing   excess   demand pressures,  leading  to  a  narrowing  differential  with  the euro area average. Public finances General  government  data  for  2001  are  not  yet  fully available and have been partly estimated. In 2002, as in 2001,   the   implementation   of   the   budget  has  been marked  by  a  significant  tax  undershoot.  In  the  first  ten months, taxes grew just 2.3% on the year, compared to a  budget  target  of  8.6%.  Furthermore,  discretionary ("voted") spending rose 19.6%, compared to a budgeted rise  of  14.4%  for  the  year  as  a  whole.  The  general government balance is forecast to post a deficit (the first since 1996) of some 1% of GDP, far below the budget- day target of a surplus of 0.4% of GDP (adjusted for the exclusion  of  a  one-off  transfer  from  the  Central  Bank and including UMTS receipts). As the budget for 2003 will  be  unveiled  only  on  4  December,  the  forecasts  for 2003-2004  are  pre-budget.  Given  the  non-indexed  tax and   social   benefits   system,   the   no-policy   change assumption is made operational by freezing average tax rates  and  adjusting  social  transfer  payments  by  the forecast   CPI   inflation   rate   (with   a   top-up   of   1 percentage  point).  The  projections  take  account  of  the cut in the corporation tax rate to 12.5% from 1 January 2003     and,     for     expenditure,     envisage     further implementation   of   the   National   Development   Plan. However,  no  contingency  provisions  are  included  and no  allocation  has  been  made  for  “benchmarking”  (pay increases  for  public  sector  workers  recommended  in July   2002),   because   of   uncertainties   regarding   its degree    and    timing    of    implementation    (the    Irish authorities estimate that full implementation would cost close to 1% of GDP). On these assumptions, the general government  balance  remains  in  deficit,  while  the  value of general government debt broadly stabilises at around 35% of nominal GDP over the forecast horizon.		
November/2002	Italy	Weak domestic demand weighs on the pace of economic recovery	Growth In 2002 real GDP growth is forecast to average around ½   percent,   down   from   1.8%   in   2002.   Economic performance was lacklustre in the first half, staying well behind  what  had  been  expected  in  spring.  It  was  also considerably  weaker  than  in  the  rest  of  the  euro  area. Total  output  edged  up  only  marginally  in  the  first  two quarters, leaving an overhang of merely 0.2% compared with   the   euro   area   average   of   0.5%.   The   lack   of momentum  was  due  to  a  delayed  revival  of  export demand   coupled   with   very   weak   final   domestic demand,  from  which  the  contribution  to  growth  failed to  move  into  positive  territo ry.  Private  consumption expenditure  remained  subdued,  showing  little  to  no response  to  sluggish  but  nevertheless  tangible  signs  of economic   recovery.   In   the   second   quarter   private consumption  was  still  below  the  level  of  a  year  earlier, despite  ongoing  job  creation  and  a  sizeable  increase  in real disposable income. For  the  second  half  of  2002,  estimates  of  industrial production    point    to    a    temporary    acceleration    in economic  activity  in  the  third  quarter,  helped  by  a favourable   working   days   effect.   Thereafter,   leading indicators as well as the likely impact of strikes suggest a  return  to  a  more  measured  but  nevertheless  positive upward    trend.    Only    investment    is    expected    to experience  a  brief  and  more  substantial  upturn  towards the  end  of  the  year,  as  firms  take  advantage  of  the  so- called  “Tremonti”  law,  a  tax  incentive  scheme  due  to expire at the end of December. However, this will only partly  off-set  the  negative  performance  earlier  in  the year. In  2003,  the  sluggish  pace  of  recovery  is  expected  to continue,   with   economic   growth   strengthening   only gradually. A more sizeable acceleration is forecast from around  mid-year,  along  with  an  improved  economic situation  in  the  euro  area  as  a  whole.  The  revival  is assumed  to  be  largely  driven  by  stronger  domestic demand,    benefiting    from    a    favourable    set    of fundamentals. In particular, private consumption should rise  on  account  of  easing  inflationary  pressure  and further   increases   in   disposable   income   backed   by planned   income   tax   cuts.   The   stronger   effective exchange  rate  with  respect  to  the  2002  average  and Italy’s    trade    weighting    towards    foreign    markets expanding  less  than  total  world  trade  are  expected  to dampen   merchandise   export   growth.   The   external contribution   to   growth   is   likely   to   remain   slightly negative.  Nevertheless,  total  output  growth  is  forecast to  approach  3%  in  annualised  terms  in  the  second  half of  the  year,  averaging  1.8%  in  2003  as  a  whole.  For 2004,  taking  into  account  the  carry-over  effect  from 2003  and  assuming  that  economic  activity  expands towards  its  potential  rate  over  the  course  of  the  year, real GDP growth is likely to average around 2.4%. Prices and wages In 2002, in spite of a sizeably negative output gap and a decree law freezing controlled prices up until the end of November,  inflationary  pressure  has  remained  high. Annual  average  CPI  inflation,  which  measures  price increases  gross  of  subsidies,  might  be  around  2.5%, slightly  lower  than  that  of  the  HICP  as  household medical   cost   contributions   were   increased   over   the course  of  the  year.  Inflation  is  forecast  to  ease  early  in 2003  as  the  negative  output  gap  persists  essentially unchanged  and  import  prices  benefit  from  a  stronger euro. Unit labour costs are also assumed to contribute to lower    inflation,    mainly    through    an    increase    in productivity.   Wage   increases   are   forecast   to   stay moderate. Employment and unemployment In   clear   contrast   with   most   euro   area   economies, employment continued to increase in Italy up until July 2002,   although   at   a   slowing   rate.   The   rate   of unemployment fell to 9.0%, a ten-year low. By regions, however, employment started to decline in the northern part  of  the  country,  signalling  that  the  positive  trend  in the  country  as  a  whole  is  likely  to  come  to  a  halt. Moreover,  planned  layoffs  at  FIAT  and  the  ensuing effects   on   suppliers   can   be   expected   to   have   a measurable impact on total employment. Consequently, job creation is forecast to turn negative in late 2002 and to  recover  gradually  over  the  course  of  the  following two    years.    The    declining    trend    in    the    rate    of unemployment  is  expected  to  stop  in  2003  and  to resume in 2004. Public finances After   a   deficit   of   2.2%   of   GDP   in   2001,   general government net borrowing in 2002 is estimated at 2.4% of  GDP,  decreasing  marginally  in  2003  also  as  a  result of  sizeable  one-off  measures  (1.2%  of  GDP,  compared to  0.7%  in  2002).  In  2004  the  “no-policy-change” deficit  is  estimated  at  around  3%  of  GDP.  Reflecting  a large   and   largely   unexplained   discrepancy   between government  accounts  in  accrual  and  cash  terms  (see chart   3.16),   the   government   debt   ratio   in   2002   is expected  to  slightly  increase  compared  to  2001  and  to decline  very  gradually  in  2003-2004.  Developments  in the  debt  ratio  over  the  forecast  period  do  not  take  into account  an  announced  financial  operation  which  could lower the debt ratio at the end of 2002 below the 2001 level   and   slightly   accelerate   the   projected   pace   of reduction in subsequent years. The forecast takes into account the effects of the decree laws of 8 July (which blocks tax credits for recruitment and   investment   in   disadvantaged   areas   and   curbs increases    in    healthcare    expenditure)    and    of    24 September  (urgent  measures  to  increase  tax  receipts). Despite  these  measures,  sales  of  real  assets  amounting to some 0.6% of GDP and receipts from a tax amnesty for  assets  held  abroad  totalling  another  0.1%  of  GDP, the  primary  surplus  drops  markedly  in  2002  compared to  2001,  partly  offset  by  the  large  decline  in  interest payments. Current tax receipts decrease slightly relative to GDP, also due to the lesser effect of some transitory revenue-boosting  taxes  in  2001.  Moreover,  there  are uncertainties  as  to  the  expected  yields  of  other  taxes, notably the tax on the re-evaluation of assets introduced in  the  Budget  Law  for  2002.  The  strong  increase  in primary expenditure in percentage of GDP compared to 2001 is due to higher outlays for healthcare, wages and pensions. The   draft   Budget   Law   for   2003,    unveiled   on   30 September,   introduces   a   reduction   in   the   personal income  tax  estimated  at  0.3%  of  GDP,  as  well  as  a sizeable  tax  settlement  operation,  estimated  to  improve the  budget  balance  by  0.4%  of  GDP,  and  a  new  tax amnesty  for  assets  held  abroad,  expected  to  yield  a further  0.2%  of  GDP.  The  Commission  forecast  fully includes  the  estimated  effects  of  these  measures,  all  of which   have   essentially   transitory   effects.   Planned savings in government purchases of goods and services on    the    part    of    the    central    and    decentralised administrations   and   in   subsidies   to   enterprises   are estimated in the forecast to total 0.6% of GDP. It should be  noted  that the  government’s  amendment to the   Budget   Law,   presented   to   Parliament   on   31 October,  has  not  been  assessed  and  its  effects  are  not included      in      the      Commission      forecast.      The Commission’s   budgetary   estimate   also   hinges   on planned  sales  of  real  assets  of  0.6%  of  GDP,  which carry  a  degree  of  uncertainty,  as  they  concern  not  yet fully identified state property. The  forecast  for  2004  is  based  on  legislation  currently in  force.  Tax  and  social  security  contributions  receipts are  consistent  with  the  macroeconomic  framework  and with the estimated effects of the measures in the Budget Law    for    2003.    Other    revenues    and    non-interest expenditures  are  forecast  on  the  basis  of  the  trends underlying  the  updated  official  projections  for  2003- 2006  released  in  September.  The  rate  of  increase  of compensation  of  employees  has  been  adjusted  for  the assumption  on  inflation.  Gross  fixed  capital  formation reflects much lower sales of real assets. Capital receipts reflect the expiration of one-off revenue measures.		
November/2002	Luxembourg	Significant slowdown as services exports weaken, but recovery expected	The situation in 2002 In 2001 economic growth in Luxembourg slowed down sharply  to  1.0%,  following  many  years  in  which  real GDP growth clearly exceeded the EU average. In view of   the   very   open   character   of   the   Luxembourg economy,  the  slowdown  was  primarily  due  to  weak export   growth   of   1.6%,   in   line   with   the   cyclical downturn  in  world  trade,  while  import  growth  at  5.0% remained  strong,  sustained  by  still  buoyant  domestic demand. The deceleration in exports was primarily due to a 0.4% decrease in services exports, probably largely accounted for by weakness in financial services exports in  response  to  the  turmoil  on  global  financial  markets. The deterioration of the external balance continued into the  first  half  year  of  2002,  mainly  due  to  a  contraction in  the  value  of  exports.  In  general,  exposed  sectors  of the     economy,     notably     financial     services     and telecommunications  as  well  as  manufacturing,  showed signs  of  further  weakening,  along  with  the  general slowdown  of  economic  activity  in  the  EU.  However, the  performance  of  sheltered  sectors  has  been  more positive  during  the  first  part  of  2002.  Retail  trade remained rather buoyant, probably due to the dynamism in   private   consumption,   boosted   by   strong   (albeit decelerating)  job  creation  and  an  acceleration  in  wage increases.  By  contrast,  construction  output  was  quite strong  in  the  first  half  of  2002,  in  particular  public construction  investment.  Strong  growth  in  economic activity in recent years resulted in a very fast increase in employment,  which  rose  by  5.6%  in  2001.  This  strong job  creation  slowed  down  in  the  first  eight  months  of 2002,    and    was    even    negative    in    manufacturing. Consumer  price  inflation  decelerated  between  January and  August  2002,  largely  due  to  base  effects,  despite some upward impact of the cash changeover to the euro concentrated at the beginning of the year. Prospects Real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  slow  down  further  in 2002  to  a  mere  0.1%,  well  below  the  EU  average.  The stagnation  of  economic  growth  not  only  stems  from  a drag  from  the  external  sector  but  also  from  a  marked slowdown in domestic demand, despite strong increases in     real     government     consumption,     as     private consumption growth is expected to moderate and gross fixed  capital  formation,  particularly  in  machinery,  will be   adversely   affected   by   the   economic   slowdown. Private consumption would decelerate to 2.3% in 2002, due   to   lower   increases   in   real   wages,   decelerating employment  and  increased  uncertainty  on  the  part  of consumers which will likely lead to higher savings. For 2002,  it  is  expected  that  a  major  drag  on  activity  still stems   from   adverse   developments   in   the   financial sector,   which   will   impact   negatively   on   services exports. Given the size of the negative external shock to the   financial   sector   that   affected   the   Luxembourg economy   already   last   year,   a   (somewhat   delayed) negative impact on overall employment and on activity in   a   broader   range   of   business   services   sectors   is expected.  Overall  economic  prospects  are  somewhat more  favourable  over  the  remainder  of  the  forecast horizon;  a  pickup  in  real  GDP  growth  to  2.0%  is foreseen  in  2003  as  a  result  of  a  more  favourable external  environment  which  would  help  exports  and private   investment   to   gradually   recover   from   the adverse  impact  of  the  global  cyclical  downturn.  In 2004, real GDP is expected to grow by 5.6% largely as a result of a recovery of domestic demand. Employment and unemployment Employment  growth  should  decelerate  in  the  course  of 2003,  reflecting  the  slowdown  in  economic  activity with  a  lag.  Total  employment  growth  is  forecast  to decrease to slightly over 1% in 2003, before picking up to  1.6%  in  2003  in  line  with  the  upturn  in  economic activity.  As  job  creation  in  recent  years  had  mostly benefited  non-residents,  the  slowdown  in  employment growth  will  result  in  a  particularly  sharp  slowdown  in the number of frontier workers. However, it should also lead  to  a  rise  in  the  number  of  resident  unemployed even if a significant part of this increase is likely to be cushioned by the specific measures for the unemployed already  implemented  by  the  authorities.  Consequently, the  rise  in  registered  unemployment  is  likely  to  be cushioned. Costs and prices HICP  inflation  is  predicted  to  fall  to  1.9%  this  year, from  2.4%  in  2001,  due  to  lower  energy  prices,  a weakening   of   unit   labour   costs   and   to   a   cyclical contraction   in   profit   margins.   Harmonised   inflation should  subsequently  slightly  decelerate  further  to  1.8% in   2003   and   remain   at   this   rate   in   2004,   as   the moderating  impact  of  decelerating  unit  labour  costs would be compensated for mainly by the unwinding of the  negative  contribution  of  energy  prices  and  by  a recovery in profit margins. Decelerating inflation would allow wages increases to slow down gradually over the forecast horizon while remaining probably faster than in neighbouring  countries.  The  expected  moderation  in unit  labour  costs  is  largely  due  to  a  cyclical  pick  up  in labour productivity growth. Public finance Strong  domestic  activity  boosted  government  revenues in  2001.  Hence,  despite  a  round  of  tax  cuts  and  rather strong government expenditure, the general government surplus  amounted  to  6.1%  of  GDP,  compared  to  5.6% in 2000. Substantial surpluses were recorded both in the central  government  and  with  the  social  security  funds. In 2002 the general government surplus should decrease significantly.  This  outcome  is  attributable  both  to  the decrease in the revenue-to-GDP ratio and to the marked increase   in   spending   caused   by   slower   economic growth. The broad tax reform implemented in 2001 and 2002  will  negatively  affect  receipts  of  both  corporate taxes    and    income    taxes    from    2002    onwards. Government  expenditure  will  continue  to  grow  fast mainly owing to an increase in social payments and the sustained growth in government expenditure and public investment    in    infrastructures.    Consequently,    the expenditure  to  GDP  ratio  is   considerably,  to  45.2%  of GDP  in  2004.    The  general  government  surplus   is expected  to  turn  projected  to  increase  into  a  deficit  of 1.8  and  1.9%  of  GDP  in  2003  and  2004  respectively, due  to  continued  strong  growth  in  expenditure,  the lagged impact of the slowdown in economic activity on revenues from taxes and social contributions, as well as the effects of the tax reform. Public debt is expected to reach 5.4% by 2004.		
November/2002	Netherlands	Economic growth stalls as high labour costs lead to competitiveness problems	The situation in 2002 Following a number of years in which real GDP growth exceeded   the   EU   average,   the   Dutch   economy   is experiencing  a  sharp  slowdown.  Real  GDP  growth  is expected  to  reach  a  mere  0.2%  in  2002.  In  the  second quarter of 2002, economic growth hovered around zero in  quarter-on-quarter  terms  for  the  fourth  consecutive quarter.  As  elsewhere  in  the  EU,  the  slowdown  in activity was to a large extent due to the deceleration in international    trade.    The    decline    in    exports    was accentuated     by     the     deterioration     in     external competitiveness  and  the  consequent  losses  in  export market  share.  The  recent  appreciation  of  the  euro  has been   an   additional   factor   dampening   Dutch   export growth. In addition, domestic demand and in particular private  consumption  has  also  weakened  considerably for  a  number  of  reasons.  Private  consumption  growth has   been   lacklustre   on   the   back   of   the   significant declines in consumer confidence, signs of a reversal on the  labour  market  as  the  unemployment  rate  started  to rise,   and   the   negative   impact   of   high   inflation   on household real disposable income. Moreover, the slump on  equity  markets  and  the  moderation  on  the  housing market  led  to  the  fading  out  of  wealth  effects  that  had boosted  private  consumption  between  the  mid-1990s and  the  year  2000.  The  household  saving  ratio  sharply increased  in  2001  and  likely  will  remain  high  in  2002, despite   substantial   gains   in   household   disposable income  due  to  the  2001  tax  reform,  as  households appear  reluctant  to  spend  in  response  to  the  economic downturn,    volatility    on    financial    markets,    and heightened   concern   about   economic   prospects.   A deterioration  in  profits  and  slow  growth  put  downward pressure    on    investment.    Investment    growth    was strongly  negative  in  the  first  two  quarters  of  2002 reflecting    weak    business    confidence,    lower    than expected  corporate  profits,  uncertainty  partly  resulting from the turmoil in financial markets, losses in external competitiveness, and sluggish housing investment. Prospects: slow recovery in the course of 2003 A  recovery  in  exports  and  some  rebound  in  domestic demand  would  lead  to  a  modest  upturn,  starting  from the second half of 2002 onwards. This will result in real GDP growth reaching 0.9% in 2003 and 2.2% in 2004. In 2003, consumer demand will remain sluggish despite a drop in inflation, reflecting uncertainty on the part of consumers and a worsening labour market. In 2004, the expected  further  fall  in  inflation  and  a  recovery  in employment  growth  would  underpin  real  disposable household  income.  Hence,  private  consumption  growth is  expected  to  increase  to  1.5%  in  2004.  Private  non- residential   capital   formation   is    expected   to   recover gradually  in  the  course  of  2003  and  2004,  in  line  with the  upturn  in  domestic  and  external  demand,  with  total investment  growth  reaching  2.2%  by  2004.  On  the external  side,  export  growth  is  expected  to  recover  to 4.1%   in   2003   and   5.7%   in   2004   in   line   with developments  in  world  demand.  However,  over  the forecast horizon, the recovery of net exports is expected to  be  relatively  muted  comp ared  to  previous  cyclical upswings, as losses in competitiveness not only dampen the  recovery  of  exports,  but  also  lead  to  a  gradual increase     in     import     penetration.     Restraints     on government    spending    put    in    place    by    the    new government   would   limit   the   growth   rate   of   real government  consumption  to  0.3%  next  year  and  1.2% in  2004.  The  contribution  of  inventories  to  real  GDP growth  is  expected  to  turn  slightly  positive  in  2003, following  the  drag  on  growth  put  in  2002  during  the downward phase of the inventory cycle. A risk to the forecast concerns the impact of the decline in  equity  prices  on  pension  fund  reserves.  For  around 300  pension  funds  out  of  a  total  of  some  900,  reserves have   fallen   below   the   statutory   minimum   coverage ratio, according to the Pension and Insurance Chamber. Covering  even  part  of  the  shortfall  by  raising  pension premiums over the forecast horizon (for the largest part borne  by  companies)  would  have  significant  adverse macro-economic  effects.  For  2003,  under  the  relatively cautious   assumption   of   a   rise   in   private   pension premiums  paid  by  1.3%  of  the  wage  bill  and  a  rise  of 2.3  percentage  point  in  public  pension  premiums,  real GDP  growth  would  decrease  by  0.1%,  the  general government balance would deteriorate by 0.2% of GDP and   private   sector   wage   costs   would   increase   by 0.9 percentage point. Employment and unemployment Employment  is  forecast  to  decrease  by  0.5%  in  2003 and  then  to  gradually  pick  up  again,  reaching  0.2%  in 2004,  following  the  cyclical  recovery  of  output  with  a lag.   As   a   consequence,   the   unemployment   rate   is expected  to  rise  substantially  and  to  stand  at  4.5%  on average  in  2004,  reflecting  the  lagged  response  of  the labour  market  to  the  economic  slowdown  and  Cabinet plans to cut down the number of civil servants. The lag with   which   employment   growth   responds   to   the slowdown  in  activity  should  be  longer  than  usual,  due to ‘labour hoarding’ in a labour market, which has been very  tight  in  recent  years.  It  is  envisaged  that  labour supply  will  grow  at  lower  rates  than  witnessed  in  the second    half    of    the    1990s,    partly    because    of demographic factors. Costs and prices HICP   inflation   would   gradually   decrease   over   the forecast  horizon,  to  2.8%  in  2003  and  2.4%  in  2004.

E c o n o m i c F o r e c a s t s , A u t u m n 2 0 0 2 The Netherlands 70 The  drop  in  inflation  mainly  reflects  an  easing  of  unit labour  costs  due  to  a  slight  moderation  of  wages  and  a rebound in labour productivity growth (from a historical low of–0.7% in 2001 - largely due to labour hoarding - to around 2% by 2004), despite some recovery of profit margins. The drop in import prices in 2002 and 2003 is another   factor   contributing   to   lower   inflation.   The upward  impact  of  the  euro  cash  changeover,  which  De Nederlandsche Bank estimated at around 0.6 percentage point  in  the  first  six  months  of  2002,  is  expected  to fade. Despite the expected easing of the labour market, continued shortages in certain segments and a relatively high  inflation  rate  are  expected  to  keep  wage  increases relatively   high,   with   compensation   per   employee projected to ease only gradually from slightly above 5% in  2002  to  3.8%  in  2004.  This  would  allow  for  a recovery in profit margins. On the other hand, increases in  pension  premiums  are  expected  to  counterbalance part of the beneficial effect of easing wage increases on labour costs. Public finance In   the   2003   budget,   the   new   Dutch   government introduced   expenditure   cuts   and   tax   increases   to improve   the   budgetary   situation.   However,   deficits would    continue    to    persist      over    the    forecast horizonpartly  because  of  sluggish  economic  growth. The  small  2001  budget  surplus  (0.1%  of  GDP)  is projected  to  deteriorate  to  -0.8%  in  2002  and  -1.2%  in 2003,  before  improving  somewhat  to  -0.9%  of  GDP  in 2004.   This   pattern   partly   reflects   the   operation   of automatic  stabilisers  in  a  weak  economic  environment. In   2003   and   2004,   significant   tax   increases   and expenditure   cuts   are   planned   to   avoid   a   further deterioration  in  budget  balances.  Tax  increases  will mainly take the form of an elimination of personal and corporate  income  tax  deductions.    Expenditure  cuts relate  to  the  number  of  civil  servants  and  the  flow  of income from the central government to the regional and local    authorities.    In    addition,    benefits    for    the unemployed   and   disabled   are   to   be   reduced.   The deteriorating  economic  environment,  however,  implies that  the  goal  of  avoiding  ex-ante  deficits  will  not  be achieved   over   the   forecast   horizon.   That   said,   in cyclically   adjusted   terms   the   general   government balance  is  forecast  to  improve  from  a  slight  deficit  in 2002 to an estimated surplus of 0.6% of GDP by 2004. The  pace  of  debt  reduction  will  be  relatively  slow, resulting  in  a  gross  government  debt  ratio  of  48.8%  of GDP in 2004		
November/2002	Austria	Domestic demand to recover after nose-dive in 2002	Developments in 2002 Having  contracted  in  the  second  and  third  quarter  of 2001, the Austrian economy resumed growth up to mid- 2002.  Nevertheless,  economic  performance  during  the first  half  of  the  year  was  disappointing,  because  of  a sharper   than   anticipated   fall   in   domestic   demand growth,   owing   to   sluggish   household   demand   and falling investment. Private  consumption  is  set  to  grow  at  only  about  half the rate of 2001, with disposable income of households being  squeezed  by  weak  employment  growth,  rising unemployment  and  higher  than  anticipated  inflation. Investment  took  a  dive  in  the  first  half-year,  with construction    suffering    from    excess    supply    and budgetary    restraint,    while    equipment    investment plunged  owing  to  deteriorating  demand  expectations. For  the  second  half  of  2002,  little  improvement  is  in sight from either the domestic side or external trade due to the delay in the international economic upswing. The only   exception   is   construction   demand,   which   is expected   to   benefit   from   the   recent   flood   disaster already in the fourth quarter and also in 2003. Although the  rise  in  exports  is  forecast  to  decelerate  sharply,  the growth   contribution   of   the   external   sector   should increase,  reflecting  a  slump  in  import  growth.  Overall, at  some  ¾%  output  growth  is  expected  to  remain unchanged compared with the previous year. Notwithstanding  a  temporary  acceleration  in  August, inflation  declined  in  the  first  three  quarters  and  is expected  to  continue  its  downward  trend.  Weak  output growth  led  to  a  sharp  increase  in  unemployment,  with the unemployment rate staying nonetheless significantly below the EU15-average. Prospects The   economic   recovery   should   gain   momentum   in 2003, thanks to strengthening domestic demand and the expected  upswing  in  world  economic  growth.  Private consumption   should   pick   up   as   a   result   of   higher disposable   income   growth   and   rising   employment levels,  while  public  consumption  is  expected  to  be curbed.   After   a   dive   in   2002,      investment   should rebound,  reflecting  the  improved  outlook  for  exports. As  a  result,  real  GDP  growth  in  2003  is  expected  to accelerate  to  some  1¾%.  Domestic  demand,  being  the mainstay of growth already in 2003, is projected to gain momentum  in  2004  and,  combined  with  higher  export growth,  bring  overall  GDP  growth  close  to  a  rate  of 2¼%. Demand components Having  contracted  in  2002,  household  real  disposable income  should  expand  again  in  2003,  if  moderately, thanks to decelerating inflation and rising employment. As a result, private consumption is expected to recover quite  vigorously  in  2003  and  more  strongly  in  2004. Public   consumption   is   forecast   to   remain   subdued throughout the projection period, assuming that the new government, to be formed after general elections in late November,   will   make   efforts   to   control   budgetary spending.  Construction  investment,  in  particular  civil engineering  but  also  housing  construction,  is  projected to  benefit  from  the  flood  disaster,  with  a  turnaround  of the  downward  trend  expected  as  of  2003.  Equipment investment   is   expected   to   pick   up   by   mid-2003 reflecting   the   improvement   in   demand   prospects. Exports are expected to gain momentum, coming in full swing in 2003. With imports also surging, reflecting the expected  pick-up  in  domestic  demand,  the  contribution of  net  exports  to  GDP  growth  should  decline  in  2003 and turn negative in 2004. Prices and Wages Consumer price inflation is likely to abate somewhat in 2003  as  falling  import  prices  and  decelerating  unit labour   costs   should   more   than   offset   a   temporary increase in oil prices, and remain unchanged in 2004. Sluggish   growth   in   2002   is   expected   to   lead   to relatively  moderate  private  sector  wage  agreements  for 2003,   with   nominal   increases   in   contractual   wages somewhat  below  those  of  2002.  In  2004,  despite  wage moderation  in  the  private  sector  expected  to  continue, the  cyclical  upswing  should  lead  to  somewhat  higher wage  settlements  than  in  2003.  In  the  public  sector, however, given that the wage increase for 2001-02 was very  moderate  and  entailed  significant  losses  in  real terms,  an  additional  pay-rise  to  partly  compensate  for purchasing  power  losses,  is  expected  for  2003.  In  sum, wage growth in 2003 should be below that of 2002 and increase somewhat in 2004. Labour market In  2002,  sl uggish  output  growth  has  an  adverse  impact on  the  labour  market.  Total  employment  is  expected  to fall,   with   dependent   labour   nevertheless   expanding slightly.     With     overall     output     growth     gaining momentum,  a  more  sustained  pick-up  in  the  labour market  should  be  expected  as  of  mid-2003.  With  the number  of  self-employed  almost  stagnating  over  the forecast   period,   total   employment   growth   is   thus expected to resume in 2003. As of 2003, labour supply is  forecast  to  change  in  line  with  the  business  cycle, contrary   to   the   recent   counter-cyclical   expansion. Reflecting  the  projected  tendencies  of  labour  demand and  supply,  the  sharp  rise  in  unemployment  in  2002  is expected  to  come  to  a  halt  in  2003  before  turning around in 2004. Current account In  2002,  the  current  account  deficit  is  expected  to almost halve due to weak domestic demand. The slump in   import   growth,   will   yield   an   exceptional   –   but transitory - trade surplus in 2002, and a widening of the services  balance  surplus.  Owing  to  a  negative  incomes balance, however, the current account should register a deficit.  As  of  2003,  with  domestic  demand  recovering, merchandise    imports    are    projected    to    accelerate, outpacing the expansion of goods exports, and thus the trade balance should turn negative again. Public finances In 2001, general government finances improved from a deficit  of  1.6%  of  GDP  in  2000  (excluding  UMTS proceeds)   to   budgetary   balance   (figures   in   ESA   95 definition,  i.e.  disregarding  Swap  operations).  As  this was    achieved    against    low    output    growth,    the improvement  in  the  cyclically-adjusted  position  was even stronger. The favourable outcome in 2001 was due mainly  to  a  strong  rise  in  tax  revenues,  exceeding expectations, and resulting in a sharp increase in the tax burden to almost 46% of GDP. In 2002, however, the budgetary position is projected to weaken   substantially   to   a   deficit   of   1.8%,   thereby deviating  significantly  from  the  stability  programme target of a balanced budget. The  expected  deterioration  is  largely  due  to  revenue shortfalls  compared  with  earlier  official  estimates:  a negative “echo-effect” related to the tax regime shift in 2001  and   the  economic  slowdown,  in  particular  the weakness  of  domestic  components,    are  all  bearing down tax revenues. Expenditure  growth  is  difficult  to  be  reined  in,  despite the continued exonerating effects of the pension and the administrative  reform.  Apart  from  an  emergency  aid package  related  to  the  recent  flood  disaster,  totalling some 0.6% of GDP, of which some ¼ percentage point affects the year 2002, social security spending increased more strongly than the authorities had anticipated. Moreover, the surplus at the Länder level is projected to decline from 2001. In 2003, no special factors – largely accounting for the budgetary  results  in  2001  and  2002  –  should  affect  the budgetary   outcome,   apart   from   the   flood   disaster emergency  package.  The  tax  intake  should  return  to normal    patterns.    Additional,    partly    flood    related spending  should  more  than  offset  the  continued  impact of  expenditure  restraint.  Public  sector  employees  may be  granted  an  additional  pay  rise,  making  up  for  past purchasing  power  losses.  In  sum,  the  expected  cyclical upswing,  conducive  to  employment  creation,  should slightly lower the deficit in 2003 and 2004. The  forecast  for  2003  is  subject  to  great  uncertainty. The   Austrian   government   had   collapsed   before   the budget   for   2003   was   passed.   Early   parliamentary elections  are  scheduled  for  24  November  2002  and  the budget for 2003 will be adopted only next year.		
November/2002	Portugal	Further adjustment towards more sustainable levels of domestic demand	The economy in 2002 Following a period of strong growth driven by buoyant domestic    demand,    economic    activity    started    to decelerate  in  the  second  half  of  1999.  This  slowdown continued  uninterrupted  into  2002.  The  pace  of  growth decreased   from   an   average   of   3½%   per   year   in 1999-2000 to 1.7% in 2001, and is estimated at around ¾%  in  2002.  This  basically  reflects  faltering  domestic demand  (both  private  consumption  and  investment), which   was   only   partly   offset   by   a   rise   in   the contribution  to  growth  from  the  net  foreign  balance.  In particular,  growth  of  private  consumption  has  seen  a sharp  deceleration,  with  purchases  of  durable  goods receding in the first half of the year, while investment is expected  to  fall  by  nearly  3½%  in  2002,  reflecting  a marginal decline in residential construction and a more marked  contraction  in  equipment  investment.  Public investment  is  estimated  to  recede  on  account  of  an electoral  cycle  that  ended  in  2001,  and  due  to  the impact  of  the  saving  measures  adopted  in  the  2002 rectifying  budget,  especially  the  planned  sale  of  assets which   are   to   be   recorded   as   negative   investment. Merchandise  exports  should  rise  by  about  3%  in  2002, exceeding    the    pace    of    foreign    demand    growth. Therefore,  the  Portuguese  economy  is  assumed  to  gain market  shares  in  2002,  further  to  the  gains  recorded  in 2001.  At  the  same  time,  weakening  domestic  demand brought  about  a  strong  deceleration  in  merchandise import  growth  from  1%  in  2001  to  about  ¼%  in  2002. All  considered,  the  contribu tion  of  total  net  exports  to output growth rose to about  ¾ pp of GDP. Outlook In the first three quarters of 2002, and according to the coincident   indicator   on   current   economic   activity published  by  the  Bank  of  Portugal,  economic  activity decelerated  to  an  annualised  growth  rate  of    ½%  (as against  1.7%  for  the  whole  of  2001).  Judging  by  the most recent indicators, domestic demand waned further in  the  third  quarter.  Output  growth  is  expected  to continue  to  decelerate  until  the  beginning  of  2003.  For the  whole  of  2002,  GDP  growth  is  expected  at  around ¾%.   A   moderate   pick-up   in   economic   activity   is forecast   to   take   place   in   2003,   brought   about   by favourable  developments  abroad,  which  is  expected  to strengthen the current process of substituting the major source  of  growth  towards  the  export  sector  and  away from   domestic   demand.   However,   in   view   of   the negative  overhang  in  economic  growth  at  the  end  of 2002,  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  reach  only  about 1¼%  in  2003  before  accelerating  to  an  annual  rate  of some  2½%  in  2004.  Although  gaining  momentum, domestic  demand  is  forecast  to  expand  at  an  annual average of just over 1% in 2003-04. This is mainly due to  continued  efforts  by  private  sector  agents  to  redress their   balance   sheets,   following   the   sharp   rise   in indebtedness  in  recent  years.  The  balance  of  payments deficit  (the  sum  of  the  current  and  capital  balances)  is therefore  expected  to  nearly  halve  between  2001  and 2004, declining to a value close to 4% of GDP in 2004. GDP components Private  consumption  is  expected  to  remain  subdued throughout the forecast period. Consumer confidence is currently  at  historically  low  levels,  and  households  are expected  to  use  a  substantial  part  of  the  growth  in  real disposable income to reduce their debt-to-income ratios. Total  investment  is  forecast  to  decline  further  in  2003 as  the  adjustment  of  private  capital  spending  to  more sustainable  levels  continues,  and  public  investment  not co-financed  by  EU  funds  is  reduced  in  nominal  terms due    to    budgetary    constraints.    Growth    in    total investment is only expected to turn positive in 2004. Export market growth is estimated to accelerate sharply from ½% in 2002 to approximately 6½% on average in the  2003-04  period.  The  strong  rebound  in  foreign demand is expected to lead to a strong rise in exports as market    shares    are    projected    to    remain    broadly unchanged  in  2003-04  after  the  gains  registered  in 2001-02.  The  total  import  elasticity  of  final  demand  is estimated  to  decline  in  2002,  because  of  the  marked slowdown  in  demand  for  durables  which  have  a  high import  content.  With  the  revival  of  investment  and exports,  the  import  elasticity  should  edge  up  again  at the end of the forecast period. Overall, the contribution of  total  net  exports  to  GDP  growth  is  forecast  to  be close to ¾ pp over the forecast period. External Balance The  external  deficit,  as  measured  by  the  sum  of  the current and capital balances, is projected to nearly halve between 2001 and 2004, declining to a ratio close to 4% of   GDP.   The   narrowing   of   the   external   imbalance reflects   the   slowdown   in   the   growth   of   domestic demand  combined  with  the  expected  normalisation  in capital transfers resulting from the implementation of a new  Community  Support  Framework,  which  should more   than   offset   the   projected   deterioration   in   the incomes balance. Prices Despite a 2 pp rise in the standard VAT rate to 19% as from   July   2002,   HICP   inflation   has   only   slightly increased  since,  suggesting  that  producers  have  only partly   passed   through   to   consumers   the   VAT   rise, thereby reducing profit margins. Moderate import price inflation,  low  wage  increases,  and  subdued  domestic demand throughout the forecast period are all expected to  contribute  to  dampen  inflation  from  about  3½%  in 2002 to a projected 2½% in 2004 Labour Market Employment  should  still  grow  in  2002,  in  particular  in the    construction    and    services    sectors,    while    the unemployment  rate  is  forecast  to  rise  to  4¾%.  The slowdown   in   economic   activity   will   have   a   more marked  impact  on  labour  market  outcomes  in  2003. Employment  is  projected  to  nearly  stagnate,  reflecting both the economic slowdown together with the freeze in public    sector    hiring.    The    unemployment    rate    is expected  to  reach  some  5½%  in  2003.  However,  the easing   in   labour   market   conditions   combined   with possible  spill-over  effects  from  the  planned  lower  pay rises  in  the  public  sector  are  expected  to  bring  about lower   wage   increases   in   the   private   sector   of   the economy.  Total  wage  gains  per  employee  are  expected to decelerate from about 4¾ % in 2002 to 3½% in 2004. Public finances Public    finance    data    for    Portugal    were    revised significantly   after   the   Spring   forecast,   resulting   in higher   government   deficits.   These   revisions   were reported   in   the   September   EDP   notification,   and basically  follow  the  conclusions  reached  by  an  ad-hoc commission,    which    had    been    entrusted    by    the Portuguese  government  to  review  general  government accounts  for  2001.  Since  taking  office  in  April  2002, the   Portuguese   government   introduced   a   rectifying budget  which  included  saving  measures  totalling  about ½% of GDP. The  deficit  target  for  2002  is  2.8%  of  GDP.  However, and  according  to  the  latest   information,   the   actual deficit outturn for 2002 is currently estimated at around 3½%  of  GDP.  The  higher  figure  reflects  a  number  of factors,  notably:  lower  growth  than  projected  in  the rectifying   budget   (¾%   as   against   1¼%),   which   is depressing  tax  revenue  below  target;  less  favourable developments    as    regards    health    care    and    local authorities  expenditure;  and  a  likely  shortfall  in  the revenue  intake  from  the  planned  sale  of  real  assets, which were expected to bring in a total of about ¾% of GDP; in particular the current estimate does not include the announced sale of the fixed telephone network. The  forecast  for  2003  is  based  on  the  draft  budget  for that   year.   Among   the   most   significant   measures included  in  the  budget  are:  i)  personal  income  tax brackets   are   indexed   below   inflation;   ii)   half-year minimum payments on account of final corporate taxes are raised substantially; iii) the average inflation rate in the EU will be used as the benchmark in all future wage negotiations  in  the  public  sector;  iv)  a  vast  programme of privatisation is planned to bring in € 1500 million in revenue  of  which  40%  is  to  be  used  to  repay  public debt;  v)  government  transfers  will  continue  to  grow above  nominal  GDP,  partly  due  to  the  decision  to progressively  raise  the  minimum  pension  towards  the minimum   wage.   The   resulting   forecast   is   a   deficit slightly below 3% of GDP, which however is above the budgetary   target   of   2.4%.   The   difference   mainly reflects:  lower  growth  than  assumed  in  the  budget forecast  (1¼%  as  against  1¾%);  and  the  carry  over effect from the deficit slippage estimated for 2002.		
November/2002	Finland	Overcoming the drag from external weakness and de-stocking	Economy in 2002 Finland  was  severely  hit  by  the  slump  in  international trade  last  year.  As  a  consequence,  following  growth  of 0.7%  in  2001,  the  economy  slipped  into  a  technical recession  by  the  turn  of  the  year.  Apart  from  foreign demand,   this   was   also   due   to   a   substantial   stock correction.  Final  domestic  demand  slackened,  too.  The rebound  in  the  second  quarter  of  2002  was  remarkably strong,  with  real  GDP  increasing  by  2.1%  quarter-on- quarter. The driving force behind this hike was external demand  leading  to  exports  soaring  by  4.4%  on  the quarter.  Furthermore,  final  domestic  demand  resumed its rising trend. Both private and public consumption as well  as  equipment  investment  recorded  an  acceleration in  the  course  of  the  Spring.  However,  construction activity eased on the back of weaker demand prospects. Inventories were further adjusted downwards, owing to relatively   large   de-stocking   in   manufacturing   but especially due to ship deliveries. Although  activity  has  been  subdued,  net  employment creation   remained   on   a   rising   path   recording   a cumulative  growth  of  0.4%  year-on-year  in  the  first nine  months  of  2002.  This  implies  of  some  labour hoarding,   reflecting   healthy   financial   balances   and relatively  strong  confidence  in  the  corporate  sector. Nevertheless,  as  labour  supply  continues  to  grow,  the downward  trend  in  unemployment  has  stopped.  From an  average  rate  of  9.1%  in  2001,  unemployment  edged up to 9.2% (s.a.) between January and September 2002. Inflation (HICP) eased quickly from an average of 2.7% in  2001  to  1.4%  in  September  2002.  This  was  mainly due  to  the  fading  of  shocks  from  higher  prices  of  food and  housing.  However,  prices  of  services,  in  particular of  health  care  and  recreation,  continue  to  exert  upward pressure. Prospects Leading  indicators  point  to  a  somewhat  mixed  outlook for the last months of 2002. Therefore, activity is set to advance at a moderate pace in the second half of 2002, resulting  in  an  average  growth  of  about  1½%  in  2002. Against  the  background  of  an  assumed  recovery  in foreign    demand    and    continued    healthy    domestic demand, a pick-up in activity is expected by the second half  of  2003,  accelerating  the  annual  rate  of  GDP growth to 2¾% in 2003 and further to 3½% in 2004. Following  from  the  projected  profile  of  activity,  job creation is expected to come to a halt in the last months of  2002,  implying  employment  remaining  flat  for  the year  as  a  whole.  As  a  consequence,  a  small  rise  in unemployment  is  forecast  for  2002.  For  the  future,  the delayed  recovery  and  spare  capacity  in  the  corporate sector is expected to hold back job creation. Therefore, employment is projected to hover around current levels throughout  2003.  Nevertheless,  hiring  should  not  face major supply constraints, given the continued decline in the NAIRU and the fact that the level of unemployment is expected to remain above the EU average throughout the forecast period. GDP components Owing to a relatively high export share of close to 40% of  GDP,  Finland  has  suffered  significantly  from  the weakness  in  external  demand.  In  spite  of  high  price competitiveness  of  Finnish  firms,  external  demand  is not expected to give a major boost to growth before the second  half  of  2003.  In  2004,  net  exports  should  raise GDP  by  over  1  percentage  point  owing  particularly  to lively  foreign  demand  for  Finnish  telecommunication and   forest   products.   Easing   inflation   together   with expected sizeable nominal wage rises in 2003-04 should help  consumer  spending  to  maintain  its  leading  role  as the driver of the economy. However, the tax cuts of the recent past seem to have come to an end and some rises of   social   security   contributions   have   already   been introduced.   Furthermore,   the   expected   increase   in unemployment   may   dampen   private   consumption. Owing to low capacity utilisation rates and weak export demand,   business   investment   is   expected   to   stay subdued   up   to   the   second   half   of   2003.   In   2004, improving  demand  prospects  should  boost  investment activity. Rising vacancy rates for business premises are pr ojected to weigh on business construction throughout the  forecast  period.  On  the  other  hand,  favourable financing    conditions    together    with    the    ongoing migration towards the  growth centres of the country are expected  to  stimulate  hous ing  construction  which  was sluggish in 2001-02. Costs and prices Although  activity  is  expected  to  gradually  pick  up, lower  food  and  housing  prices  are  estimated  to  reduce price pressures, bringing HICP inflation down by about ¾ percentage points to just below 2% in 2002. In 2003, the base effect is estimated to pave the way for slightly lower  average  inflation.  In  2004,  projected  pick-up  in activity  imply    a  soft  acceleration  in  price  inflation.  In December 2000, a centralised two-year wage agreement provided for a general wage rise of 2.3% in 2002. Due to  a  positive  wage  drift,  per-capita  wages  appear  to increase  by  about  3¼%  in  2002.  However,  nearly  flat employment in 2002-03 appears to curb the rise in unit labour costs due to a rise in overall productivity. As for wages  in  2003-04,  a  new  round  of  centralised  wage negotiation  started  in  mid-October.  Initial  wage  claims are for an  increase close to 4% for 2003 and about 3½ %  for  2004.  Even  allowing  for  the  fact  that  actual settlements  will  turnout  significantly  lower  than  initial claims,  upward  pressure  on  labour  costs  appears  to  be building up, assuming also unabated wage drift of about 1 percentage point.

C h a p t e r 3 Member States, Finland 79 - Public finances Although  the  general  government  financial  surplus  is expected  to  decrease  by  about  1¼  percentage  points  to some  3½  %  of  GDP  in  2002,  it  is  projected  to  exceed the estimate of the Spring forecast. This results from an improved  overall  revenue  intake,  and  particularly  from higher  social  contributions  due  to  lower-than-expected unemployment.       However,       central       government expenditure  is  also  projected  to  grow  beyond  the  rate agreed   in   the   government’s   medium-term   spending guidelines  of  Spring  2002.  This  goes  in  particular  for expenditure    on    social    transfers.    In    addition,    the financial  position  of  local  governments  appears  to  slip further into deficit, due partly to reforms in the financial burden sharing between the state and the municipalities but   more   importantly   to   additional   expenditure   on welfare    services    and    local    government    wages. Consequently,   the   general   government   surplus   is estimated to edge down further to some 3% of GDP in 2003  while  the  stronger  economic  activity  is  expected to bring it back to around 3½ % in 2004. In  2003  and  2004,  the  trend  of  a  mildly  rising  nominal government debt is expected to continue. This is due to a  decline  in  the  primary  surplus  in  2003  and  to  the ongoing    reduction    in    the    holdings    of    domestic government   bonds   by   social   security   funds.   As   a consequence   of   the   expected   acceleration   of   GDP growth, the debt ratio is an ticipated  to  fall  gradually  to just  above  41%  of  GDP  by  the  end  of  the  forecast period.		
November/2002	Sweden	Private consumption contributes to stronger growth in 2002	The economy in 2002 Swedish  economic  growth  has  shown  resilience  so  far in 2002, with GDP growth of 1.5% year-on-year in the first half of 2002 compared with 1.2% in the year 2001. Despite  the  fact  that  exports  have  remained  weak,  the contribution  to  growth  from  net  exports  was  highly positive, due to very low imports. The prolonged global slump  in  the  telecom  sector  has  weighed  heavily  on Swedish exports and in particular on manufacturing. On the  domestic  side,  economic  activity  has  been  mixed. Private  consumption  accelerated  in  Q2  and  was  up  by 1%  on  the  quarter,  aided  by  an  increase  in  disposable incomes.  Lower  taxes,  a  resilient  labour  market  and relatively  strong  consumer  confidence  has  contributed to  this.  On  the  other  hand,  share  prices  have  continued to  fall  substantially  in  2002.  This  led  households  to increase  the  saving  rate.  Investment  has  been  poor, influenced by uncertain business prospects. De-stocking continued  in  the  first  half  of  2002.  By  contrast,  public consumption has risen strongly. With some acceleration in  GDP  and  at  the  same  time  almost  flat  employment growth,   productivity   growth   per   person   has   risen sharply. Prospects Recent  indicators  point  to  the  economy  being  in  the middle  of  a  very  hesitant  recovery.  Both  business  and consumer confidence indicators suggest that one cannot expect  much  in  the  way  of  acceleration  in  the  very short-term.   Indications   of   a   recovery   in   the   world economy  also  appear  to  be  uncertain.  These  prospects, both domestically and externally, are expected to result in relatively stable growth in the second half of 2002. A further  recovery  is  expected  in  2003,  with  some  rise  in private  consumption  and  a  turnaround  in  investment. External   demand   growth   should   pick   up   in   2003, resulting in stronger exports. In 2004, economic growth is  expected  to  be  close  to  potential.  Overall,  GDP  is expected  to  grow  by  1.6%  in  2002,  2.2%  in  2003  and 2.4% in 2004. Inflation  is  expected  to  remain  stable  over  the  forecast period,  close  to  the  Riksbank’s  inflation  target  of  2%. On  balance,  upside  risks  from,  possibly,  higher  wage increases  are  countered  by  downside  risks  stemming from  the  turbulence  in  asset  prices.  The  labour  market is fairly tight and is expected to be stable in 2002-04. GDP components The   substantial   tax   cuts   in   2002   raises   disposable incomes  markedly,  actually  the  biggest  increase  in  real terms in more than 30 years, and should result in much stronger  private  consumption  growth,  of  1.4%,  after having  grown  be  a  mere  0.2%  in  2001.  Despite  this acceleration   in   consumption,   the   prolonged   fall   in equity prices, in fact larger between 2000 and 2002 than during  the  depression  in  1929-32,  results  in  negative wealth  effects,  despite  continued,  slight  rises  in  house prices.  This  should  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  savings rate  of  almost  3  percentage  points  in  2002.  These negative    wealth    effects    are    expected    to    subdue somewhat in 2003 and further in 2004, suggesting some increase  in  private  consumption.  Investment  growth  is expected  to  be  negative  in  2002,  as  business  prospects are  very  uncertain.  In  2003,  investment  is  expected  to be subdued too, although investment in housing and 3G telecom    networks    should    contribute    to    positive investment  growth  overall.  A  further  rise  in  investment is   foreseen   for   2004,   as   economic   activity   gathers momentum.    Stocks    are    expected    to    contribute negatively  to  growth  again  in  2002,  but  should  turn around in 2003 and give a positive contribution in 2003. As  external  demand  growth  has  improved  in  2002, Swedish exports, comprising more than ICT equipment, are  set  to  turn  positive,  after  having  fallen  in  2001.  In 2003   and   2004,   a   further   recovery   in   exports   is expected,   in   line   with   world   markets.   Imports   too should pickup, although remaining negative in 2002, as final demand recovers in 2003 and 2004. Costs and prices Inflation  has  eased  considerably  since  the  beginning  of this  year  and  has  been  around  2%  in  recent  months,  in an    environment    of    relatively    subdued    economic activity.  Existing  wage  agreements  suggest  increases below  4%.  However,  due  to  a  relatively  tight  labour market,  some  wage  drift  and  some,  possible,  upward pressure  on  wages  resulting  from  re-negotiations  for certain sectors, wages are expected to be around 4% in 2002-2004.  As  productivity  growth  is  expected  to  be close to 2% over the forecast period, wage increases of around 4% should be compatible with inflation close to the  Riksbank’s  2%  target.  Inflation  is  expected  to  be slightly above 2% over the forecast period. Labour market Employment  growth  has  eased  during  2002  and  is expected  to  be  marginally  positive  for  the  year.  Some evidence  suggests  that  there  has  been  an  element  of labour  hoarding  this  year.  The  gradual  recovery  in economic  activity  is  therefore  not  expected  to  result  in any additional employment growth in 2003. The labour force  is  expected  to  expand  moderately  in  2003,  which will result in a slight increase in the unemployment rate. In  2004,  some  employment  growth  is  expected,  as economic activity gains momentum. Public finances Swedish public finances have been in surplus each year since 1998 and an increase in the surplus was posted in 2001, to 4.8% of GDP. The fiscal policy framework has contributed  to  the  strong  fiscal  position.  In  2002,  the surplus in public finances is expected to be much lower. Relatively subdued economic growth and additional tax cuts  of  the  order  of  1.1%  of  GDP  contributes  to  this. Moreover, the absence of positive carry-over effects on tax  revenue  in  the  National  Accounts  system,  resulting from   lower   corporate   and   capital   gain   taxes   being recorded  in  2002,  has  an  effect  on  the  large  decline  in the  budget  balance  this  year.  On  the  expenditure  side, the government remains committed to the previously set expenditure    ceilings    on    central    government,    as announced  in  the  Budget  Bill  for  2003.  However,  the budgetary  margins  within  the  expenditure  ceilings  are very small and expenditure in some expenditure areas, such as sick insurance expenditure, could be higher than planned. In addition, the high inflation rate in June 2001 increases indexed transfer payments in 2002. Despite   the   very   narrow   margins   in   the   central government expenditure plans over the forecast period, the  use  of  ceilings  remains  a  very  important  tool  for medium-term  budgetary  planning.  This  helps  keeping the public finances in good shape and budget surpluses of close to 1.5% of GDP are expected over the forecast period.  Gross  debt  was  56.6%  of  GDP  in  2001.  The debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  expected  to  fall  over  the  forecast period  and  reach  around  50%  of  GDP  in  2004,  as  the budget surpluses described above take effect		
November/2002	United Kingdom	Back to trend growth by 2003, as investment and net exports revive	The economy in 2002 The  British  economy  is  weathering  the  recent  global economic  downturn  rather  well.  Although  performance was   weak   in   the   latter   half   of   2001,   with   two consecutive quarters of near-stagnant growth in 2001Q4 and  2002Q1,  recent  data  reveals  that  the  economy  is growing again as household consumption has remained especially  strong.  The  UK  is  benefiting  from  monetary loosening  in  the  shape  of  a  2%  cumulative  cut  in  the repo  rate  since  the  beginning  of  2001,  and  a  fiscal stimulus   in   the   form   of   planned   rises   in   general government spending. It  should  be  noted  that  the  celebrations  of  the  Queen’s Jubilee  affected  a  variety  of  indicators  for  May  and June,  and  thus  Q2  as  a  whole,  though  preliminary  data for Q3 suggests respectable growth for the two quarters taken as a whole. Although  household  expenditure  was  subdued  early  in 2002,  it  has  since  picked  up  so  that,  together  with  net exports, it was the biggest contributor to GDP growth in Q2.   Fixed   investment,   already   declining   throughout 2001, flattened out in 2002Q2. This was the first time in 5  quarters  that  fixed  investment  did  not  contribute negatively    to    GDP    growth.    General    government consumption  was  the  second-largest  drag  on  growth  in Q2  after  having  been  the  largest  contributor  to  GDP growth  in  Q1.  De-stocking  accelerated  during  Q2  and proved to be the largest negative contributor to growth. Net exports of goods and services improved during the first half of this year, due to a rebound in export growth in  Q2  while  import  growth  declined.  Net  exports  thus contributed 0.9%-points to GDP growth in Q2, the first time they had contributed positively since 2001Q1. On   the   output   side,   services   output   became   more subdued  in  the  first  half  of  2002,  construction  grew strongly,  but  manufacturing  output  continued  to  fall, despite  rising  exports.  The  labour  market  has  stayed strong  but  productivity  growth  was  low.  Inflationary pressures  remain  low  -  on  the  HICP  measure,  inflation is at 1.0%, around the lowest in the EU. RPIX inflation has remained below the 2½ % target since January. Prospects Growth  for  2002  on  average  should  be  around  1.6%, with the rate rising to 2.7%, around trend, in 2004. The pickup in external factors this year, which began in Q2, is    expected    to    continue    boosting    exports.    The contribution   of   the   net   external   balance   to   annual growth  is  expected  to  be  less  negative  from  2003 onwards  than  in  previous  years.  Meanwhile,  domestic demand is expected to remain strong, in part as a result of macro-economic policy. With growth below trend in 2002,  a  small  negative  output  gap  will  emerge  so supply constraints, overall, should not constrain growth. Unemployment  is  expected  to  fall  slightly  by  2004. Although a slight pick-up in wage increases is expected, a pick up in productivity growth is expected, so rises in unit labour costs will be subdued. GDP components Growth  in  household  consumption  is  expected  to  be maintained  over  the  forecast  period,  albeit  below  the rapid rates observed in 2001 and the first half of 2002. Real  wage  earnings  are  expected  to  grow  moderately and  disposable  incomes  continue  to  benefit  from  low interest rates. The rise in house prices, currently racing along  at  over  20%  per  year,  is  offsetting  the  negative impact  the  recent  falls  in  equity  markets  may  have  on consumption  out  of  wealth.  Nevertheless,  the  falls  in financial    wealth    associated    with    equity    market weakness,   combined   with   the   rise   in   gross   debt associated  with  the  strength  in  the  housing  market  are expected to affect the savings rate, raising it by the end of  the  forecast  period.  2003  will  see  a  reversal  in  the current  decline  of  fixed  investment,  benefiting  from strong     planned     boosts     to     general     government investment and an end to the fall in business investment in  line  with  a  revival  in  business  expectations  and  a  b etter   financial   position   of   companies.   Government consumption    will    continue    to    be    an    important contributor   to   demand   growth,   as   planned.   Export growth   is   expected   to   recover   steadily   during   the forecast  period.  Import  growth  will  be  a  little  weaker than  export  growth,  reflecting  the  lower  growth  in domestic demand compared to 2001. Labour Market The  labour  market  has  remained  strong  despite  the global slowdown, with the unemployment rate hitting a twenty seven year low this year. Rises in wage earnings continue   to   be   moderate.   Employment   has   grown moderately,  and  in  the  three  months  to  August  rose  by 0.7%  on  the  year.  This  trend  is  expected  to  continue, leading  to  a  slight  decline  in  unemployment  by  2004. This  year,  productivity  growth  is  expected  to  start recovering from its low rate observed in 2001, given the stronger expected GDP growth, and an expected tighter labour market. Unit labour costs rises are expected to be moderate and sustainable over the forecast period. External balance The   current   account   deficit   is   expected   to   shrink throughout  the  forecast  period  to  around  1.6%  of  GDP by  2004.  The  negative  contribution  of  net  exports  of goods and services to GDP growth in 2002 is expected to  decline  over  the  forecast  period  as  UK  overseas markets show good growth.

Public finances The general government finances are expected to move into small deficit over the period. The surplus of 0.7 % of GDP in 2001 will fall to a deficit of around 1.1 % of GDP in 2002 as growth is slower in the year as a whole; some  tax  revenues,  notably  corporation  tax,  are  weak, while discretionary expenditure growth rises strongly as planned.  The  deficit  is  expected  to  rise  gently  to  1.4  % by 2004, as strong planned rises in expenditure in those years   will   be   broadly   offset   by   rises   in   social contributions. The ratio of gross debt to GDP will fall to under 38 % by the end of 2004		
April/2003	Belgium	Deceleration in activity linked to the cycle in the Eurozone	Economic situation and prospects The business cycle in the open economy of Belgium is closely  linked  to  that  of  its  main  European  partners,  in particular  those  of  the  euro  zone.  Since  2001,  slower activity   and   weaker   demand   in   the   neighbouring countries, was accompanied by a sharp fall in real GDP growth  in  Belgium:  after  being  particularly  strong  in 2000,  the  increase  in  real  GDP  decelerated  to  0.8%  in 2001  and  0.7%  in  2002.  In  2001,  the  quarterly  profile was  particularly  weak,  ending  by  a  decline  of  0.5%  in the fourth quarter. A mild recovery was registered at the beginning of 2002 but the improvement remained weak throughout  the  year  and  real  GDP  growth  reached barely 0.2% in the fourth quarter. Declining confidence due  to  external  developments  and  uncertainties  related to geopolitical developments and oil prices are currently delaying prospects of economic recovery: the trough of the cycle is postponed to the end of Spring, two quarters later  than  expected  in  Autumn.  The  synthetic  indicator of  the  Belgian  National  Bank,  which  reflects  the  short term  fundamental  trend,  was  still  deteriorating  at  the beginning  of  2003.  Real  GDP  growth  is  forecast  to reach  1.2%  in  2003  and  2.3%  in  2004,  under  the assumption  of  improving  external  prospects.  However, significant  risks  weigh  on  this  forecast,  all  of  them stemming from external developments. GDP components In  2002,  private  consumption  was  restricted  by  the increase in unemployment, registered as from 2001 and from  worsening  expectations;  some  improvement  in confidence  indicators  in  the  course  of  the  year  did  not last.  In  March  2003,  the  consumer  confidence  index was   at   its   lowest   since   2001,   due   to   negative expectations   concerning   economic   and   employment prospects    as    well    as    the    financial    situation    of households. As employment is expected to recover only in late 2003, with delay as against resuming activity, the saving   ratio   is   forecast   to   remain   at   a   high   level throughout the period. Improvement in world economic activity  should  be  translated  progressively  into  higher confidence  and  stronger  consumption  in  the  course  of the  second  half  of    2003  and  in  2004.  In  view  of  the uncertain     external     environment,     weak     demand conditions   and   particularly   low   capacity   utilisation, productive   investment   was   particularly   subdued   in 2002.  In  2003,  improvement  in  export  markets  and  in domestic   demand   are   expected   to   foster   private investment  which  should  gradually  strengthen  during the  year  and  continue  in  2004.  Exports,  which  have been weakening since 2001, should recover in 2003 as a result of recovery in world trade; however, the effective appreciation   of   the   euro   will   result   presumably   in market   shares   losses   outside   the   euro   area,   while exports   to   the   neighbouring   euro   partners   are   not expected   to   recover   strongly.   Recovery   in   Belgian external trade is therefore expected to be relatively slow and  contribution  to  real  GDP  growth  from  external demand should be modest. Labour market, costs and prices Robust  progress  in  employment  is  not  foreseen  in  the course  of  2003  and,  on  average,  it  is  expected  to continue to decline slightly. As some improvement will be  registered  in  the  last  part  of  the  year,  strengthening in  the  course  of  2004,  increase  in  total  employment might reach 0.7% in that year. The unemployment rate, which  has  been  on  a  slow  but  continuous  increasing path  since  2001,  will  continue  to  rise  in  2003  and stabilise in 2004. Costs   and   prices   perspectives   can   be   considered relatively  positive.  Imported  inflation  is  expected  to  be offset  for  a  large  part  by  the  appreciation  of  the  euro; the  oil  bill,  in  particular,  invoiced  in  dollars,  should  be alleviated  by  the  exchange  rate  effect.  However,  this assumption   encompasses   significant   risks   related   to unpredictable  surges  in  oil  prices  or  to  oil  production disruptions.  As  far  as  internal  costs  are  concerned,  the framework  nominal  wage  agreement  for  the  private sector,  which  covers  the  years  2003-2004,  is  aiming  at preserving  cost  competitiveness  in  Belgium,  taking  as benchmark   the   three   main   economic   partners   of Belgium. A norm for nominal wage increases was set at 5.4% for the whole period 2003 and 2004, which, when compared  with  the  6.4%  limit  set  by  the  previous agreement   covering   2001   and   2002,   reflects   some resumed   wage   moderation.   Sectoral   agreements   are expected to be rather moderated in 2003, particularly in view  of  the  situation  on  the  labour  market;  higher increases might be delayed to 2004. In 2002, underlying inflation decelerated sharply, partly due to the abolition of the television license fee in Flanders and Brussels but also   due   to   weakening   demand   and   import   prices. Reduction  in  inflation  is  expected  to  continue  in  2003 and  2004  as  a  result  of  easing  domestic  cost  pressures and    limited    increases    in    non-oil    import    prices. However,   in   this   respect,   large   uncertainties   exist related to oil prices. Public finances In   2002,   despite   macroeconomic   developments   less supportive  than  assumed  in  the  budget,  the  general government  accounts  reached  a  small  surplus  of  0.1  % of GDP. Budgetary control exercises were organised in March  and  July  associating  all  levels  of  government. Expenditure   was   constrained,   while   in   the   social security  sector,  health  spending,  after  a  strong  increase in  2001,  was  better  controlled.  The  implementation  of the  tax  reform  resulted  in  cuts  in  the  personal  income tax  and  in  a  progressive  phasing  out  of  the  crisis contribution;    social    security    contributions    of    the enterprises  sector  were  reduced  and  some  other  taxes were  eliminated  or  reduced  in  Flanders  and  Brussels. The  fall  in  interest  payments  cushioned  the  negative effect  of  decelerating  fiscal  revenues.  The  fall  in  the government  debt  ratio,  which  had  decelerated  in  2001, resumed in 2002 and its level was reduced to 105.3% if GDP. The    2003    budget    announced    further    expenditure restraint while continuing the implementation of the tax reform;   the   latter   would   result   in   further   tax   cuts amounting  to  0.35%  of  GDP  and  in  reducing  tax  rates for  corporations,  a  reduction  which,  combined  with offsetting  measures  will  be  neutral.  Excises  on  tobacco and  some  local  taxes  will  be  raised.  Reaching  balance continues to rely critically on further savings on interest payments,   expected   to   continue   in   2003   as   the government  debt  ratio  declines.  However,  the  2003 budget   was   built   on   a   2.1%   real   GDP   growth assumption;  in  February  this  underlying  projection  was reduced    to    1.4%    while    the    government    balance objective  was  maintained.  Such  an  adjustment  was made   possible   by   further   containment   of   federal expenditure,  applying  the  “anchor  principle”  (holding the utilisation rate of credits under or at the rate of 2001  during  a  number  of  months);  better  than  expected  tax revenues  at  the  end  of  2002  were  also  used  to  fill  the additional  gap.  An  upward  correction  in  savings  on interest payments, due to a more favourable spectrum of interest rates, was also instrumental. Real GDP growth is expected to slow to 1.2% in 2003; consequently,  a  government  deficit  of  0.2%  of  GDP  is forecast  under  the  assumption  of  no  further  adjustment measures.  An  improvement  should  occur  in  2004,  the government  deficit  reaching  0.1%  of  GDP  under  the same  assumption.  At  the  same  time,  the  government debt is expected to continue to decline from 105.3% of GDP in 2002 to 102.7% in 2003 and 98.9% in 2004		
April/2003	Denmark	Riding the tides of the slowdown	The economy in 2002 The  Danish  economy  weathered  to  a  large  extent  the effects  of  the  international  slowdown  in  2002.  Overall, real   GDP   grew   by   1.6%,   mainly   supported   by   a sustained   growth   in   final   domestic   demand.   The quarterly  profile  of  GDP  growth  during  2002  was  very volatile  as  large  movements  in  stocks  to  some  extent disrupted   the   picture.   The   expected   acceleration   in private  consumption  finally  set  in,  primarily  driven  by increases  in  car  sales,  but  also  retail  sales  increased  at stronger   rates.   Investment   growth   remained   largely unchanged   compared   to   2001   at   just   above   1%. Equipment  investment  grew  surprisingly  strongly  in light  of  the  modest  overall  growth  rate,  whereas  non- residential     investment     fell     markedly.     Housing investment  picked  up  a  little  bit  again,  as  house  prices continued to increase. The  volatile  stock  movements  during  the  year  resulted in stocks putting an overall drag of –½ percentage point on   GDP   growth.   These   stock   developments   are difficult   to   understand   in   light   of   the   economic developments  during  the  year,  and  it  seems  likely  that they include some statistical discrepancies.   Exports  held  up  very  well  in  spite  of  the  international slowdown.  Exports  of  goods  grew  by  more  than  4%  in real terms, primarily due to a favourable composition of goods,  as  many  of  the  goods  exported  are  not  very sensitive  to  the  cycle,  and  a  reorientation  in  export markets.  Imports  grew  somewhat  less  than  exports, resulting in a growth contribution from net exports of ½ percentage   point.   Furthermore,   the   current   account registered another high surplus.    Inflation showed more resilience than expected. After a small decline in the beginning of the year, inflation has come up again and ended the year at the same level as it began.   Prospects The immediate outlook for the Danish economy is for a moderate  growth  rate  in  2003  of  1½%  accelerating  to just  over  2%  in  2004.  In  both  years  final  domestic demand is expected to be driving growth, primarily led by  increases  in  private  consumption  on  the  back  of sustained  increases  in  real  disposable  incomes  and  the tax reform announced for 2004.  The  Danish  economy  continues  to  be  well  balanced. Both  public  finances  and  the  current  account  are  in large  surpluses.  Compared  to  previous  forecasts,  the situation   on   the   labour   market   has   eased,   thereby reducing the risks of overheating. GDP components  Private  consumption  is  expected  to  continue  to  show healthy,   but   slightly   lower   growth   rates   in   2003 compared  to  2002,  as  disposable  incomes  are  set  to increase   slightly   less   and   inflation   remains   at   a relatively   high   level.   In   2004,   the   effects   of   the announced     tax     reform     should     refuel     private consumption   to   a   growth   rate   above   2%.   Overall investment  is  likely  to  remain  subdued  in  the  first  half of  2003  and  then  increase  gradually  in  the  second  half and  into  2004.  Housing  investment  is  increasing  in  the entire   forecast   period,   partly   as   a   result   of   policy induced increases. The large depletion of stocks in 2001 and   2002   should   come   to   an   end   and   positive contributions to GDP growth from stock are expected in both forecast years. Exports  have  to  some  extent  so  far  been  sheltered against  the  international  slowdown,  but  the  line  is  to  a large  degree  expected  to  run  out  for  these  special factors  as  the  slowdown  has  turned  out  to  be  longer than  expected.  Furthermore,  the  appreciation  of  the krone    and   the   continued   high   wage   increase   put pressure on competitiveness, resulting in loss of market shares  in  both  years.  Exports  are  therefore  expected  to grow only by 2% in 2003, increasing to just below 5% in 2004. Imports should grow broadly in line with final demand, resulting in a small negative contribution from net exports in both years.    Costs and prices The   resilience   in   inflation   is   expected   to   continue during most of 2003, as core inflation remains high and the  oil  price  is  increasing.  From  October  1  2003,  a reduction  in  excise  duties  on  strong  alcohol,  tobacco and   soft   drinks   is   implemented   –   equivalent   to   a reduction  of  the  inflation  rate  by  ¼  percentage  point. Most  of  the  effect  of  the  reduction  will  only  be  visible in 2004, where inflation is set to decrease also, as result of  the  falling  oil  price.  Core  inflation  is,  however,  not expected   to   decrease   markedly   over   the   forecast horizon, as wage increases remain high. Labour market  The    recent    increase    in    the    number    of    people unemployed  is  expected  to  continue  during  most  of 2003 with the turn-around setting in during the autumn. However,   compared   to   previous   downturns   in   the economy,  the  increase  in  unemployment  is  still  only marginal, and it is not expected to affect the increase in wages  markedly,  as  wage  increases  are  set  to  remain fairly  constant  around  4%  the  entire  forecast  period. Employment  creation  is  set  to  increase  again  during 2003 after employment fell in 2002. Overall,   the   Danish   labour   market   is   expected   to continue    to    remain    tight.    However,    the    recent developments  in  unemployment  and  employment  has reduced the risk of over-heating.  Public finances  The  general  government  balance  showed  a  surplus  of 2.0%  of  GDP  in  2002.  In  2003,  a  slightly  smaller surplus  of  1.8%  of  GDP  is  expected  as  the  larger unemployment  increases  transfers  to  households  and lowers growth rates of some tax revenues. In 2004, the surplus  is  set  to  increase  to  2.1%  of  GDP,  despite  the implementation  of  a  tax  reform  which  lowers  taxes  on earned  income  by  0.4%  of  GDP.  The  increase  stems from the revenue lost by the tax reform being more than out-weighed  by  the  positive  effects  on  public  finances by  the  increased  GDP  growth  and  by  the  fact  that  the pension fund yield tax, which has hardly generated any revenue   since   2000   as   a   result   of   the   prolonged downturn in the stock market, should generate revenues amounting  to  approximately  ½%  of  GDP.  This  is  half the  revenue  expected  in  a  year  with  “normal”  stock market   developments,   thereby   reflecting   the   carry- forward  of  negative  tax-balances.  The  tax  reform  has been taken into the forecast in the way it was specified in the proposal from the government. The  debt,  which  currently  stands  at  45%  of  GDP  is expected  to  be  reduced  to  40%  of  GDP  by  the  end  of 2004.		
April/2003	Germany	Stagnation extending into the third year	The economy in 2002 Barely a year after the last contraction, quarterly growth stagnated  again  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2002,  in  an economic   environment   combining   a   high   level   of uncertainty  related  to  the  outcome  of  the  war  in  Iraq with   a   structurally   weak   economy.   Already   much earlier,  in  the  second  half  of  2000,  growth  in  Germany had  come  to  a  virtual  standstill.  Average  quarterly growth  since  then  has  been  less  than  0.1%.  Despite quarterly growth rates of ¼% in the first to third quarter of 2002 overall GDP last year was merely 0.2% higher than in 2001, which already disappointed with a growth rate of only 0.6%.  Hopes that the long stagnation would soon be overcome have been dashed. Growth in 2002 was positive only as a  result  of  a  large  external  contribution  in  the  order  of 1.5 % of GDP, because rising exports combined with a sharp   fall   in   imports.   The   latter   reflected   strongly contracting   domestic   demand,   which   fell   by   1.5%. Contraction   was   particularly   marked   for   equipment investment, which was more than 9% below the already low 2001 level. This added to the nearly 6% decline in the  construction  sector  and  the  0.6%  fall  in  private consumption.  Only  public  consumption  posted  a  slight increase, largely as a result of an unplanned strong rise in health care expenditures.   Prospects The  economic  situation  at  the  beginning  of  2003  is hardly  changed  from  that  of  the  end  of  last  year. Growth  is  expected  to  be  zero  in  the  first  quarter  and might  even  be  negative  again  in  the  second  quarter. Uncertainty  about  the  Iraq  war,  high  oil  prices  and  a strong   euro   dampen   hopes   for   an   export   driven- recovery.  This  is  also  reflected  in  persistently  low business  confidence  indicators,  which  recently  started falling  again  after  notching  up  slightly  around  the  turn of the year.    In  the  light  of  the  difficult  international  environment, and due to the fact that the strong import decline of last year  is  set  to  reverse,  a  pick-up  in  economic  activity, would   therefore   have   to   rely   largely   on   domestic impulses.  This  might  be  possible  in  the  second  half  of the  year,  if  the  military  conflict  in  Iraq  turns  out  to  be benign.   However,   domestic   impulses   are   likely   to remain  weak,  because,  as  a  result  of  the  prolonged three-year stagnation and the strong fall in stock market values,   many   companies   need   to   consolidate   their balance  sheets  before  being  able  to  embark  on  major investment programmes. The situation is aggravated by rising  levels  of  bad  debt  and  losses  in  the  German financial  sector,  which  limit  its  lending  capacity,  in particular  to  small  and  medium-size  enterprises.  As  a result,  an  economic  recovery  in  Germany  is  likely  to again lag behind those of other European countries.  Despite  these  potential  risks,  a  restoration  of  consumer and  producer  confidence  could  lead  to  a  revival  of domestic  demand.  The  savings  rate  in  Germany  has risen    substantially    over    the    last    two    years    and equipment investment is nearly one-fifth below its level of  the  middle  of  2000.  A  modest  reversal  of  these strongly  negative  developments  could  bring  about  an acceleration  of  private  consumption  and  investment activity.  There  is  even  hope  that  the  decline  in  the construction  sector,  which  has  been  ongoing  since  the middle of the 1990s, might slow down somewhat.   However,  due  to  an  increase  in  unemployment  by  over 350,000   people   in   2003   and   the   above-mentioned financing  constraints,  a  possible  economic  recovery  is unlikely to develop immediately into a boom. Instead, it should take the form of a relatively modest acceleration of  economic  activity.  The  overall  growth  for  2003  is therefore projected to be below ½ %.  Economic  reforms,  notably  in  the  labour  market,  could potentially    accelerate    a    recovery,    by    increasing economic confidence. However, at the present juncture, those  proposals  that  have  actually  been  passed  as  laws do  not  yet  suffice  to  herald  a  significant  increase  in Germany’s   low   potential   growth,   which   lingers   at around 1½ %. In any case, noticeable effects would be visible at best in 2004.  Despite  a  modest  tax  reduction  as  from  January  2004, the  structural  problems  that  held  Germany  back  in  the previous   three   years   will   therefore   largely   persist. Consequently,   growth   in   2004   will   also   likely   be modest. In calendar-adjusted terms, GDP is projected to increase  at  a  rate  near  Germany’s  potential  growth  of about  1½%.  Actual  growth  should,  however,  attain  a rate  of  around  2%  in  2004,  because  that  year  will  be marked   by   an   unusually   strong   calendar   effect   of around  0.6%.  This  is  due  simply  to  having  a  leap  day (29   February)   and   several   holidays   falling   on   a weekend.  The  pick-up  in  growth  should  translate  into  a  modest relief  for  the  labour  market.  Effective  wage  increases are  likely  to  remain  moderate,  having  no  significant positive or negative impact on job creation.  Inflation  in  Germany  continues  to  be  low.  After  a  rate of 1.4% in 2002 it is expected to slowly fall to 1.3% in 2003   and   1.2%   in   2004.   However,   a   low   rate   of inflation is problematic insofar as the real interest rates in  Germany  remain  above  the  levels  elsewhere  in  the Euro  Area.  On  the  other  hand,  Germany  is  gradually gaining     competitiveness     vis-à-vis     its     European neighbours, which all have higher rates of inflation.

Chapter 3 Member States, Germany 51 Public finances  Following a revised 2001 outcome of 2.8% of GDP, the general  government  deficit  is  currently  estimated  to have reached 3.6% of GDP in 2002. This rise is mostly due to a marked shortfall in tax revenues compared with the   official   May   2002   tax   estimate,   and   another widening  of  the  deficit  in  social  security  sectors.  Not surprisingly,   the   debt   ratio   has   also   breached   the respective Treaty criterion by rising to close to 61% of GDP by end-2002.   While   the   March   2003   notification   by   the   Federal government  implies  a  decline  in  the  nominal  deficit  to 2.8%  of  GDP  in  the  current  year,  the  Commission’s deficit  forecast  is  clearly  more  pessimistic  (3.4%  of GDP).  This  is  first  of  all  due  to  the  fact  that  the Commission forecast for nominal GDP growth in 2003 is  more  than  one  percentage  point  of  GDP  lower  than forecasted  by  the  Federal  government  in  its  Annual Economic  Report  in  January  2003.  Furthermore,  the government’s   deficit   projection   still   incorporates   a considerable  rise  in  tax  revenues  from  the  tax  amnesty and the  ‘Steuervergünstigungsabbaugesetz ’, which was,  however, rejected by the Bundesrat on 14 March and is now    subject    to    discussions    in    the    ‘Mediation Committee’         (Vermittlungsausschuss)         between Bundestag  and  Bundesrat  (Chamber  of  the  Länder). Finally,  the  Commission  forecast  does  not  incorporate all  of  the  expenditure  savings  optimistically  projected by  the  Federal  government  at  the  level  of  the  Federal Labour Office. In 2004, accelerating growth conducive to employment creation  should  make  for  a  more  important  fall  in  the nominal  deficit,  in  spite  of  the  implementation  of  the next  step  of  income  tax  reform  (0.3%  of  GDP).  The debt  ratio,  however,  is  projected  to  rise  further  to  63% of GDP. The   deficit   forecast   for   2004   is   based   on   the assumptions of unchanged social security contributions. Furthermore,  none  of  the  measures  announced  by  the Federal  Chancellor  on  14  March  could  be  taken  into account,  as  some  of  them  are  not  yet  very  specific  or have   not   yet   been   introduced   into   the   legislative procedure		
April/2003	Greece	Slower economic growth with persisting price pressures	The economy in 2002 Domestic economic activity continued to grow at a rate well  above  the  EU  and  euro  area  average,  standing  at 4% in 2002. Strong economic growth was supported by domestic  demand  and  in  particular  by  high  investment spending linked mostly to the preparations for the 2004 Olympic Games. Moreover, the financial flow from the EU   Structural   Funds   was   another   important   factor contributing  to  the  increase  in  investment  at  a  rate higher    than    the    real    GDP    growth    rate.    Private consumption  decelerated  as  a  result  of  the  prevailing economic   uncertainty   as   well   as   persisting   price pressures,  despite  the  beneficial  effect  of  recent  tax reform  on  disposable  income.  On  the  external  sector, the decline in foreign demand led to a further widening of    external  transactions  deficit  due  mainly  to  the significant  decrease  in  exports.  Notwithstanding  strong domestic  activity,  imports  fell  owing  to  the  low  import content of investment spending and decelerating private consumption.     The   situation   in   the   labour   market   has   remained virtually  unchanged  as  strong  domestic  activity  has  not led to employment gains as would have been expected. In  fact,  total  employment  is  estimated  to  have  been reduced by 0.1% in 2002. The unemployment rate stood at  9.9%,  remaining  among  the  highest  in  the  EU  and euro     area.     Furthermore,     the     persisting     high unemployment  rates  of  young  workers  and  females point   to   structural   rigidities   impeding   the   efficient functioning  of  the  labour  market  that  would  ensure moderate wage increases.  In the private sector, the two year wage agreement signed in April 2002 provided for an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  in  two  steps:    3.6% on  1 st   January  2002  and  1.8%  on  1 st   July  2002.  On average,  nominal  wages  are  estimated  to  have  risen  by 6.7% in 2002 while an increase of 5.5% is projected for 2003. Consumer price inflation remained well above the euro area  average  standing  at  3.6%  in  2002.  Bad  weather conditions   resulted   in   food   price   increases   which contributed to the rise of inflation in the first months of the  year.  Price  pressures  eased  temporarily  during  the Summer  months  remaining  however  above  3%  due mainly   to   the   considerable   increase   in   prices   of services.  Furthermore,  underlying  inflation  exceeded the   headline   rate   for   a   second   consecutive   year indicating  the  presence  of  significant  price  pressures emanating apparently from services.  Prospects in 2003 and 2004 The  basic  underlying  assumption  for  the  prospects  of the   Greek   economy   as   they   are   portrayed   in   the forecasts   is   that   strong   growth   of   real   GDP   will continue  despite  the  international  economic  slowdown. The   main   driver   of   this   growth   will   be   domestic demand  and  in  particular  investment  spending,  which will  be  sustained  by  the  preparations  for  the  Olympics and    the    flows    from    EU    funds.    The    expected improvement   in   the   international   environment   from 2004   and   low   interest   rates   may   help   in   keeping domestic activity buoyant in the period after the end of the  Olympics.  Moreover,  the  Greek  economy  is  very likely   to   benefit   in   the   longer   run   from   the   still unrealised    growth    potential    of    its    neighbouring countries  two  of  which  are  scheduled  to  access  EU  in 2007.     However,     the     forecasts     are     subject     to considerable risks due to international uncertainties.  In 2003, real GDP is expected to rise albeit at a slower pace  reaching  3.6%  and  remaining  above  potential. Investment  spending  will  be  the  main  driver  of  GDP growth  whereas  private  consumption  is  projected  to further decelerate in 2003 and pick up in the last year of the forecast period. Real GDP growth will  accelerate to 3.8%  in  line  with  the  expected  external  recovery  in 2004.  Domestic and international uncertainties combined with the  persisting  inflationary  pressures  will  slow  down private consumption despite the beneficial effect of the 2002 tax reform on disposable income. Notwithstanding the  possible  negative  effect  of  pervasive  uncertainties on  business  investment  plans,  the  acceleration  of  the preparations  for  the  Olympic  Games  and  increased flows from EU Structural Funds will continue boosting investment  spending  on  non  residential  construction. The external transactions deficit is expected to decrease slightly  as  imports  of  goods  and  services  will  rise moderately    whereas    the    gradual    elimination    of international  tensions  might  boost  tourist  flows  in  the second  half  of  2003.  However,  the  external  sector deficit, reflecting domestic macroeconomic imbalances, will  continue  to  be  large  throughout  the  forecasting period.   The   sizeable   and   chronic   external   sector imbalances  point  to  the  weakening  competitiveness  of the  economy  which  is  intensified  by  the  persistent inflation differential in comparison with the euro area .  Costs and prices Consumer price inflation is expected to remain high and well  above  the  EU  and  euro  area  average,  standing  at 3.7% in 2003 and declining to 3.5% in 2004. According to     underlying     assumptions     for     world     primary commodity  prices,  oil  prices  and  the  exchange  rate  of the   euro,   the   contribution   of   imported   inflation   to consumer price inflation should be rather negative Furthermore,  wage  costs  in  the  private  sector  should increase   moderately   following   the   wage   agreement signed in early 2002. Thus, minimum nominal wages in the  private  sector  will  increase  4.2%  in  2003  while compensation  per  employee  for  the  whole  economy  is estimated  to  rise  5.5%.  Unit  labour  costs  in  the  whole economy  are  expected  to  decelerate  at  a  rather  slow pace  due  mainly  to  pressures  stemming  from  the  non- manufacturing  sector.  In  fact,  price  developments  by sector  in  2001  and  2002  point  clearly  to  the  non- tradable  sector  as  the  predominant  source  of  persisting price pressures.  Public finances Government  accounts  have  been  revised  in  2002  after an  agreement  with  the  Commission  (Eurostat)  which resulted  in  the  reclassification  and  correction  in  the treatment  of  a  number  of  operations.  These  revisions turned  the  previously  estimated  general  government surpluses  for  2000  and  2001  into  deficits,  altering  thus considerably  the  budgetary  targets  set  by  the  2002 stability   programme.   Against   this   background   the general  government  deficit  is  estimated  to  have  been equal to 1.2% of GDP in 2002 compared to a previously reported  surplus  of  0.8%  of  GDP.  In  2003,  the  general government  deficit  is  projected  to  decline  to  0.9%  of GDP and  stand at 0.4% of GDP in 2004.   The   revision   of   budgetary   data   similarly   affected developments    in    the    debt    ratio  which in  2002 is  estimated  to  have  been  equal  to  104.9%  of  GDP, instead of  97.3% of GDP reported in the 2001 stability programme. The debt ratio is projected to fall to 96.1% of GDP at the end of 2004.  The  budgetary  strategy  adopted  by  the  2002  stability programme is based on the assumption of a progressive decline    in    debt    servicing    costs    combined    with increasing  primary  surpluses.  Thus,  as  a  result  of  the deceleration in government spending anticipated by the stability  programme,  primary  surplus  is  estimated  to stand  at  4.4%  of  GDP  in  2002  and  4.6%  of  GDP  in 2004.  The  budgetary  adjustment  path  implied  by  the  stability programme   rests   heavily   on   the   assumption   of   a significant   improvement   in   the   central   government balances which is expected to result from holding back primary spending. However, the deeper-seated spending pressures and the lack of the decisive measures required to  tackle  in  particular  the  problem  of  some  inelastic categories   of   government   expenditures,   render   the achievement of the adopted targets uncertain. Thus,  the  general  government  deficit  is  estimated  to stand at 1.1% of GDP in 2003 and fall to 1% of GDP in 2004  with  the  primary  surplus  declining  from  4.1%  of GDP in 2003 to 3.9% of GDP in 2004. The debt ratio is projected   to   stand   at   101%   of   GDP   in   2003   and decrease to 97% of GDP in 2004. 		
April/2003	Spain	Economy to recover strength in 2004	Following 2.7% growth in 2001, weaker final domestic demand  in  2002  led  to  GDP  decelerating  significantly to 2.0% for the whole year, broadly as envisaged in the autumn   forecast.   Weaker   private   consumption   and investment  were  the  main  elements  of  the  slowdown. Given    current    uncertainties,    growth    for    2003    is expected to remain flat at 2.0%, although rising towards the end of the year and achieving in 2004 3.0%, around that  of  estimated  potential.  The  output  gap,  relative  to trend, should be at around zero at the end of the forecast period. Activity in 2002 Despite the slowdown in 2002, mainly driven by private consumption  and  investment,  the  still  relatively  strong domestic  demand  led  GDP  to  record  sounder  rates compared  to  the  main  EU  economies.  The  relatively good  employment  behaviour  contributed  significantly to support private consumption, whereas low growth of gross fixed capital formation can mostly be attributed to negative   investment   in   equipment   due   to   worsened business  expectations.  As  a  result,  imports  decelerated further   in   the   year,   offsetting   to   some   extent   the weakening of exports that mirrored the downward trend observed  in  world  demand.  All  in  all,  the  external contribution to GDP growth was slightly negative. Outlook for  2003 and prospects for 2004 In   2003   private   consumption   is   expected   to   gain momentum,   mainly   due   to   implementation   of   the personal income tax reform and continuing employment creation.  On  the  other  hand,  the  positive  effects  on disposable   income   stemming   from   reform   of   the personal income tax are expected to lead to a significant rise  in  the  household  saving  rate.  These  trends  are foreseen to continue in 2004, with private consumption growing  by  around  3%  from  some  2%  in  2003.  After having   weakened   sharply   in   2002,   investment   is expected  to  gain  strength  in  2003,  stemming  mainly from   higher   equipment   investment   as   a   result   of improved  business  prospects.  On  the  other  hand,  given the strength of construction in recent years and the brisk increase   in   housing   prices,   a   moderation   of   this component  is  expected,  although  it  will  offset  only partially  the  improvement  in  equipment.  All  in  all, gross    fixed    capital    formation    should    accelerate modestly  in  2003.  This  trend  should  consolidate  in 2004, with  equipment investment gaining momentum. Exports  and,  reflecting  a  slowdown  in  final  demand, imports  are  expected  to  fall  sharply  in  the  first  half  of 2003, although recovering later in the year. On balance, the external contribution to GDP growth is expected to be increasingly negative.  Labour market The  deceleration  of  activity  has  slowed  employment creation.  Employment  growth  of  1%  is  expected  in 2003  but  with  this  foreseen  to  recover  above  1½%  by the  end  of  the  forecast  period.  Despite  less  buoyant employment  growth,  the  increase  in  unemployment  in 2003 is expected to be limited and short-lived, with the average  rate  for  the  year  slightly  above  11½%,  around 0.2  percentage  points  above  that  of  2002,  and  falling below  11½%  (Eurostat  definition)  by  the  end  of  2004. The  activity  rate  is  expected  to  rise  by  two  percentage points over the period. Costs and prices Despite the relatively moderate behaviour of unit labour costs,  price  developments  in  2002  were  worse  than expected,  with  the  HICP  inflation  rate  averaging  3.6%, while  core  HICP  inflation  averaged  3.9%.  The  effects of indirect tax increases at the beginning of the year and the  euro  changeover  effect  contributed  to  this  negative result.  Core  inflation  was  high  in  the  first  months  of 2002 although declined thereafter, while an acceleration of prices of unprocessed food and energy in the second half of the year maintained pressure on overall inflation. With  wages  per  head  growing  by  4%  and  positive productivity growth, unit labour costs increased by just over  3%,  below  the  rise  in  the  GDP  deflator  and maintaining the trend observed in recent years.  For  2003  HICP  inflation  is  expected  again  to  exceed 3%,  easing  further  to  slightly  above  2½%  in  2004, provided   wage   moderation   continues.   The   lack   of special  factors  such  as  those  in  2002  should  provide some  relief  to  price  developments.  Consequently,  core inflation  is  also  expected  to  decelerate  in  2003  and 2004.  On  the  side  of  labour  costs,  the  increase  in employee   compensation   per   full-time   equivalent   in 2003  is  expected  to  remain  broadly  stable  despite  a weaker   labour   market   than   in   2002.   However,   the growth  in  unit  labour  costs  is  expected  to  fall,  due  to rising  labour  productivity,  yielding  a  further  decline  in real terms. These trends are expected to extend into  2004, with compensation per employee and unit labour costs moderating further. External sector  The  current  account  deficit  fell  to  2.7%  of  GDP  in 2002;   growth   of   merchandise   trade   slumped.   A recovery  of  exports  of  goods  seems  to  have  started  in the   second   half   of   2002   as   a   result   of   somewhat stronger  world  demand,  coupled  with  a  recovery  of imports. This upward trend is expected to reverse in the first   two   quarters   of   2003   but   to   recover   briskly thereafter   for   both   exports   and   imports,   provided current  uncertainties  are  removed.  The  current  account deficit  is  foreseen  to  remain  broadly  unchanged  at around 2½% of GDP as a result of gains in the terms of trade in both 2003 and 2004 Public finances  In  2002,  despite  the  economic  slowdown,  the  relative buoyancy    of    tax    revenues,    particularly    corporate income    tax,    and    control    of    public    consumption contributed    to    alleviate    pressure    on    the    budget. Consequently,  the  general  government  recorded  only  a slight deficit of 0.1% of GDP.  In   2003   reform   of   personal   income   tax,   including broadly-based  cuts,  is  expected  to  moderate  revenues. The  forecast  of  a  less  optimistic  framework  than  that envisaged  by  the  authorities  in  the budget  leads to a  general    government    deficit    of    0.4%    of    GDP. Nevertheless,  given  the  recent  implementation  of  the General  Law  of  Budgetary  Stability  and  transfer  of major  spending  powers  to  regional  governments,  this forecast  is  necessarily  subject  to  a  high  degree  of uncertainty.  Assuming  no  policy  changes,  the  budget  is  forecast  to record  a  marginal  deficit  in  2004,  broadly  in  line  with Spain’s  stability  programme.  The  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is expected to remain below 60% and on a declining path throughout  the  forecast  period,  being  close  to  50%  in 2004. 		
April/2003	France	Low growth and deteriorating public finances for a second consecutive year in 2003	The economy in the second half of 2002 Real  GDP  growth  decelerated  in  the  second  half  of 2002 to an annualised pace of 1%, down from 2¼% in the  first  half.  This  slowdown  is  mainly  due  to  the deterioration   in   the   external   environment:   a   sharp slowdown  in  the  export  market  growth  of  the  French economy  was  observed  from  autumn  2002,  and  the uncertainties  surrounding  the  global  economy  weighed on  industrialists’  confidence.  Business  confidence  was also  affected  by  the  emergence  of  some  liquidity  and profitability difficulties. In this context, the rapid fall in the  stock-to-GDP  ratio  continued  and  total  investment declined  by  ¾  percentage  point  per  quarter  in  the second half.  The   slowdown   in   economic   activity   in   2002   was attenuated  by  a  strong  increase  in  public  consumption, which contributed well over half of the increase in real GDP,  at  the  expense  of  an  increase  in  the  general government   deficit.   Although   decelerating,   private consumption  brought  the  second  main  contribution  to real GDP growth. In this context, employment creation continued   to   abate   and   the   unemployment   rate   to increase. Current situation and prospects  Several  elements  currently  point  to  a  relatively  weak economic activity over the next few quarters. Since last summer,   business   surveys   have   shown   confidence remaining  low  both  in  manufacturing,  where  output expectations  are  today  below  their  long-term  average, and in the service sector, where indicators are hovering around  their  long-term  average.  These  developments, coupled  with  the  current  low  level  of  margins,  suggest that demand from firms will remain subdued. In  the  second  half  of  2003,  a  recovery  in  the  world economy  together  with  a  gradual  decline  in  oil  prices and   relatively   favourable   monetary   conditions   will contribute to the improvement in demand prospects and are   expected   to   trigger   a   gradual   acceleration   in economic  activity  from  the  end  of  2003.  Real  GDP growth would then resume to a rate close to potential in 2004. GDP components The  acceleration  in  export  volumes  from  autumn  2003 should  support  an  upturn  in  demand  expectations,  and create  the  conditions  for  firms  to  slow  de-stocking. After  two  years  of  decline,  productive  investment  is projected  to  recover  gradually  from  the  end  of  2003, when  the  improvement  in  demand  and  profitability prospects are confirmed and capacity utilisation rises. The  materialisation  of  a  firm  and  durable  recovery  in private  consumption  should  also  be  relatively  gradual and   not   occur   before   the   end   of   2003.   Indeed, households’  real  gross  disposable  income  is  currently decelerating   due   to   the   slowdown   in   employment growth,  to  the  temporary  impact  of  the  increase  in  oil prices, and to lower tax cuts. Moreover, the increase in the   unemployment   rate   and   the   general   climate   of uncertainty,  reflected  in  the  evolution  of  consumers’ confidence,  suggest  that  the  increase  in  the  saving  rate observed in the last few years will not be reversed until 2004.  Labour market, costs and prices . The  deterioration  in  economic  conditions  is  impacting the  labour  market:  employment  growth  was  almost  nil in  the  second  part  of  2002,  and  is  not  expected  to accelerate before the beginning of 2004, when it should remain relatively modest. This projection of a relatively pronounced productivity cycle reflects the necessity for companies    to    restore    margins    after    the    strong contraction of the last two years, and the gradual fading of  the  effects  of  active  labour  market  policies.  In  this context,  the  unemployment  rate  should  decline  only marginally in 2004.  Wage  moderation  is  expected  to  continue  in  2003  and 2004,  even  if  a  slight  acceleration  by  the  end  of  the forecast period cannot be excluded. In 2003, the effects of  the  harmonisation  of  the  different  levels  of  the minimum  wage  created  by  the  working  time  reduction laws will be counterbalanced by a cyclical deceleration in  wages.  In  a  context  of  accelerating  apparent  labour productivity, growth in unit labour costs is projected to be  moderate  in  2003  and  2004,  in  particular  when compared to the relatively dynamic increment observed in 2001 and 2002.  As a consequence, underlying inflationary pressures are projected  to  remain  limited.  Price  moderation  will  also result  from  the  appreciation  of  the  euro  and,  after summer  2003,  the  normalisation  of  energy  and  food prices.   Therefore   the   year-on-year   rate   of   inflation should   decrease   gradually   during   2003,   after   the temporary acceleration in the first few months of 2003, which  was  mainly  due  to  the  impact  of  the  sharp increase  in  oil  prices.  Inflation  is  projected  to  remain moderate in 2004. Public finances In  2002,  French  public  finances  deteriorated  markedly. According  to  Eurostat,  the  general  government  deficit reached 3.1% of GDP. This outcome is to be compared with  a  general  government  deficit  of  1.4%  of  GDP planned in autumn 2001 by the French authorities in the Finance  Law  for  2002  and  with  the  commitment  made by  the  new  government  in  July  to  maintain  the  2002   Table 3.6  Main features of country forecast - FRANCE 2001 Annual percentage change bn Euro Curr. prices %  GDP 1981-98 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004  GDP at constant prices 1463.7 100.0 2.0 3.2 3.8 1.8 1.2 1.1 2.3  Private consumption 805.8 55.1 1.7 3.2 2.5 2.6 1.8 1.7 1.9  Public consumption 340.6 23.3 2.4 1.5 2.7 2.5 3.5 2.4 2.4  GFCF 295.6 20.2 1.7 8.3 7.7 2.3 -0.6 -1.2 3.0   of which :     equipment 110.1 7.5 4.4 11.9 11.5 3.6 -1.4 -0.5 4.7  Change in stocks as % of GDP -1.3 -0.1 0.1 0.6 0.9 0.2 -0.5 -0.4 -0.2  Exports (goods and services) 408.6 27.9 5.2 4.3 12.7 0.5 1.5 2.9 5.2  Final demand 1849.3 126.3 2.4 3.9 5.8 1.4 1.1 1.6 3.1  Imports (goods and services) 385.6 26.3 4.3 6.2 14.3 0.1 1.3 3.7 6.2  GNI at constant prices (GDP deflator) 1469.2 100.4 2.0 3.8 3.3 1.6 0.9 1.1 2.3  Contribution to GDP growth : Domestic demand 1.9 3.7 3.5 2.4 1.6 1.2 2.2 Stockbuilding 0.0 -0.1 0.4 -0.8 -0.6 0.0 0.3 Foreign balance 0.2 -0.3 -0.1 0.1 0.1 -0.1 -0.2  Employment 0.0 1.7 2.2 2.0 0.6 0.1 0.5  Unemployment (a) 9.9 10.7 9.3 8.5 8.7 9.2 9.1  Compensation of employees/head 5.2 2.5 2.1 2.6 2.9 2.6 2.6  Unit labour costs 3.2 1.0 0.6 2.8 2.3 1.5 0.8  Real unit labour costs -0.9 0.4 -0.1 1.3 0.5 -0.1 -0.6  Savings rate of households (b) - 15.3 15.4 15.9 17.1 17.0 17.0  GDP deflator 4.1 0.5 0.7 1.4 1.7 1.6 1.4  Private consumption deflator 4.4 0.4 1.5 1.6 1.5 1.5 1.4  Harmonised index of consumer prices - 0.6 1.8 1.8 1.9 1.9 1.5  Trade balance (c) -0.9 0.9 -0.3 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0  Balance on current transactions with ROW (c) -0.9 2.6 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.1 1.0  Net lending(+) or borrowing(-) vis à vis ROW (c) -1.0 2.5 1.2 1.2 1.0 1.0 0.9  General government balance (c)(d) -3.0 -1.8 -1.4 -1.5 -3.1 -3.7 -3.5  General government gross debt (c) 38.9 58.5 57.2 56.8 59.1 61.8 63.1  (a) as % of civilian labour force.

The larger   part   of   the   slippage   in   the   2002   general government  deficit  represents  a  deterioration  in  the cyclically-adjusted budgetary position.  Under   current   policies,   French   public   finances   are expected  to  deteriorate  further  in  2003.  The  general government  deficit  is  projected  by  the  Commission  to reach  3.7%  of  GDP.  Indeed,  the  budget  for  2003  does not  contain  measures  sizeably  reducing  the  cyclically- adjusted deficit and unfavourable cyclical developments will  continue  weighing  on  fiscal  revenues.  The  general government debt is projected to increase from 59.1% of GDP  to  61.8%  of  GDP,  also  due  to  the  impact  of  the subscription   by   the   State   to   the   recapitalisation   of France  Telecom  worth  0.6  percentage  point  of  GDP. This  is  the  only  financial  transaction  impacting  on  the debt ratio in this forecast. The  forecast  for  2003  is  based  on  the  assumption  that general government  expenditures in real terms are kept broadly  in  line  with  plans,  apart  from  those  influenced by the economic cycle, namely unemployment benefits, and apart from a further slippage in the health sector.   In 2004, despite the acceleration in economic activity to a close-to-potential rate, the general government deficit is  projected  to  decrease  only  marginally  to  3.5%  of GDP.  The  decline  in  the  deficit  will  be  burdened  next year by the lagged impact on fiscal revenues of the low 2003 GDP growth. Given that no budget has been voted for  2004,  a  crucial  assumption  of  this  forecast  is  that real  government  expenditures  are  projected  to  increase by 1.9% in real terms, to be compared with a projection of  1.4%  embodied  in  the  last  update  of  the  stability programme.  The  projected  increase  in  expenditures  is lower than that observed since the inception of stability programmes,  in  order  to  take  into  account  the  positive structural  effects  of  the  measures  taken  in  2002  on health expenditures and on unemployment benefits. 		
April/2003	Ireland	Gradual recovery expected to potential growth	Domestic  demand  was  subdued  in  2002  and,  while private consumption is forecast to recover somewhat, a further moderation is expected to occur in 2003 in view of  limited  public  consumption  and  negative  investment growth.  The  contribution  to  growth  from  net  exports was   very   strong   in   2002,   owing   mainly   to   weak imports,  and  is  forecast  to  remain  positive  but  less pronounced  in  2003.  As  a  result,  real  GDP  growth  is forecast  to  fall  from  around  6%  in  2002  to  3.3%  in 2003.   For   2004,   the   strengthening   world   economy should deliver a further pick-up in Irish activity, leading to GDP growth of 4.5%. The forecast in GNI terms sees a gradual recovery from a trough in 2002. Activity in 2002 Real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  have  averaged  some 6%  in  2002,  in  line  with  preliminary  national  accounts for  the  first  three  quarters  and  similar  to  2001,  when growth  reached  5.7%.  With  the  exception  of  public consumption, domestic demand was weak in 2002. The strong  economic  performance  thus  mainly  stemmed from  a  very  high  contribution  of  net  exports,  which itself  was  due  more  to  weak  imports  than  to  buoyant exports, although exports of chemicals and of computer services  both  grew  strongly.  The  fall-off  in  imports reflected  the  weakness  of  domestic  demand  and  very subdued  imports  of  trade-related  and  other  business services.  Industry  was  the  strongest  sector  in  2002  but industrial   employment   shrank   because   output   gains were concentrated in the chemicals sector, which is not labour-intensive.  As  the  sector  is  also  largely  foreign- owned,  the  impact  on  Irish  incomes  of  its  production boom   is   likely   to   have   been   limited.   Given   the dominance    of    such    foreign-owned    companies    in Ireland, it is useful also to consider the change in gross national income (GNI). In 2002, an unusually wide gap seems  to  have  arisen  between  GNI  and  GDP  growth  in view  of  strong  growth  in  profit  outflows  and  a  sharp fall-off  in  inflows.  Real  GNI  is  estimated  to  have expanded by some 2%, far weaker than in 2001 (4.5%). The economy in 2003 Domestic  demand  is  forecast  to  slow  further  in  2003. Private  consumption  is  expected  to  recover  somewhat but   to   remain   fairly   soft,   given   more   moderate disposable  income  gains  than  in  the  recent  past,  as growth of employment and earnings per capita eases off and   the   scale   of   direct   tax   relief   is   very   modest. Reflecting    the    announced    cap    on    public    sector employment,  public  consumption  is  expected  to  make only  a  marginal  contribution  to  growth.  Overall  fixed investment  is  forecast  to  shrink,  because  the  projected recovery in investment in equipment (after two years of negative  growth)  should  be  more  than  offset  by  a  drop in    construction    investment.    Growth    in    housing completions   is   assumed   to   taper   off   as   supply constraints  start  to  hit  and  demand  eases  due  partly  to an  assumed  slowing  in  net  immigration  and  public investment  was  cut  by  1%  in  nominal  terms  in  the budget.   The  contribution  of  the  external  side  to  growth  is forecast    to    be    less    pronounced    than    in    2002. Merchandise  exports  are  expected  to  stage  a  modest recovery  in  line  with  the  international  upturn.  As  the import    intensity    of    economic    activity    recovers, merchandise  imports  should  also  pick  up  after  two years  of  negative  growth.  Services  credits  are  expected to continue to post strong growth rates, while debits are forecast  to  recover  gradually  from  an  exceptionally weak 2002. Taken  together,  growth  is  forecast  to  accelerate  as  the year  progresses  and  to  average  3.3%  in  GDP  terms. With   net   profit   outflows   expected   to   grow   less dramatically  than  in  2002,  GNI  growth  is  forecast  to improve to just below 3%.  Outlook for 2004 The   strengthening   of   the   international   pick-up   in activity  in  2004  is  expected  to  pave  the  way  for  a further   recovery   driven   by   exports   and   investment. Reflecting improved economic conditions, a modest fall in   the   savings   rate   should   also   support   private consumption.  By  year-end,  growth  should  be  close  to that commonly thought to be sustainable in the medium term, of some 5% in annualised terms, but, for the year as  a  whole,  the  rate  of  expansion,  at  4.5%  in  GDP terms,  will  fall  somewhat  short  of  this  new  rate  of potential growth for the Irish economy. Labour market The   unemployment   rate   has   displayed   a   moderate upward  trend  since  reaching  a  trough  of  3.8%  during the    first    half    of    2001    and    stood    at    4.5%    in January/February  2003.  The  rise  in  2002  was  stemmed by  strong  public  sector  employment  growth;  excluding the   public   sector,   employment   was   flat.   With   the announced  cap  on  public  employment,  continued  weak activity  is  forecast  to  lead  to  employment  growth  well below  labour  force  growth  in  2003,  entailing  a  fairly   Table 3.7  Main features of country forecast - IRELAND 2001 Annual percentage change bn Euro Curr. prices %  GDP 1981-98 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004  GDP at constant prices 114.6 100.0 4.8 11.1 10.0 5.7 6.0 3.3 4.5  Private consumption 53.6 46.8 3.1 9.3 9.0 5.0 2.4 2.8 3.8  Public consumption 16.9 14.8 1.6 6.7 7.6 10.5 8.4 1.7 1.5  GFCF 26.7 23.3 3.5 14.0 7.0 -0.4 -0.1 -0.2 2.7   of which :     equipment 7.8 6.8 4.0 17.3 9.6 -7.4 -3.5 1.5 4.5  Change in stocks as % of GDP 0.3 0.3 0.6 0.5 0.7 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.0  Exports (goods and services) 112.4 98.1 11.0 15.2 20.6 6.7 4.3 4.9 7.5  Final demand 209.9 183.1 6.1 11.8 14.9 5.5 3.6 3.6 5.6  Imports (goods and services) 95.5 83.3 8.5 12.0 21.2 6.1 0.6 3.8 6.8  GNI at constant prices (GDP deflator) 97.8 85.4 4.1 7.5 9.9 4.5 2.0 2.8 3.7  Contribution to GDP growth : Domestic demand 2.7 8.7 7.1 3.9 2.4 1.6 2.5 Stockbuilding 0.2 -1.4 0.3 -0.4 -0.1 -0.1 -0.1 Foreign balance 1.7 4.3 2.4 1.6 4.0 1.8 2.0  Employment 1.4 6.0 4.7 3.0 1.4 0.4 1.4  Unemployment (a) 13.8 5.6 4.3 3.9 4.4 5.6 5.6  Compensation of employees/head 7.0 5.2 8.9 9.2 6.5 5.5 5.2  Unit labour costs 3.5 0.3 3.6 6.4 1.8 2.5 2.1  Real unit labour costs -1.7 -3.7 -0.6 1.1 -3.6 -0.8 -1.5  Savings rate of households (b) - 12.8 11.3 12.0 13.5 13.5 13.3  GDP deflator 5.4 4.1 4.3 5.3 5.6 3.4 3.6  Private consumption deflator 5.2 3.1 4.0 4.2 4.6 4.0 3.1  Harmonised index of consumer prices - 2.5 5.3 4.0 4.7 4.2 3.2  Trade balance (c) 8.3 25.4 27.3 29.9 29.4 28.4 28.5  Balance on current transactions with ROW (c) -1.7 0.4 0.1 -0.3 -0.3 -0.1 0.3  Net lending(+) or borrowing(-) vis à vis ROW (c) - 1.0 1.2 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.5  General government balance (c)(d) -4.9 2.3 4.3 1.1 -0.1 -0.6 -0.9  General government gross debt (c) 96.1 49.3 39.3 36.8 33.3 33.3 33.3  (a) as % of civilian labour force.

Chapter 3 Member States, Ireland 63 sharp  rise  in  unemployment,  to  some  5½%.  In  2004, however,  the  unemployment  rate  should  stabilise.  The forecast assumes moderating net immigration flows and slowing population growth. Costs and prices Growth  in  compensation  per  employee  is  estimated  to have  peaked  in  2001,  at  more  than  9%.  In  (delayed) response  to  weaker  activity  since  early  2001  and  in spite   of   continuing   high   inflation,   wage   inflation appears  to  have  eased  markedly  in  2002.  The  forecast assumes a further gradual moderation to 2004, although earnings   growth   is   expected   to   remain   among   the highest  in  the  euro  area  because  of  a  relatively  tight labour market and high inflation. Like   the   previous   budget,   the   budget   for   2003 introduced  a  range  of  indirect  tax  increases  which  are estimated  to  add  just  under  1  percentage  point  to  the inflation rate. Various increases in user charges are also putting  upward  pressure  on  prices.  This  is  expected  to partly  counteract  the  downward  pressures  stemming from   weak   activity,   easing   earnings   growth   and   a stronger  currency,  so  that  HICP  inflation  is  forecast  to fall from 4.7% in 2002 to 4.2% in 2003. In the absence of  further  significant  indirect  tax  increases,  inflation should ease more markedly in 2004 and the differential with the euro area average should narrow further. External accounts The combined external trade and services balance (as a percentage  of  GDP)  continues  to  rise  over  the forecast period,  although  individual  components  do  not  follow their  respective  trends:  weak  trade  is  estimated  to  stem the  gradual  rise  in  the  trade  balance  (in  2002-2003)  as well  as  the  steady  deterioration  of  the  services  deficit. With   a   widening   income   deficit,   the   balance   of payments  is  forecast  to  record  a  small  deficit  in  2002- 2003  but  in  2004  the  overall  balance  should  be  in  the black  again  thanks  to  the  trade  balance  resuming  its upward trend.  Public finances The  budget  for  2003  implemented  various  revenue- raising measures, while, on the spending side, growth in current  discretionary  expenditure  was  nearly  halved (from 15% in 2002 to 8%) and capital outlays were cut. The deficit is forecast to attain 0.6% of GDP, somewhat better   than   estimated   by   the   authorities   in   March (0.8%).  Given  the  non-indexed  tax  and  social  benefit system,  the  no-policy  change  assumption  for  2004  is made  operational  by  freezing  average  tax  rates  and adjusting  social  transfer  payments  by  the  forecast  CPI inflation rate (with a small top-up). The projections for 2004 take account of the gradual implementation of the “benchmarking”           recommendations           (upward adjustments   to   public   sector   pay   scales   from   a comparison  with  rates  for  similar  jobs  in  the  private sector), as foreseen in the new national agreement, and do  not  include  any  contingency  provisions.  On  these assumptions, the deficit is forecast to widen to 0.9% of GDP,  while  the  debt-to-GDP  ratio  broadly  stabilises  at around 33% over the forecast horizon		
April/2003	Italy	Frailty extends well into 2003 	Real GDP is projected to increase by only 1% in 2003, half of  which  is  carried  over  from  2002.  An  acceleration, sustained  by  domestic  demand,  is  expected  in  2004  in  the context   of   a   more   general   revival   in   the   external environment.  Echoing  economic  activity,  job  creation  in 2003 is forecast to weaken, halting the downward trend in the  rate  of  unemployment.  Inflation  is  expected  to  ease slowly under the rival influences of high energy prices and rising spare capacity.  Activity in 2002 Following  the  slowdown  in  2001,  real  GDP  remained  flat in the first quarter of 2002 before embarking on a cautious growth  path  in  the  remainder  of  the  year.  In  2002  as  a whole  economic  growth  averaged  0.4%,  on  account  of reviving  final  domestic  demand  and  stock-building.  The recovery  of  domestic  demand  was  particularly  evident  in the second half of 2002 when private consumption surged despite  low  confidence  levels  and  accelerating  inflation. The   increase   in   consumption   was   essentially   due   to durable   goods,   helped   by   a   fiscal   incentive   for   car purchases.  Also  helped  by  a  tax  incentive,  investment expenditure   turned   out   even   more   buoyant,   as   firms brought  foreword  expenditure  plans  to  take  advantage  of the  so-called  “Tremonti”  law,  which  expired  at  the  end  of December. However, stronger final demand failed to boost production  as  a  large  part  went  into  higher  imports.  The contribution to growth of net exports was negative. Economic outlook in 2003 and prospects for 2004  The  short-term  outlook  in  2003  remains  bleak,  with  no signs of a swift revival in sight. Industrial production is not expected   to   pick   up   before   the   second   quarter   and indicators  of  economic  activity  in  the  service  sector,  the sole  driving  force  of  growth  in  2002,  weakened  at  the beginning  of  the  year.  In  spite  of  the  prospect  of  weak expansion  over  the  course  of  2003,  economic  growth  is expected  to  come  close  to  1%  in  the  year  as  a  whole, thanks  to  a  carry-over  effect  of  half  a  decimal  point  from 2002. In 2004, growth is forecast to rise slightly above 2% in  the  context  of  a  general  improvement  of  the  external economic environment. As regards GDP components, 2003 is likely to start with a marked   weakening   of   final   domestic   demand.   Private consumption  is  forecast  to  recoil  following  the  sharp  hike in  the  final  months  of  2002.  Moreover,  the  expansionary effect   of   the   income   tax   cut   in   the   2003   budget   is diminished  by  payments  related  to  the  budget’s  broad series  of  tax  amnesties  and  settlements.  The  bringing forward  of  investment  plans  in  the  second  half  of  2002 coupled  with  the  bleak  economic  outlook  is  also  set  to trigger a negative reaction of investment expenditure, also corroborated  by  a  further  decline  in  the  level  of  capacity utilisation  at  the  end  of  2002.  Investment  is  expected  to pick up again in the second half of 2003. The external side will  continue  to  weigh  on  economic  growth,  partially offsetting the expansion of domestic demand. The negative contribution   from   net   exports   is   due   to   the   strong appreciation  of  the  euro  amplified  by  the  price  sensitivity of   labour-intensive   Italian   exports.   In   2004   domestic demand is projected to strengthen on account of recovering confidence   along   with   some   improvement   in   export growth  in  the  context  of  a  general  recovery  in  the  global economic environment. Labour market Although slowing over the course of the year employment creation  continued  in  2002.  The  number  of  jobs  rose  by 1.1%  compared  with  0.3%  in  the  euro  area  as  a  whole, confirming    the    resilience    observed    in    recent    years following  the  successive  steps  of  labour  marker  reform started  in  1998.  The  rate  of  unemployment  averaged  9%, down from 9.4% in 2001. However,  the  sluggish  pace  of  economic  growth  is  likely to   leave   its   mark   on   the   labour   market   in   2003   as employment  expectations  of    manufacturing  and  service firms eased towards the end of 2002. The number of full- time  equivalents  is  predicted  to  increase  by  only  0.4%  in 2003  as  a  whole,  before  growing  stronger  again  in  2004. The  employment  headcount,  as  measured  by  the  labour force survey, will be slightly more buoyant due to recourse to part-time contracts. Moreover, new legislation passed in 2002  aimed  at  legalising  illegal  immigrants  attracted  an unexpectedly  high  number  of  applications,  amounting  to  around  3%  of  employment.  To  the  extent  that  applicants are  accepted  statistics  for  resident  population  and  the labour   force   will   increase.   The   effect   on   measured employment  is  likely  to  be  spread  across  several  years,  as the  processing  of  the  applications  is  reported  to  be  slow. With  some  lag  compared  to  economic  growth,  the  rate  of unemployment  is  forecast  to  creep  up  over  the  course  of 2003,  averaging  9.1%  in  the  year  as  a  whole,  marginally up from 2002, and to resume the downward trend in 2004. Costs and prices In 2002, despite significant demand slack and government action in late August aimed at freezing controlled prices of public  services  for  the  remainder  of  the  year,  inflationary pressure  failed  to  ease,  actually  rising  towards  the  end  of the  year.  The  annual  average  increase  in  the  HICP  was 2.6%, 0.4pp higher than in the euro area as a whole.  After  accelerating  to  3.0%  in  December  2002,  annual HICP  inflation  started  to  ease  at  the  beginning  of  2003, helped by a favourable comparison with the months of the euro   changeover   one   year   earlier.   However,   while   a widening negative output gap, the stronger euro and rising labour  productivity  will  lower  inflationary  pressure  in  the remainder  of  2003,  the  high  starting  point  and  higher  oil prices are likely to keep HICP inflation well above 2% on average. Despite worsened industrial relations the renewal of important wage contracts in 2003 is assumed to remain in line with the track record of wage moderation observed since  the  early  1990s.  Inflation  is  forecast  to  stay  on  a declining  path  up  until  early  2004  as  the  output  gap remains negative and oil prices return to OPEC’s preferred   Table 3.8  Main features of country forecast - ITALY 2001 Annual percentage change bn Euro Curr. prices %  GDP 1981-98 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004  GDP at constant prices 1220.1 100.0 1.9 1.7 3.1 1.8 0.4 1.0 2.1  Private consumption 732.7 60.0 2.2 2.6 2.7 1.0 0.4 1.8 2.2  Public consumption 229.7 18.8 1.6 1.3 1.6 3.6 1.7 1.8 0.8  GFCF 241.3 19.8 1.2 5.0 7.1 2.6 0.5 1.7 3.1   of which :     equipment 116.9 9.6 2.3 7.1 8.7 2.3 0.2 1.6 4.4  Change in stocks as % of GDP -1.2 -0.1 0.7 1.1 0.0 0.0 0.4 0.1 0.1  Exports (goods and services) 346.0 28.4 5.1 0.1 11.7 1.1 -1.0 2.8 6.0  Final demand 1548.3 126.9 2.4 2.5 4.4 1.6 0.6 1.8 3.0  Imports (goods and services) 328.2 26.9 4.9 5.6 8.9 1.0 1.5 4.6 6.1  GNI at constant prices (GDP deflator) 1211.4 99.3 1.8 2.0 3.0 1.9 0.1 0.9 1.9  Contribution to GDP growth : Domestic demand 1.8 2.8 3.4 1.8 0.7 1.7 2.1 Stockbuilding -0.1 0.3 -1.1 0.0 0.4 -0.2 0.0 Foreign balance 0.1 -1.4 0.9 0.1 -0.7 -0.5 0.0  Employment 0.2 0.6 1.7 1.7 1.1 0.4 1.0  Unemployment (a) 9.5 11.3 10.4 9.4 9.0 9.1 8.8  Compensation of employees/head 8.4 2.6 3.1 3.0 2.4 3.3 3.1  Unit labour costs 6.6 1.5 1.7 2.9 3.1 2.6 2.1  Real unit labour costs -1.1 -0.1 -0.4 0.2 0.4 0.2 -0.2  Savings rate of households (b) - 15.6 14.4 15.5 16.3 16.4 16.2  GDP deflator 7.8 1.6 2.1 2.7 2.7 2.5 2.3  Private consumption deflator 7.6 2.1 2.9 2.7 3.0 2.4 2.1  Harmonised index of consumer prices - 1.7 2.6 2.3 2.6 2.4 1.9  Trade balance (c) 0.8 2.4 1.3 1.8 1.9 1.7 2.1  Balance on current transactions with ROW (c) -0.1 1.0 -0.2 0.3 -0.3 -0.6 -0.5  Net lending(+) or borrowing(-) vis à vis ROW (c) 0.0 1.2 0.1 0.4 -0.2 -0.6 -0.4  General government balance (c)(d) -9.5 -1.7 -0.6 -2.6 -2.3 -2.3 -3.1  General government gross debt (c) 97.0 114.9 110.6 109.5 106.7 106.0 104.7  (a) as % of civilian labour force.

Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003 Italy 66 price band of $22-28. In 2004 HICP inflation is forecast to average below 2%.  Public finances After a deficit of 2.6% of GDP in 2001, in 2002 the deficit was  2.3%  (EDP  definition).  The  primary  surplus  declined from  3.8%  to  3.4%  of  GDP.  The  budgetary  outcome benefited   from   one-off   measures   which   improved   the general  government  balance  by  one  percentage  point  of GDP (0.9% sales of publicly-owned real estate and 0.1% a tax amnesty on assets held abroad). Thanks to significantly lower    interest    rates,    interest    expenditure    was    0.7 percentage  points  of  GDP  lower  than  the  previous  year. Legislation  enforced  in  the  second  half  of  the  year  also positively  contributed  to  the  2002  budgetary  result.  The government debt ratio fell to 106.7% of GDP from 109.5% in  2001,  thanks  also  to  a  conversion  operation  carried  out at the end of the year, which reduced the face value of the debt by 1.9% of GDP. In  2003,  the  general  government  deficit  is  forecast  to stabilise  at  the  same  level  as  the  previous  year,  again  on the  back  of  substantial  temporary  measures,  estimated  to have  a  positive  impact  of  1.2%  of  GDP  on  the  budget balance  (0.6%  sales  of  real  estate  and  0.6%  from  various tax   amnesties).   With   interest   rates   at   historically   low levels,  interest  payments  are  expected  to  keep  declining significantly   relative   to   GDP.   The   primary   surplus   is forecast  to  continue  to  deteriorate,  edging  down  to  3%  of GDP. Adjusting for the economic cycle, the budget deficit in 2003 would improve by 0.3 percentage points of GDP; the primary surplus would remain broadly stable.  The  Commission  forecast  is  aligned  with  the  officially estimated  impact  of  a  number  of  measures  introduced  in the  Budget  Law  for  2003.  This  includes  a  series  of  tax settlements   and   amnesties,   all   of   which   have   largely transitory  effects  and  are  subject  to  equal  measures  of upside  and  downside  risks.  However,  in  contrast  with  the official forecast, planned savings in government purchases of  goods  and  services  and  in  subsidies  to  enterprises  are estimated to total 0.6% of GDP. The forecast also assumes increased   social   security   contributions   resulting   from measures   taken   in   2002   to   regularise   the   position   of immigrant workers. The  forecast  for  2004  is  based  on  legislation  currently  in force:  in  the  absence  of  new  policy  measures  the  deficit would   touch   3%   of   GDP.   Tax   and   social   security contributions      receipts      are      consistent      with      the macroeconomic framework and with the estimated effects of  the  measures  in  the  Budget  Law  for  2003.  Other revenues and non-interest expenditures are forecast on the basis   of   the   trends   underlying   the   updated   official projections for 2003-2006 released in September. The rate of   increase   of   compensation   of   employees   has   been adjusted for the assumption that part of the increases from the  new  wage  settlement  will  slide  to  2004.  Gross  fixed capital  formation  reflects  much  lower  sales  of  real  assets. Capital  receipts  reflect  the  expiration  of  one-off  revenue measures.  During  the  forecast  period  the  debt  ratio  is  expected  to continue to decline slowly		
April/2003	Luxembourg	Succession of weaker years after golden decade	The economy in 2002 and 2003 In the 10 years from 1991 to 2000, real GDP growth in Luxembourg   averaged   5.4%,   well   above   the   EU average.  In  2001,  economic  growth  slowed  down  very markedly,  to  1.0%,  in  response  to  the  slowdown  in  the world  economy  and  the  turmoil  on  financial  markets. The  negative  external  shocks  first  affected  exposed sectors such as manufacturing and finance. The adverse impact  of  developments  in  financial  markets  was  more profound   in   Luxembourg   than   in   many   other   EU countries, due to the large size of the financial sector. In 2002  and  2003,  the  slowdown  in  activity  progressively spread to sheltered sectors of the economy, in particular to  labour-intensive  commercial  services  that  are  highly dependent  on  the  financial  sector.  Overall  real  GDP growth is estimated to have been around 0.4% in 2002. This is somewhat higher than forecast in the autumn of last  year  mainly  due  to  a  steeper  than  expected  fall  in imports and to some signs of a bottoming out of activity in some sectors towards the end of 2002. The first months of 2003 show some tentative signs of a bottoming-out  in  industry.  Banks  appear  to  have  been successful  in  reducing  costs  in  2002,  but  adjustment  in many  other  sectors  should  continue  over  most  of  the forecast  horizon.  That  said,  the  earlier  reduction  of corporate  tax  rates  should  have  a  positive  impact  on economic   activity,   even   though   this   is   difficult   to quantify. Real GDP growth in 2003 is forecast at close to   1%,   but   the   high   exposure   of   the   economy   of developments  in  the  highly  volatile  financial  sector makes  for  a  large  margin  of  uncertainty  surrounding this estimate. As  regards  trends  in  expenditure,  private  consumption growth  is  forecast  to  remain  weak  in  2003,  at  around 1½%, as is evident from weak retail sales into the early months  of  this  year.  Lacklustre  private  consumption growth  reflects  the  slowdown  in  the  labour  market,  the decline  in  consumer  confidence  and  higher  household savings.    The    growth    rate    of    real    government consumption   should   remain   high   over   the   forecast horizon.  Weak  profits,  the  need  to  cut  down  costs  and uncertainty  as  regards  the  near-term  outlook  should continue   to   put   downward   pressure   on   corporate investment,  even  though  the  growth  rate  of  real  public investment should remain high, at around 9%.  Prospects for 2004 In 2004, economic activity is forecast to recover on the back   of   the   expected   pick   up   in   world   demand. However, the pick up in the rate of real GDP growth, to 2.7%,  would  be  relatively  slow  compared  to  previous cyclical   upturns,   as   key   sectors   of   the   economy, including  the  financial  sector,  are  expected  to  recover only gradually. Private non-residential capital formation is expected to recover gradually in the course of 2004 in line  with  the  upturn  in  domestic  and  external  demand, whereas  public  investment  should  remain  strong.  The net  export  contribution  should  rise  in  line  with  the recovery of world trade. Total investment is expected to grow by 3.6%.  Labour market developments The labour market responds to the economic slowdown with a lag. In Luxembourg, cross-border employment is highly  sensitive  to  cyclical  conditions  and  the  sharp deceleration  in  the  inflow  of  cross-border  workers  in the  course  of  2002  illustrates  the  turnaround  in  the labour  market.  Total  employment  growth  is  forecast  to decelerate   to   around   1%   in   both   2003   and   2004. Whereas  consolidation  measures  in  the  manufacturing and banking sectors already led to substantial job losses in  those  sectors  in  2002,  redundancies  are  expected  to spread  to  other  more  shielded  sectors  in  the  course  of 2003 and 2004. This should lead to a rise in the number of  resident  unemployed,  even  though  this  increase  is likely  to  be  cushioned  by  the  specific  measures  for  the unemployed    already    in    place.    Nevertheless,    the unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  increase  appreciably over the forecast horizon, to 3.7% in 2004. Costs and prices HICP   inflation   is   expected   to   decelerate   over   the forecast  horizon  from  2.1%  in  2003  to  1.6%  in  2004. This  reflects  inter  alia  the  pass-through  of  declines  in import  prices,  weak  demand  conditions,  and  the  fading of the upward impact on inflation of the introduction of the  cash  euro.  According  to  a  study  carried  out  jointly by  STATEC  and  the  Banque  Central  du  Luxembourg the  cash  changeover  led  to  a  cumulative  increase  of consumer   prices   of   around   0.7   percentage   point between  January  2001  and  July  2002.  The  cyclical pickup  in  productivity  and  relatively  moderate  wage increases (in response to the weakening labour market) are expected to contribute also to lower price pressures. Public finances The government accounts remained in surplus in 2002: net lending of general government amounted to 2.6% of GDP, compared to 6.4% in 2001. The outcome for 2002 was  more  favourable  than  previously  expected,  largely owing  to  strong  corporate  tax  revenues  reflecting  the lagged response of tax receipts to changes in the growth rate,  to  some  increase  in  the  collection  of  tax  arrears, and  to  lower-than-expected  expenditure  from  special funds.   In   2003   and   2004,   the   general   government balance  is  expected  to  deteriorate  to  a  deficit  of  0.2% and 1.2% of GDP respectively. This reflects the lagged impact  of  the  economic  slowdown  on  tax  revenue  and social  security  contributions,  a  fading  of  the  impact  of collecting  corporate  taxes  still  due  from  years  with   Table 3.9  Main features of country forecast - LUXEMBOURG 2001 Annual percentage change mio Euro Curr. prices %  GDP 1981-98 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004  GDP at constant prices 21510.3 100.0 4.9 6.0 8.9 1.0 0.4 1.1 2.7  Private consumption 9104.2 42.3 3.2 2.6 3.3 3.6 1.2 1.6 2.7  Public consumption 3719.1 17.3 4.0 7.1 4.3 7.5 5.4 6.4 4.5  GFCF 4667.9 21.7 4.6 14.0 -6.3 5.9 -2.4 0.8 3.6   of which :     equipment 1673.9 7.8 5.6 25.4 -19.6 7.0 -1.8 -1.3 3.6  Change in stocks as % of GDP 179.4 0.8 1.2 0.5 -0.5 0.9 0.4 0.3 0.3  Exports (goods and services) 32792.4 152.4 6.8 12.0 19.1 1.2 -2.4 1.8 3.1  Final demand 50462.9 234.6 5.4 9.6 11.3 3.2 -1.1 2.0 3.2  Imports (goods and services) 28952.6 134.6 5.9 12.9 14.0 4.5 -2.3 2.8 3.5  GNI at constant prices (GDP deflator) 19154.8 89.0 5.1 2.8 1.1 -0.3 -0.3 1.3 2.8  Contribution to GDP growth : Domestic demand 3.4 5.7 0.7 4.0 0.9 2.1 2.9 Stockbuilding 0.3 -0.3 -1.0 1.4 -0.1 0.0 0.0 Foreign balance 1.2 0.5 8.3 -4.0 -0.5 -1.0 -0.2  Employment 2.2 5.0 5.6 5.6 2.8 1.1 1.2  Unemployment (a) 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.0 2.4 3.3 3.7  Compensation of employees/head 4.9 3.4 4.7 4.4 3.0 2.5 2.5  Unit labour costs 2.2 2.4 1.5 9.1 5.5 2.5 0.9  Real unit labour costs -1.4 -0.7 -1.2 6.7 3.7 0.4 -1.1  Savings rate of households (b) - - - -    - - -  GDP deflator 3.6 3.1 2.8 2.3 1.7 2.1 2.0  Private consumption deflator 3.8 1.4 2.6 2.8 2.0 1.9 1.5  Harmonised index of consumer prices - 1.0 3.8 2.4 2.1 2.1 1.6  Trade balance (c) -11.5 -12.9 -9.2 -12.1 -11.5 -11.4 -10.9  Balance on current transactions with ROW (c) - - - - -3.7 -3.8 -3.7  Net lending(+) or borrowing(-) vis à vis ROW (c) - - - - -3.7 -3.8 -3.7  General government balance (c) - 3.5 6.1 6.4 2.6 -0.2 -1.2  General government gross debt (c) 7.1 6.0 5.6 5.6 5.3 4.1 3.4  (a) as % of civilian labour force.

Adverse   developments   in   the   central   government accounts  will  account  for  most  of  the  deterioration  of the  general  government  balance  in  2003  and  2004, while local government revenues should be affected  negatively by the effects of the earlier tax reforms from 2004   onwards.

April/2003	Netherlands	Deterioration of public finances in response to sluggish growth	The situation in 2003  Following a number of years in which real GDP growth exceeded   the   EU   average,   the   Dutch   economy   is experiencing  a  sharp  slowdown.  In  2002  real  GDP growth  was  no  more  than  0.3%,  compared  to  1.3%  in 2001. As elsewhere in the EU, the slowdown in activity was  initially  driven  by  the  deceleration  in  international trade. The deterioration in external competitiveness, the consequent   losses   in   export   market   share   and   the appreciation of the euro contributed to the slowdown in exports. The cyclical downturn worsened in the wake of a    marked    slowdown    in    domestic    demand    and substantial  destocking.  In  2003,  economic  growth  is expected to remain weak, at 0.5%. Private consumption growth  is  forecast  to  remain  modest,  growing  by  less than  1%,  reflecting  significant  declines  in  consumer confidence,    a    fall    in    employment    and    rising unemployment,   and   the   downward   impact   of   tax increases    on    household    real    disposable    income. Household  income  will  also  be  affected  negatively  by substantial  increases  in  pension  premiums,  as  many pension  funds  faced  a  fall  of  reserves  below  required minimum  levels  due  to  the  decline  in  equity  prices.  In addition,   the   slump   on   equity   markets   and   the moderation on the housing market are expected to lead to  an  end  to  the  wealth  effects  that  boosted  private consumption between the mid-1990s and the year 2000. Due  to  restraints  on  government  spending  in  the  2003 budget,     the     growth     rate     of     real     government consumption    would    decrease    markedly    to    0.0%, compared  to  close  to  4%  in  2002.  Weak  profits,  low business confidence and uncertainty as regards the near- term outlook would continue to put downward pressure on    corporate    investment,    even    though    housing investment  is  expected  to  accelerate.  The  contribution of  inventories  to  real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  turn slightly  positive  in  2003,  following  the  drag  on  growth put in 2002 during the downward phase of the inventory cycle.  The situation in the labour market is expected to worsen progressively, responding to the cyclical downturn with a lag.  Hesitant recovery in 2004 A  rebound  in  domestic  demand  and  some  pick  up  in export  growth  would  lead  to  a  modest  upturn,  already starting  in  the  course  of  2003  onwards.  Real  GDP growth  is  expected  to  reach  1.7%  in  2004.  Private consumption   growth   is   expected   to   increase   only modestly to 1.5%, despite a drop in inflation, due to the fading  of  negative  wealth  effects,  the  worsening  labour market,  and  further  increases  in  pension  premiums. Private  non-residential  capital  formation  is  expected  to recover  gradually  in  the  course  of  2004  and  grow  by around  2%,  in  line  with  the  modest  upturn  in  domestic and  external  demand.  On  the  external  side,  export growth  is  expected  to  increase  to  5.1%  in  2004  in response  to  projected  developments  in  world  demand. However,   the   recovery   of   net   exports   would   be relatively    muted    compared    to    previous    cyclical upswings, as losses in competitiveness not only dampen the  recovery  of  exports,  but  also  lead  to  a  gradual increase in import penetration.  Employment and unemployment Total  employment  is  forecast  to  decrease  by  0.4%  in 2003  and  to  stagnate  in  2004.  This  reflects  the  lagged response   of   the   labour   market   to   the   economic slowdown. The turnaround in the labour market lead to a significant increase in the unemployment rate over the forecast  horizon,  by  around  2.5  percentage  point  to 5.1%  in  2004.  The  lag  with  which  employment  growth responds  to  the  slowdown  in  activity  should  be  longer than usual, due to ‘labour hoarding’ in a labour market, which   has   been   very   tight   in   recent   years.   It   is envisaged  that  labour  supply  will  grow  at  lower  rates than  witnessed  in  the  second  half  of  the  1990s,  partly because   of   demographic   factors.   Consequently,   the unemployment rate should continue to increase in 2004, in spite of the expected cyclical recovery. Costs and prices HICP  inflation  is  expected  to  decrease  markedly  over the  forecast  horizon,  from  3.9%  in  2002  to  2.7%  in 2003 and 1.5% in 2004. This is due to a combination of factors,  including  the  impact  of  lower  import  prices, and  a  substantial  easing  of  unit  labour  costs.  The  latter reflects more moderate wage developments in response to weak growth and rising unemployment, along with a cyclical  recovery  in  labour  productivity  growth.  That said,  increases  in  pension  premiums  are  expected  to offset  part  of  the  beneficial  effect  of  easing  wage increases  on  labour  costs.  Base  effects  associated  with the cash changeover to the euro, the liberalisation of the gas  market  for  consumers,  an  intended  decrease  in petrol  taxes,  and  the  fading  of  some  other  special factors  that  put  upward  pressure  on  prices  in  2002  will also contribute to the deceleration of inflation. Public finances The  fiscal  accounts  deteriorated  substantially  in  2002 , after having reached a surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 2001. In  2002,  provisional  data  show  a  general  government deficit  of  1.1%  of  GDP.  The  deterioration  of  public finances  mainly  reflects  the  operation  of  automatic stabilisers  in  a  weak  economic  environment,  as  well  as the  lagged  impact  of  tax  reforms  and  some  revenue shortfalls  related  to  increases  in  pension  premiums. Significant tax increases and expenditure cuts are being introduced   in   2003 .

Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003 The Netherlands 72 income  tax  deductible  items  and  fast  increasing  health care  contributions.  On  the  other  hand,  tax  receipts  are depressed     by     substantial     increases     in     pension contributions.  Expenditure  reductions  stem,  inter  alia, from  cuts  in  the  number  of  civil  servants  and  reduced eligibility   for   unemployment   schemes.   The   weak economic environment implies a further deterioration of the general government balance in 2003, to a deficit of 1.6%  of  GDP.    The  fiscal  outlook  for  2004  is  highly uncertain at the time of writing, as negotiations to form a   new   coalition   government   following   the   general elections  of  22  January  2002  are  still  ongoing.  Under the  technical  assumption  of  no  policy  changes,  the general  government  balance  deteriorates  in  2004,  to  a deficit of 2.4% of GDP. Thus, the budgetary position of the Netherlands would have deteriorated in a few years from  a  small  surplus  in  2001  to  a  substantial  deficit. Under  a  no  policy  change  assumption,  the  cyclically adjusted  general  government  balance  also  deteriorates from 2003 to 2004. 1  As a result of projected deficits and low  economic  growth  the  gross  government  debt  ratio will  increase    slightly  in  2004,  to  52.8%  of  GDP.  An incoming    government    will    most    likely    announce consolidation  measures.  Hence,  for  2004  the  current projected deficit could be interpreted as an upper bound to expected deficits		
April/2003	Austria	Slow recovery in investment dampens growth	Developments in 2002 Despite   having   accelerated   slightly,   the   economic performance in 2002 was rather disappointing, because of   a   weakening   in   domestic   components,   due   to sluggish    household    demand    and    a    sharper-than- anticipated  fall  in  investment.  Exports,  by  contrast, although   decelerating   significantly,   developed   more favourably  than  expected  thanks  to  firm  demand  from central  and  eastern  Europe.  Due  to  a  slump  in  imports, the growth contribution of the external sector increased markedly.  Private   consumption   grew   at   a   modest   rate,   with disposable  income  of  households  being  squeezed  by weak  employment  growth,  rising  unemployment  and higher-than-anticipated   inflation.   Investment   took   a dive,   with   equipment   investment   plunging   due   to deteriorating demand expectations, and, possibly, due to having  partly  been  postponed  in  anticipation  of  a  tax incentive  favouring  investment  undertaken  in  the  year 2003.  Construction  continued  to  suffer  from  excess supply  and  budgetary  restraint,  although  benefiting,  to some  extent,  from  the  flood  disaster  hitting  Austria  in August  2002.  Overall,  at  1.0%,  output  growth  in  2002 remained close to the modest expansion of the previous year. Inflation declined in the course of the year, decelerating by  0.6  percentage  points  compared  with  2001  to  1.7% on average. Weak output growth led to a sharp increase in    unemployment,    with    the    jobless    rate    staying nonetheless significantly below the EU15-average.  Prospects The economic recovery is weaker than earlier expected due to the delay in the international upswing. Although accelerating  slightly  in  2003,  GDP  growth  will  resume its  trend  rate  only  in  2004,  thanks  to  strengthening domestic  demand  and  the  expected  rebound  in  exports. Real  GDP  growth  in  2003  is  forecast  to  move  up  to around  1¼%  and  to  improve  further  to  a  rate  of  2%  in 2004.  Demand components Household  real  disposable  income  should  expand  only moderately   in   2003,   owing   to   unfavourable   labour market  conditions,  before  accelerating  in  2004,  thanks to  rising  employment  and  despite  sticky  inflation.  As  a result, private consumption, albeit picking up slightly in 2003,  is  expected  to  rebound  only  in  2004.  Public consumption   is   forecast   to   remain   rather   subdued throughout  the  projection  period,  assuming  that  the government   will   make   efforts   to   control   budgetary spending. After a nose-dive in 2002,  investment should recover, if slowly, in 2003 before gaining momentum in 2004,   reflecting   the   improved   outlook   for   exports. Construction  investment,  in  particular  civil  engineering but  also  housing  construction,  is  projected  to  benefit  to some  extent  from  the  flood  disaster  of  last  summer, with a turnaround of the downward trend expected as of 2003.  Although  recovering,  equipment  investment  is expected to remain subdued in 2003 reflecting both the delay  in  the  economic  upswing  and  sufficient  unused capacity.  Towards  the  end  of  the  year,  however,  firms, considering  the  improved  economic  outlook,  could  try to  take  advantage  of  a  tax  incentive  applicable  in  2003 and  bring  forward  investments.  Although  exports  are expected to gain momentum, they should not come into full swing before 2004. With imports also accelerating, reflecting  the  improvement  in  domestic  demand,  the contribution  of  net  exports  to  GDP  growth  should  turn neutral as of 2003. Prices and wages Consumer  price  inflation  is  likely  to  remain  rather sticky throughout the forecast period in 2003 due to the increase  in  oil  prices  and  despite  decelerating  unit labour costs in 2004 due to an increase in energy taxes.  Nominal increases in contractual wages in 2003 remain below  those  of  the  previous  year.  In  2004,  although wage  moderation  in  the  private  sector  is  expected  to continue, the cyclical upswing should lead to somewhat higher wage settlements. In the public sector, however given  that  the  wage  increase  for  2001-02  was  very moderate  and  entailed  significant  losses  in  real  terms, an    additional    pay-rise    to    partly    compensate    for purchasing power losses, is expected for 2003. Overall, wage growth in 2003 should be below that of 2002 and step up somewhat  in 2004. Labour market In 2002, sl uggish  output  growth  had  an  adverse  impact on  the  labour  market,  with  both  dependent  and  self- employment  declining  noticeably.  With  overall  output growth remaining subdued in 2003 and given the usual time lag of about six months, a more sustained pick-up in labour demand can be expected only in the course of 2004,  when  the  economic  activity  should  have  gained momentum.   Total   employment   growth   in   2003   is expected  to  be  dampened  by  a  continued  fall  in  self- employment  before  strengthening  in  2004.  As  of  2003, labour  supply  is  forecast  to  change  in  line  with  the business    cycle,    contrary    to    the    counter-cyclical expansion  observed  in  the  recent  past.  Reflecting  the projected  tendencies  of  labour  demand  and  supply,  the sharp   rise   in   unemployment   registered   in   2002   is expected   to   decelerate   significantly   in   2003   before slowly turning around in 2004.  Current account In  2002,  export  growth  in  combination  with  a  fall  in imports  yielded  a  trade  surplus,  which  is  a  noteworthy event. Despite a pick-up in domestic demand as of 2003   Table 3.11  Main features of country forecast - AUSTRIA 2001 Annual percentage change bn Euro Curr. prices %  GDP 1981-98 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004  GDP at constant prices 211.9 100.0 2.3 2.7 3.5 0.7 1.0 1.2 2.0  Private consumption 121.6 57.4 2.5 2.3 3.3 1.5 0.9 1.2 1.9  Public consumption 40.5 19.1 1.8 3.1 0.0 -0.5 1.3 0.5 0.5  GFCF 49.1 23.2 2.2 2.1 5.9 -2.2 -4.8 1.6 3.1   of which :     equipment 19.5 9.2 2.4 4.7 11.5 -4.1 -9.2 2.7 5.7  Change in stocks as % of GDP 0.7 0.3 0.3 1.2 0.5 0.0 0.2 0.3 0.4  Exports (goods and services) 111.1 52.5 4.7 8.5 13.4 7.4 2.6 4.3 7.1  Final demand 323.0 152.5 2.9 4.6 6.0 2.3 0.7 2.3 3.9  Imports (goods and services) 111.2 52.5 4.3 9.0 11.6 5.9 0.0 4.5 7.5  GNI at constant prices (GDP deflator) 207.8 98.1 2.3 2.3 3.5 0.3 1.9 1.2 2.0  Contribution to GDP growth : Domestic demand 2.3 2.4 3.2 0.2 -0.3 1.1 1.9 Stockbuilding 0.0 0.5 -0.7 -0.4 0.0 0.0 0.1 Foreign balance 0.1 -0.2 0.8 0.8 1.4 0.0 0.0  Employment 0.1 1.3 0.9 0.5 -0.4 0.0 0.4  Unemployment (a) 3.4 3.9 3.7 3.6 4.3 4.5 4.4  Compensation of employees/head 4.6 2.1 2.5 1.8 2.2 2.3 2.7  Unit labour costs 2.3 0.7 -0.1 1.6 0.7 1.1 1.1  Real unit labour costs -0.6 0.0 -1.5 0.0 -0.5 0.0 -0.4  Savings rate of households (b) - 12.2 11.4 9.9 9.2 8.6 8.7  GDP deflator 3.0 0.7 1.4 1.6 1.3 1.1 1.5  Private consumption deflator 3.0 0.9 1.5 2.0 1.8 1.8 1.7  Harmonised index of consumer prices - 0.5 2.0 2.3 1.7 1.8 1.8  Trade balance (c) -3.8 -1.6 -1.3 -0.6 1.7 1.5 1.5  Balance on current transactions with ROW (c) -1.0 -3.0 -2.6 -2.2 -0.1 -0.3 -0.6  Net lending(+) or borrowing(-) vis à vis ROW (c) -1.0 -3.1 -2.8 -2.5 -0.1 -0.3 -0.6  General government balance (c)(d) -3.2 -2.3 -1.5 0.3 -0.6 -1.1 -0.4  General government gross debt (c) 56.3 67.5 66.8 67.3 68.7 68.5 66.8  (a) as % of civilian labour force.

Chapter 3 Member States, Austria 75 and  a  projected  acceleration  in  merchandise  imports, the   trade   balance   could   remain   in   surplus,   albeit declining.  As  regards  the  services  balance,  however, preliminary  national  accounts  data  for  2002  appears  to be at odds with current account figures as published by the  central  bank.  Preliminary  national  accounts  figures indicate  that  the  traditional  Austrian  services  surplus turned  into  a  deficit,  which  is  rather  puzzling.  Current account  data  on  an  accruals  basis  up  the  third  quarter plus  the  preliminary  data  on  a  cash  basis  for  the  last three  months,  by  contrast,  suggest  that  the  services balance   in   2002   could   have   remained   in   surplus. Although  the  official  current  account  figures  for  2002 will be published only at the end of April, a revision of the national accounts data would not come as a surprise.   Public finances In  2002,  the  budgetary  position  weakened  by  almost one percentage point of GDP to a deficit of 0.6% after a surplus  of  0.3%  of  GDP  in  2001  (figures  in  EDP definition,  i.e.  including  swap  operations),  although output  growth  accelerated  slightly  to  1.0%  from  0.7% in   2001.   This   result   falls   short   of   the   stability programme target (-0.2% of GDP) set in the low growth scenario  (assuming  real  GDP  growth  at  0.9%).  While, in 2001, a strong rise in tax revenues helped to improve the   cyclically-adjusted   position   despite   low   output growth, the particularly weak domestic demand in 2002 depressed tax revenues. However, a marked increase in “other  revenues”  and  a  lower-than-anticipated  rise  in expenditures  –  partly  due  to  the  flood  disaster,  which, contrary   to   earlier   expectations,   had   virtually   no    budgetary  impact  in  2002  -  entailed  a  more  benign budgetary   outcome   than   projected   by   the   Austrian authorities   and   forecast   by   the   Commission      last autumn.  This  result  was  achieved  despite  a  decline  in the surplus at the Länder level.  In 2003, the continued alleviating effects of the pension reform  2000  and  the  cuts  in  personnel  are  projected  to be  offset  by  additional  labour  market  expenditure,  as foreseen  in  the  fiscal  stimulus  package , topped  by flood-related  spending,  under  the  assumption  that  the emergency  funds  unspent  in  2002  will  be  released  in 2003.  The  tax  intake  should  reflect  the  rather  bleak cyclical  situation,  despite  some  pick-up  in  domestic components.  Public  sector  employees  are  expected  to be  granted  an  additional  pay  rise,  making  up  for  past purchasing  power  losses.  In  summary,  the  expected delay  in  the  cyclical  upswing  and  hence  employment growth   as   well   as   the   continued,   if   small,   rise   in unemployment,  should  cause  the  deficit  in  2003  to widen to around 1% of GDP before narrowing again in 2004.  In  keeping  with  the  Commission’s  no-policy- change  assumption,  the  projection  for  2004  does  not incorporate the tax reform, which is planned but has not yet been decided.  The government finances forecast for 2003 and 2004 is subject  to  great  uncertainty,  since  only  a  few  concrete measures were known at the cut-off date. Due to delays in  the  formation  of  a  government  after  parliamentary elections  held  on  24  November  2002,  the  budget  for 2003,  and  also  2004,  was  in  the  drafting  process  at  the cut-off date and should be adopted around mid-June		
April/2003	Portugal	Further adjustment towards more sustainable levels of domestic demand 	The Portuguese economy The  Portuguese  economy  is  undergoing  a  process  of adjustment. Following a period of strong growth driven by  domestic  demand  (real  economic  growth  averaged 4%  in  the  1995-2000  period),  a  number  of  imbalances have  emerged  in  the  Portuguese  economy,  notably  a significant external deficit in percentage of GDP, a rise in the credit-to-income ratios in the private sector above the   average   level   in   the   euro-area,   and   a   gradual deterioration   in   the   underlying   budgetary   position, which  led  to  the  excessive  deficit  in  2001.  The  strong rise in indebtedness in the private sector of the economy is a new phenomenon, the correction of which is likely to  lengthen  the  period  of  economic  recovery  beyond what     would     be     normally     expected     from     the developments in the external environment.  GDP  growth  decelerated  from  3.7%  in  the  1999-2000 period  to  1.6%  in  2001  and  to  an  estimated  ½%  in 2002. The weakness of economic activity in the second half  of  2002,  in  line  with  the  slowdown  in  the  EU, limits  considerably  the  growth  prospects  for  2003.  The adjustment   in   all   major   components   of   domestic demand  is  projected  to  carry  on  in  2003.  While  in  the 2001-2002 period private consumption was particularly affected  by  the  decline  in  the  demand  for  durable goods,  in  2003  the  demand  for  non-durables  is  also expected  to  falter  as  the  situation  in  the  labour  market deteriorated  rapidly  at  the  end  of  2002.  Investment  in both  construction  and  equipment  is  expected  to  recede for a second consecutive year in 2003, according to the available  quantitative  and  qualitative  indicators.  Public consumption  growth  is  projected  to  slowdown  during the  forecast  period,  following  the  ongoing  budgetary adjustment.  Overall,  domestic  demand  is  forecast  to recede   again   in   2003   by   about   ¼%,   following   a contraction of some ½% in 2002. Consequently, import growth is expected to virtually stagnate in 2003, which together  with  the  re-orientation  of  production  towards foreign    markets    and    a    certain    degree    of    wage moderation  is  forecast  to  stimulate  export  growth,  thus leading to an improvement in the external balance. The contribution  of  net  exports  to  growth  is  expected  to remain  at  about  ¾  pp  of  GDP  in  2003,  becoming  the driving   force   of   economic   activity   throughout   the forecast period. A  moderate  pick-up  is  expected  only  from  the  second half    of    2003    onwards,    reflecting    the    gradual improvement of economic conditions in Europe, which is  expected  to  strengthen  the  export  sector.  For  the whole of 2003, GDP growth is expected at around ½%, partly   due   to   the   negative   carry   over   from   2002, accelerating  to  about  2%  in  2004.  Domestic  demand  is forecast to resume growth only in 2004. This is mainly due  to  continued  efforts  by  private  sector  agents  to redress  their  balance  sheets,  following  the  sharp  rise  in indebtedness  in  recent  years.  The  external  deficit  is therefore  forecast  to  nearly  halve  between  2002  and 2004,  declining  to  a  value  close  to  3¼%  of  GDP  in 2004. GDP components  Private consumption is expected to remain virtually flat in 2003, reflecting the rise in unemployment, the lower wage   increases,   and   the   historically   low   levels   of confidence.   Total   investment   is   forecast   to   decline further  in  2003,  reflecting  adverse  cyclical  conditions, together  with  the  reduction  in  public  investment  not co-financed  by  EU  funds  due  to  budgetary  constraints. Growth  in  total  investment  is  only  expected  to  turn positive  in  2004.  Export  market  growth  is  estimated  to accelerate  sharply  from  1%  in  2002  to  approximately 5½% on average in the 2003-2004 period. The rebound in  foreign  demand  is  expected  to  lead  to  a  rise  in exports   as   market   shares   are   projected   to   remain broadly   unchanged   in   2003-2004   after   the   gains registered  in  2001-2002.  The  total  import  elasticity  of final  demand  is  estimated  to  decline  in  2002-2003, because   of   the   marked   slowdown   in   demand   for durables  which  have  a  high  import  content.  With  the revival  of  investment  and  exports,  the  import  elasticity should  edge  up  again  at  the  end  of  the  forecast  period. Overall,  the  contribution  of  total  net  exports  to  GDP growth is forecast to be between ½% and ¾% per year over the forecast period.  Prices  HICP inflation is forecast to decelerate markedly in the second  half  of  2003,  following  the  rise  in  2002  which was   largely   caused   by   temporary   effects   as   the   2 percentage points rise in the standard VAT rate to 19% as from mid 2002. Moderate import price inflation, low wage    increases,    and    subdued    domestic    demand throughout   the   forecast   period   are   all   expected   to contribute to dampen inflation from about 3.7% in 2002 to a projected 2¼% in 2004.  Labour Market The  labour  market  deteriorated  rapidly  at  the  end  of 2002,  with  the  unemployment  rate  jumping  to  6.2%  in the fourth quarter (2 percentage points more than a year earlier).  This  reflects  basically  a  markedly  deceleration in  employment  creation  from  1.4%  in  2001  to  0.2%  in 2002. This adverse trend is projected to continue during the   forecast   period,   with   the   unemployment   rate expected to exceed 7% in 2004, which is clearly above the  estimated  NAIRU.  The  easing  in  labour  market conditions  combined  with  possible  spill-over  effects from the planned lower pay rises in the public sector are expected  to  bring  about  lower  wage  increases  in  the private  sector  of  the  economy.  The  total  wage  per employee is expected to decelerate from about 5¼% in 2002   to   2¼%   in   2004,   thus   contributing   to   an improvement in price-competitiveness.  Public finances  The   general   government   deficit   in   2002   (the   EDP definition)  attained  2.7%  of  GDP,  down  from  4.2%  in 2001.  The  government  deficit  target  of  2.8%  of  GDP for  2002  was  therefore  met  despite  the  unfavourable starting  point,  and  the  gradual  weakening  of  cyclical conditions   during   the   year.   This   reflects   the   firm commitment of the Portuguese authorities to correct the  excessive  deficit  as  soon  as  possible  with  a  view  to regaining  policy  credibility  and  preserving  the  political momentum   towards   budgetary   consolidation.   That momentum   was   initiated   with   the   approval   of   the rectifying  budget  for  2002,  and  continued  with  the political commitments made in response to the Council recommendation     addressed     to     Portugal     in     the framework of the excessive deficit procedure. However, compliance  with  the  deficit  target  for  2002  was  only made  possible  due  to  the  significant  amount  of  one-off measures taken, totalling about 1½% of GDP. The  government  deficit  forecast  for  2003  takes  fully into  account  the  state  budget  for  that  year.  The  2003 budget   includes   a   number  of   restrictive  measures,  notably  an  increase  in  personal  income  tax  brackets below   expected   inflation,   a   substantial   increase   in instalment  payments  on  account  of  annual  corporate taxes,  a  moderate  growth  in  investment  expenditure, and  a  virtual  wage  freeze  in  the  government  sector. However,  despite  the  marked  restrictive  nature  of  the budget,  the  government  deficit  for  2003  is  forecast  by the  Commission  at  3½%  of  GDP,  which  is  above  the official  target  of  2.4%.  This  difference  is  basically  the outcome  of  two  factors:  first,  economic  activity  is forecast to be significantly weaker in 2003 than initially projected  in  the  2003  budget  (0.5%  as  against  1.3%, respectively),  which  should  cause  a  considerable  tax shortfall;  and  second,  the  measures  included  in  the budget  for  2003  do  not  seem  sufficient  to  attain  the deficit    target,    together    with    the    fact    that    the implementation   of   the   wide   ranging   programme   of structural  reforms  envisaged  in  the  latest  update  of  the stability  programme  does  not  seem  to  be  sufficiently advanced  to  yield  significant  savings  already  in  2003. The  Portuguese  authorities  have,  however,  made  the public  commitment  to  take  the  necessary  additional measures to ensure the achievement of the deficit target for 2003. Such measures were not yet announced.  For  2004,  the  forecast  for  the  government  deficit  is based on legislation currently in force: in the absence of new   policy   measures   the   deficit   is   expected   to marginally improve to slightly above 3% of GDP. 		
April/2003	Finland	Activity picking up in the face of downside risks	Economy in 2002 In  2002,  Finland  was  one  of  the  very  few  countries  in the  EU  to  experience  a  pick-up  in  economic  activity. Boosted substantially by domestic and external demand alike,  real  GDP  rose  by  1.6%,  up  from  0.6%  a  year earlier.  Yet,  a  further  reduction  in  inventories  shaved 1.8 percentage points off the rate of growth.  Government   consumption   increased   by   4%   owing mainly  to  higher  municipal  spending,  while  private consumption   rose   by   2.1%,   benefiting   from   robust household spending on durable consumer goods. On the other  hand,  total  investment  contracted,  owing  to  a slump  in  private  investment,  in  particular  construction, whereas  public  capital  spending  grew  by  a  hefty  7%. Exports  appear  to  have  been  strong  as  well.  Export volumes  increased  by  an  estimated  5  ½%,  although nominal   values   decreased   by   1   ½%,   suggesting   a substantial  fall  in  export  prices.  Imports,  due  to  weak investment,  rose  by  a    modest  1.7%.    The  contribution from stockbuilding to GDP growth was negative for the second consecutive year.  Although   output   growth   has   remained   well   below potential    of    some    3%    for    already    two    years, employment   creation   has   proved   highly   resilient, suggesting   some   labour   hoarding   by   firms.   Yet, according  to  national  accounts  data,  company  profits rose  by  about  1  ½%  in  2002.  Towards  the  end  of  the year,    though,    firms    increased    dismissals    in    the manufacturing   sector.   Nevertheless,   employment   is estimated to have increased by ¼ % on average in 2002 owing  to  a  rising  number  of  jobs  in  the  service  sector. As   labour   supply   increased   slightly,   unemployment hovered  around  the  level  of  2001.  Consumer  price inflation  decelerated  by  about  ½  percentage  point  to 2.0%  in  2002.  The  moderation  followed  mainly  from easing food prices, but was constrained by a rebound in energy  costs  and  a  continued  upward  drift  of  services prices.  Prospects Economic  indicators  for  the  first  three  months  paint  a mixed  picture  for  2003.  On  the  one  hand,  information on  consumer  confidence  and  retail  trade  point  to  a continued  rise  in  private  consumption  and  imports. However, industry surveys and production data suggest a  rather  subdued  development  in  the  manufacturing sector    implying    a    weaker    export    performance. Therefore, activity is set to advance at a moderate pace in the first half of 2003. Against a base-line expectation of    international    uncertainty    abating    and    external demand  reviving,  a  pick-up  in  activity  is  expected towards 2004, lifting the annual rate of GDP growth to 2 ¼ % in 2003 and further to some 3% in 2004.  Employment  seems  to  be  affected  by  the  weak    output growth of the past two years, since firms have started to adjust their workforce  to lower demand in particular in manufacturing  and  transport.  Still,  domestic  demand should   hold   up   relatively   well,   generating   further opportunities      for      service      sector      employment. Consequently,  employment  is  projected  to  slightly  dip during   the   first   quarters   of   2003.   In   addition,   the delayed  recovery  and  spare  capacity  in  the  corporate sector  are  expected  to  hold  back  job  creation.  In  any case,  hiring  should  not  face  major  supply  constraints, given the continued decline in the NAIRU and the fact that  the  level  of  unemployment  is  expected  to  remain above the EU average throughout the forecast period.  GDP components  Private consumption is expected to continue driving the economic  recovery  on  the  back  of  steady  gains  in disposable    income    following    from    higher    wage increases  and  further  income  tax  cuts  in  2003.  Apart from   higher   income,   spending   on   durables   should benefit from a reduction in car taxation and advances in digital  communication.  Public  spending,  however,  is expected  to  decelerate  based  on  the  efforts  at  central government  expenditure  control.  Investment  activity, lacking    the    stimulus    from    external    demand    and suffering  from  excess  capacity,  is  projected  to  decline further.  In  particular,  capital  spending  on  equipment seems to recede while construction of business premises suffers from rising vacancy rates. Civil engineering and housing  construction,  on  the  other  hand,  should  gain from  infrastructure  improvements  and  higher  housing demand     supported     by     advantageous     financing opportunities. Public investment should be restrained by the consolidation efforts of local governments.  The  appreciation  of  the  euro  has  diminished  the  price competitiveness  of  Finnish  firms  markedly,  as  67%  of goods  exports  go  outside  the  euro  area.  Moreover, fragile  external  demand  is  not  expected  to  give  any significant  boost  to  growth  prior  to  the  second  half  of 2003.  In  2004,  net  exports  should  gain  from  higher export   market   growth   and   the   decline   in   price competitiveness bottoming out. Prospects for exports of telecommunication    equipment,    but    also    of    forest products  appear  promising.  On  the  other  hand,  higher consumer   spending   is   expected   to   raise   imports, squeezing  the  contribution  from  external  demand  to GDP   growth.   De-stocking   in   manufacturing   should abate during 2003.  Costs and prices Lower   prices   for   imported   goods   are   estimated   to reduce  price  pressures,  bringing  HICP  inflation  further down to about 1 ¾ - 1 ½ % over the forecast period. In December 2002, a centralised two-year wage agreement provided  for  general  wage  rises  of  2.9%  in  2003  and   Table 3.13  Main features of country forecast - FINLAND 2001 Annual percentage change bn Euro Curr. prices %  GDP 1981-98 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004  GDP at constant prices 135.8 100.0 2.4 3.4 5.5 0.6 1.6 2.2 2.9  Private consumption 67.8 49.9 2.2 3.5 3.3 1.7 2.1 2.4 2.3  Public consumption 28.3 20.8 2.1 1.4 0.4 1.2 4.0 1.1 1.2  GFCF 27.7 20.4 1.0 1.8 4.0 3.8 -1.0 -1.4 1.6   of which :     equipment 8.9 6.6 1.7 -3.3 -1.0 13.8 0.7 -2.2 2.7  Change in stocks as % of GDP 0.9 0.6 0.2 -0.1 0.8 0.6 -1.4 -0.5 -0.1  Exports (goods and services) 54.0 39.8 5.0 6.5 19.3 -2.3 5.6 3.8 6.1  Final demand 178.7 131.6 2.6 2.8 8.2 0.5 1.7 2.8 3.6  Imports (goods and services) 42.9 31.6 3.9 3.5 16.9 -0.2 1.7 4.4 5.6  GNI at constant prices (GDP deflator) 134.8 99.3 2.3 4.3 5.8 1.3 2.3 2.2 2.9  Contribution to GDP growth : Domestic demand 1.9 2.4 2.5 1.8 1.7 1.1 1.7 Stockbuilding 0.0 -1.2 1.0 -0.2 -1.8 0.9 0.4 Foreign balance 0.6 1.6 2.9 -1.0 1.8 0.2 0.8  Employment -0.4 2.5 2.3 1.2 0.3 -0.2 0.3  Unemployment (a) 8.4 10.2 9.8 9.1 9.1 9.4 9.3  Compensation of employees/head 6.8 2.3 3.7 5.0 2.5 3.5 3.0  Unit labour costs 3.9 1.4 0.5 5.6 1.1 1.0 0.4  Real unit labour costs -0.9 1.8 -2.3 1.9 -0.1 0.2 -1.1  Savings rate of households (b) - 9.2 7.7 7.3 7.8 8.0 7.9  GDP deflator 4.8 -0.3 2.9 3.6 1.3 0.9 1.5  Private consumption deflator 4.6 1.2 3.7 3.4 1.7 2.0 1.4  Harmonised index of consumer prices - 1.3 3.0 2.7 2.0 1.7 1.5  Trade balance (c) 4.0 9.5 11.4 10.4 9.9 9.5 9.9  Balance on current transactions with ROW (c) -0.7 6.2 7.2 6.8 7.1 6.7 7.1  Net lending(+) or borrowing(-) vis à vis ROW (c) -0.6 6.2 7.3 6.9 7.2 6.8 7.2  General government balance (c) 0.3 2.0 6.9 5.1 4.7 3.3 3.0  General government gross debt (c) 30.4 47.0 44.5 43.8 42.7 42.3 41.4  (a) as % of civilian labour force.

Assuming  the    usual  positive  wage  drift of   about   1   percentage   point,   per-capita   wages   are expected  to  increase  by  nearly  4%  in  2003  and  about 3 ½% in 2004, up from 3.3% in 2002. However, higher growth in overall productivity appears likely to curb the rise in unit labour costs.  Public finances The  general  government  surplus  came  out  significantly higher  in  2002  than  anticipated,  at  4.7%  of  GDP.  This was due to both higher revenue, mainly from taxes, and lower-than-expected   expenditure   growth.   Due   to   a marked   normalisation   of   corporate   and   capital   tax revenue  from 2000, the surplus is estimated to continue  moderating.  Based  on  the  expenditure  restraint  implied by   the   budget   for   2003   and   central   government spending   plans   for   2004,   the   general   government surplus  seems  to  moderate  to  around  3  %  of  GDP  by 2004.  In  2003  and  2004,  the  trend  of  a  mildly  rising  nominal government debt is expected to continue. This is due to a   decline   in   the   primary   surplus   and   the   ongoing reduction   in   the   holdings   of   domestic   government bonds   by   social   security   funds.   However,   as   a consequence   of   the   expected   acceleration   of   GDP growth,  the  debt  ratio  is  anticipated  to  fall  gradually  to just  about  41  ½  %  of  GDP  by  the  end  of  the  forecast period		
April/2003	Sweden	Broad recovery in 2004, as exports and investment gain momentum	The economy in 2002  The  Swedish  economy  showed  resilience  in  2002  and GDP growth was 1.9%, up from 1.1% in 2001. Despite the fact that exports remained weak, the contribution to growth  from  net  exports  was  highly  positive,  due  to very   low   imports.   The   prolonged   global   slump, particularly  in  the  telecom  sector,  has  weighed  heavily on  Swedish  exports  and  on  manufacturing.  On  the domestic  side,  economic  activity  was  mixed.  Private consumption accelerated and grew by 1.3% in 2002, up from  a  mere  0.2%  in  2001,  aided  by  a  very  strong increase  in  disposable  incomes.  Lower  taxes  and  a resilient labour market contributed to this. On the other hand,  share  prices  continued  to  fall  substantially  in 2002.  This  led  households  to  substantially  increase  the saving rate. Also, public consumption rose markedly in 2002.    Investment    was    very    poor,    influenced    by uncertain business prospects. With decent GDP growth and  at  the  same  time  almost  flat  employment  growth, productivity  growth  per  person  rose  sharply  in  2002. Inflation  fell  sharply  in  early  2002  and,  as  inflationary pressures should remain subdued, the repo-rate was cut twice towards the end of 2002. Prospects Recent  indicators  are  somewhat  mixed  and  the  geo- political  uncertainty  weighs  on  consumer  and  business expectations.   Consumer   confidence   indicators   have stabilised  at  a  relatively  low  level  recently.  However, consumer’s   views   on   the   prospects   for   their   own financial situation have fared better than their views on the  general  economic  situation.  Business  confidence indicators are at a low level, but the latest results show a  positive  shift  in  sentiment.  Indications  of  a  recovery in  the  world  economy  too  appear  to  be  very  uncertain indeed in the short-term. The Swedish economy is very open with exports about 50% of GDP. These prospects, both domestically and externally, are expected to result in  a  gradual  recovery  of  GDP  growth  in  2003.  Private consumption   growth   should   be   fairly   stable   and   a turnaround   in   investment   is   expected   during   2003. External  demand  growth  should  pick  up  during  2003, resulting in stronger exports. In 2004, economic growth is  expected  to  strengthen  and  to  be  close  to  potential. Overall, GDP is expected to grow by 1.4% in 2003 and 2.7% in 2004. Inflation   is   expected   to   fall   below   the   Riksbank’s inflation  target  of  2%  towards  the  end  of  2003,  as  the temporary rises in electricity and energy prices subside. Wage increases are expected to fall slightly in 2003 and 2004,  as  the  labour  market  deteriorates  somewhat  in 2003.  Upside  risks  to  wage  rises  exist,  with  new  wage negotiations   starting   in   autumn   2003,   but   are   not assessed to be very great.  GDP components Private  consumption  is  expected  to  continue  to  grow steadily in 2003. While employment should fall slightly in 2003, the rise in household disposable income should support  sustained  consumption  growth.  Moreover,  the saving rate of households is expected to remain broadly stable  in  2003,  after  having  risen  very  sharply  in  2001 and   2002,   totalling   close   to   6   percentage   points. Consumer   confidence   has   stabilised   recently   and households’  expectations  regarding  their  own  financial situation  have  improved,  in  contrast  to  expectations regarding   the   general   economic   situation.   On   the downside,  the  prolonged  fall  in  equity  prices,  in  fact larger  between  the  peak  in  2000  and  2003  than  during the  depression  in  1929-32,  results  in  negative  wealth effects.  House  prices,  however,  have  continued  to  rise slowly  and  should  partially  offset  this.  These  overall negative wealth effects are expected to subside in 2003 and further in 2004, suggesting some increase in private consumption.   Investment   growth   is   expected   to   be negative,   while   gradually   improving,   in   2003,   as business  prospects  are  very  uncertain  and  also  due  to negative  overhang  into  2003.  The  latest  investment survey   reveals   that   industry   does   not   plan   any expansion in 2003. A rise in investment is foreseen for 2004,  as  economic  activity  gathers  momentum.  Stocks are expected to contribute positively to growth in 2003, as   de-stocking   should   be   completed.   As   external demand  growth  is  expected  to  strengthen  in  2003, Swedish   exports   should   pick-up   further.   Export   of goods turned positive in 2002 and some further growth is  expected  in  2003  whereas  export  of  services  fell markedly  in  2002  and  the  foreseen  improvement  is  not sufficient to result in positive growth in 2003. In 2004, a  further  recovery  in  exports  is  expected,  in  line  with world  markets.  Imports  too  should  pickup,  as  final demand recovers in 2003 and 2004.  Costs and prices Inflation  has  risen  considerably  since  the  beginning  of this  year,  due  to  strong  price  rises  on  electricity  and energy. These factors are expected to be temporary and should  subdue  later  this  year  and  inflation  should  fall below  2%  towards  the  end  of  2003,  as  inflationary pressures   are   largely   absent.   Wage   increases   are expected to be somewhat below 4% in 2003 and 2004. New  wage  negotiations,  foreseen  to  start  in  autumn 2003,   are   not   expected   to   result   in   higher   wage increases, in part due to some deterioration in the labour market  in  2003.  As  productivity  growth  is  expected  to be close to 2% over the forecast period, wage increases of around 4% should be compatible with inflation close to the Riksbank’s 2% target. Inflation is expected to fall   Table 3.14  Main features of country forecast - SWEDEN 2001 Annual percentage change bn SEK Curr. prices %  GDP 1981-98 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004  GDP at constant prices 2266.6 100.0 2.0 4.6 4.4 1.1 1.9 1.4 2.7  Private consumption 1102.6 48.6 1.3 3.8 4.9 0.2 1.3 1.8 2.3  Public consumption 617.5 27.2 1.6 1.7 -1.1 0.9 2.1 0.7 0.5  GFCF 403.9 17.8 1.9 8.2 6.6 0.8 -2.5 -0.4 4.1   of which :     equipment 186.7 8.2 4.5 11.8 6.8 -1.1 -4.0 -1.0 4.6  Change in stocks as % of GDP 6.3 0.3 0.0 0.3 0.7 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2  Exports (goods and services) 1027.4 45.3 5.6 7.4 11.3 -0.8 0.4 2.5 6.5  Final demand 3157.8 139.3 2.5 4.8 6.5 -0.2 0.6 1.6 3.5  Imports (goods and services) 891.2 39.3 4.3 4.9 11.5 -3.5 -2.7 2.2 5.9  GNI at constant prices (GDP deflator) 2247.2 99.1 1.9 5.1 4.6 1.0 1.9 1.5 2.7  Contribution to GDP growth : Domestic demand 1.4 3.7 3.2 0.5 0.8 1.0 1.9 Stockbuilding 0.0 -0.5 0.4 -0.4 -0.1 0.1 0.0 Foreign balance 0.6 1.5 0.9 1.1 1.2 0.3 0.7  Employment -0.2 2.1 2.4 1.9 0.1 -0.3 0.2  Unemployment (a) 5.0 6.7 5.6 4.9 4.9 5.3 5.3  Compensation of employees/head 6.8 1.2 7.0 5.0 4.1 3.9 3.9  Unit labour costs 4.5 -1.2 5.0 5.8 2.3 2.2 1.4  Real unit labour costs -0.8 -1.8 3.7 3.7 1.0 0.0 -0.8  Savings rate of households (b) - 7.8 6.8 9.5 12.3 12.2 11.7  GDP deflator 5.3 0.7 1.3 2.0 1.3 2.2 2.2  Private consumption deflator 6.0 1.1 1.2 2.1 2.0 2.0 1.6  Harmonised index of consumer prices - 0.6 1.3 2.7 2.0 2.5 1.8  Trade balance (c) 3.3 6.7 6.2 6.2 6.4 6.6 7.0  Balance on current transactions with ROW (c) 0.4 4.2 4.0 4.2 4.2 4.4 4.9  Net lending(+) or borrowing(-) vis à vis ROW (c) -0.4 3.0 3.8 4.1 4.1 4.4 4.8  General government balance (c) -2.6 1.5 3.4 4.5 1.3 0.8 1.2  General government gross debt (c) 60.7 62.7 52.8 54.4 52.6 50.9 49.5  (a) as % of civilian labour force.

Labour market Employment   growth   eased   during   2002   and   was marginally positive for the year. A fall in private sector employment  was  countered  by  a  rise  in  public  sector employment.  Some  evidence  suggests  that  there  has been   an   element   of   labour   hoarding   in   2002   and employment is expected to fall somewhat in 2003. This should  result  in  a  slight  increase  in  the  unemployment rate  this  year.  In  2004,  some  employment  growth  is expected, as economic activity gains momentum.  Public finances Swedish public finances have been in surplus each year since 1998 and a surplus of 1.3% of GDP was posted in 2002.  The  fiscal  policy  framework  has  contributed  to the strong fiscal position. In 2003, the surplus in public finances is expected to be slightly  lower.  Lower  economic  growth  contributes  to  this. Higher  tax  rates  levied  by  the  local  government  sector in  2003  contribute  to  a  rise  in  the  tax  ratio  this  year. Overall  revenues  are  expected  to  rise  broadly  in  line with  nominal  GDP  in  2004.  On  the  expenditure  side, the government remains committed to the previously set expenditure    ceilings    on    central    government,    as announced  in  the  Budget  Bill  for  2003.  However,  the budgetary  margins  within  the  expenditure  ceilings  are very  small  and  expenditure  in  some  areas,  such  as  sick insurance, is likely to be higher than planned on current policies.  Overall,  the  expenditure  ratio  is  expected  to rise  in  2003  and  to  fall  slightly  in  2004,  as  economic activity revives.  Despite   the   very   narrow   margins   in   the   central government expenditure plans over the forecast period, the  use  of  ceilings  remains  a  very  important  tool  for containing  expenditure  in  the  medium-term.  This  helps keeping  the  public  finances  in  good  shape  and  budget surpluses of close to 1% of GDP are expected over the forecast period. Gross debt was 52.4% of GDP in 2002. The  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  expected  to  fall  over  the forecast  period  and  to  be  below  50%  of  GDP  in  2004, as the budget surpluses described above take effect		
April/2003	United Kingdom	Gradual recovery, as investment and net exports revive	The economy in 2002  The    British    economy    has    weathered    the    global weakness rather well. Overall, growth was in 2002 was 1.8%,    slightly    above    the    Commission's    Autumn forecast.    Weakness    in    exports    and    investment, associated  with  the  global  slowdown,  have  been  offset by strong household consumption and a fiscal loosening in  the  form  of  planned  rises  in  general  government spending. The  celebrations  of  the  Queen’s  Jubilee  affected    the quarterly  path  of  GDP  within  2002.  Thus,  although GDP  grew  by  0.4%  in  Q4,  the  Office  for  National Statistics noted that the underlying rate could have been as  high  as  0.6%.  Growth  in  Q4  was  again  largely sustained    by    household    consumption    and    public expenditure.  Although  household  expenditure  was  subdued  early  in 2002,   it   picked   up   so   that   it   became   the   biggest contributor    to    GDP    growth    in    the    year.    Fixed investment,  already  declining  in  2001,  was  a  drag  on growth   throughout   the   year.   General   government consumption was a modest contributor to GDP growth. Net  exports  of  goods  and  services  strengthened  during the  first  half  of  the  year,  due  to  a  rebound  in  export growth  in  Q2  while  import  growth  declined,  but  this was  not  maintained.  Recorded  net  exports  in  Q4  were especially  weak.  For  the  year  as  a  whole,  net  exports were the largest negative drag to GDP growth.  On   the   output   side,   services   output   became   more subdued  in  Q4.  Construction  peaked  early  in  2002  and grew  well  during  the  year,  but  manufacturing  output continued  to  fall  in  all  quarters  except  Q3.  The  labour market has stayed strong.  Productivity growth (in terms of output per head) was low for 2002 as employers held on  to  labour  in  the  face  of  a  slowdown  in  growth. However, growth picked up strongly in the second half of the year. Inflationary pressures remained low - on the HICP  measure,  inflation  in  2002  was  1.3%,  around  the lowest in the EU. RPIX inflation has risen a little above the  2.5%  target  in  recent  months,  but  it  is  well  within the permitted one percentage point symmetrical margin.    Prospects  Growth for 2003 on average is forecast to be 2.2%, with the  rate  rising  to  2.6%,  around  trend,  in  2004.  It  is expected  that  the  global  economic  climate  will  revive during  the  second  half  of  2003  and  boost  exports.  The contribution   of   the   net   external   balance   to   annual growth  is  expected  to  be  less  negative  from  2003 onwards  than  in  previous  years.  Meanwhile,  domestic demand is expected to remain strong, in part as a result of  macro-economic  measures  in  the  form  of  lower interest  rates  and  continued  strong  growth  in  public expenditure,   especially   fixed   investment.   Household consumption  growth  is  expected  to  slow  from  recent, unsustainable  growth  rates.  With  growth  well  below trend  (put  at  around  2½  to  2¾%)  in  2002,  a  negative output  gap  of  around  1%  of  GDP  has  emerged,  so supply constraints, overall, should not constrain growth. Unemployment   is   expected   to   remain   close   to   its NAIRU  level  throughout  the  forecast  period.  A  small pick-up  in  wage  increases  is  expected,  up  from  recent rates that have been depressed by low bonus payments. This is accompanied by a pick-up in labour productivity growth  (on  a  per  head  basis),  so  growth  in  unit  labour costs will remain subdued.   GDP components  Growth  in  household  consumption  is  expected  to  be maintained  over  the  forecast  period,  albeit  below  the rapid  rates  observed  in  2001  and  2002.  Real  wage earnings  are  expected  to  grow  moderately  and  low interest  rates  will  support  growth.  The  rise  in  house prices,  still  racing  along  at  over  20%  year  on  year,  is offsetting  the  negative  impact  the  recent  falls  in  equity markets   may   have   on   consumption   out   of   wealth. Nevertheless,   the   ongoing   falls   in   financial   wealth associated with equity market weakness, combined with the  rise  in  gross  debt  associated  with  rapidly  rising house  prices  are  expected  to  affect  the  savings  rate raising  it  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  period.  2003  will see a reversal in the current decline of fixed investment, which   will   benefit   from   strong   planned   boosts   to general government investment and an end to the fall in business  investment.  The  latter  is  in  line  with  a  better financial     position     of     companies.     Government consumption   will   be   an   important   contributor   to demand   growth,   as   planned.   This   will   be   further boosted by expenditure from the Ministry of Defence’s special  reserves  of  £3bn  announced  by  the  Chancellor to cover the military campaign in Iraq. Export growth is expected  to  recover  during  the  forecast  period.  Import growth will, on the whole, be a little weaker than export growth.   This   is   despite   slightly   higher   growth   in domestic  demand  compared  to  2002,  and  is  due  to  the lower  import  content  of  that  part  of  domestic  demand which  will  accelerate  the  most,  namely  government expenditure (current and capital).   Labour Market  The  labour  market  has  remained  strong  despite  the global  slowdown,  with  the  unemployment  rate  being around  twenty-seven  year  lows  in  2002.  Rises  in  wage earnings  continue  to  be  moderate,  and  are  expected  to stay that way, although compensation of employees per head   will   be   boosted   this   year   as   a   result   of   the introduction  of  higher  employers'  national  insurance contributions    in    April.    Employment    has    grown moderately, by 0.7% in 2002, but is expected to slow a little  this  year.  Unemployment  is  expected  to  remain stable  over  the  forecast  period.  This  year,  productivity   Table 3.15  Main features of country forecast - UNITED KINGDOM 2001 Annual percentage change bn GBP Curr. prices %  GDP 1981-98 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004  GDP at constant prices 993.1 100.0 2.5 2.4 3.1 2.1 1.8 2.2 2.6  Private consumption 658.1 66.3 3.0 4.5 5.2 4.1 3.8 2.3 2.2  Public consumption 191.5 19.3 1.0 3.1 2.1 2.5 3.8 4.0 1.0  GFCF 164.3 16.5 3.6 0.6 1.9 1.0 -3.2 3.4 4.2   of which :     equipment 77.7 7.8 4.6 7.9 1.8 0.3 -8.8 0.7 4.7  Change in stocks as % of GDP 1.8 0.2 0.2 0.8 0.7 0.1 0.0 -0.1 0.2  Exports (goods and services) 267.7 27.0 4.5 5.3 10.1 0.9 -1.0 1.9 5.6  Final demand 1283.5 129.2 3.1 4.0 5.4 2.2 1.7 2.6 3.2  Imports (goods and services) 289.9 29.2 5.6 8.7 11.7 2.3 1.5 3.6 4.9  GNI at constant prices (GDP deflator) 1006.0 101.3 2.6 1.4 3.7 2.9 2.0 1.8 2.7  Contribution to GDP growth : Domestic demand 2.7 3.6 4.2 3.4 2.8 3.0 2.5 Stockbuilding 0.1 0.2 -0.1 -0.6 -0.1 0.0 0.2 Foreign balance -0.3 -1.4 -1.1 -0.6 -0.9 -0.8 -0.1  Employment 0.4 1.2 1.1 0.6 0.7 0.5 0.5  Unemployment (a) 9.1 5.9 5.4 5.0 5.1 5.1 5.1  Compensation of employees/head 6.8 4.3 5.0 5.6 3.6 4.5 4.6  Unit labour costs 4.6 3.1 3.0 4.0 2.5 2.8 2.5  Real unit labour costs -0.3 0.6 0.8 1.6 -0.7 0.0 0.4  Savings rate of households (b) - 4.8 4.3 5.7 5.1 5.3 5.9  GDP deflator 5.0 2.5 2.2 2.3 3.2 2.8 2.1  Private consumption deflator 5.0 1.6 0.7 0.9 0.8 1.1 1.2  Harmonised index of consumer prices - 1.3 0.8 1.2 1.3 1.9 1.8  Trade balance (c) -1.9 -3.0 -3.2 -3.4 -3.3 -3.4 -3.5  Balance on current transactions with ROW (c) -1.1 -2.2 -2.0 -1.3 -0.8 -1.5 -1.4  Net lending(+) or borrowing(-) vis à vis ROW (c) -1.3 -2.1 -1.8 -1.1 -0.7 -1.3 -1.2  General government balance (c)(d) -3.0 1.1 3.9 0.8 -1.3 -2.5 -2.5  General government gross debt (c) 47.2 45.1 42.1 38.9 38.4 39.0 39.8  (a) as % of civilian labour force.

Chapter 3 Member States, United Kingdom 87 growth  is  expected  to  be  higher  than  the  low  rate observed   in   2002   as   a   whole,   given   the   stronger expected GDP growth and the tight labour market. Unit labour  costs  rises  are  expected  to  be  moderate  and sustainable over the forecast period.  External balance  The  current  account  deficit  is  expected  to  rise  a  little throughout  the  forecast  period  to  around  1½%  of  GDP by  2004.  Nevertheless,  the  negative  contribution  of  net exports of goods and services to GDP growth in 2002 is expected  to  decline  over  the  forecast  period  as  UK overseas markets show good growth.  Prices  HICP  inflation  was  low  at  around  1.6  %  in  February  - among the lowest in the EU. Recently, UK inflation on the  RPIX  measure  has  been  slightly  above  the  Bank  of England's   2½%   target   rate.   Much   of   the   upwards pressure, year on year, has come from the oil price and feedback from the buoyant housing market (through the housing depreciation component of the RPIX measure). However,   there   are   already   signs   that   the   housing market  is  slowing  down,  and  oil  prices  are  forecast  to fall.  Benign  developments  in  unit  labour  costs  should continue  in  the  face  of  an  economy  operating  a  little below  potential  and  with  unemployment  close  to  the NAIRU.  RPIX  inflation  is  thus  expected  to  meet  the government’s 2 ½ % target.  Public finances The  general  government  finances  recorded  a  deficit  of 1.3% of GDP in 2002. The deficit is expected to widen further    in    2003    as    some    tax    revenues,    notably corporation    tax,    are    weak,    while    discretionary expenditure   growth,   especially   fixed   investment,   is forecast  to  rise  strongly  as  planned.  It  is  assumed  that expenditure  will  turn  out  broadly  as  projected  by  the authorities,  in  nominal  terms.  The  Commission  is  thus projecting  deficits  of  around  2½%  of  GDP  in  the forecast   years.   The   continuation   of   a   significant negative  output  gap  of  around  1%  of  GDP  throughout the   forecast   period   results   in   a   cyclically   adjusted balance of close to 2%. The ratio of gross debt to GDP will rise to around 40% by the end of 2004.  The forecast is based on announced policy and does not take  account  of  any  new  policy  measures  contained  in Budget  2003,  to  be  presented  by  the  Chancellor  on April 9		
November/2003	Belgium	Little hard evidence  of economic recovery 	Economic situation   Although  weak,  a  recovery  seemed  to  be  on  its  way  in   Belgium  in  2002,  but  in  the  fourth  quarter  real  GDP   growth  began  to  slow  down  and  in  the  second  quarter   2003   it   became   negative.   A   tentative   recovery   is    assumed  to  begin  in  the  second  half  of  2003,  which  is   expected   to   strengthen   in   2004   and   2005.   The    assumption  of  a  recovery  has  some  support  from  latest   developments  in  the  business  and  consumer  surveys  in   Belgium,  alongside  the  signs  for  the  global  economy,   though  less  from  hard  data.  In  this  scenario,  compared   to  the  Spring  forecasts,  real  GDP  growth  has  been   revised  downwards  from  1.2%  to  0.8%  in  2003  and   from 2.3% to 1.8% in 2004.  GDP components  In  2002,  both  gross  fixed  investment  and  net  exports   contributed  negatively  to  growth,  whereas  private  and   public    consumption    offered    small    but    positive     contributions.  In   2003,   real   GDP   is   driven   entirely   by   domestic    demand, as external demand will remain weak for some  time.   Due   to   subdued   external   demand   and   the    appreciation  of  th e  euro,  the  first  quarter  reported  a   decrease  in exports by 1.8% quarter on quarter; exports  continued to decrease in the second quarter but not that  sharply.   Real   disposable   income   of   households   is    expected  to  increase  slightly  less  in  2003  than  in  2002.   However,  private  consumption  was  very  strong  in  the  first  two  quarters  and  some  positive  signals  from  the   consumer  survey  during  th e  summer  support  the  view   that  private  consumption  might  be  stronger  on  yearly   average    in    2003    than     in    2002.    Unless    private     consumption  falls  considerably  in  the  second  half  of   2003,   this   should   result   in   a   notable   decline   in    households’  savings  rate.  Private  investment  was  weak   in the first half of 2003 and taking into account subdued  external  demand  and  a  high  rate  of  capacity  utilisation,   investment  is  expected  to  remain  weak  for  the  rest  of     the year.   Activity in the coming two years is projected to be also  driven  by  external  demand.   Following  the  recovery  in   neighbouring countries, exports should start to increase  in   Belgium,   despite   the   appreciation   of   the   euro.    Imports  are  closely  linked  to  exports  in  Belgium,  and   the  contribution  from  net  exports  will  therefore  be   moderate.   The  decline  in  the  households’  savings  rate  in  2003   seems somewhat unwarranted in the light of the labour  market  situation;  the  decline  is  assumed  to  slow  down   in 2004, consistent with pr ivate consumption increasing  at about the same pace as in  2003. In 2005 , the increase  in disposable income will  decelerate somewhat, but the  overall  improved  economic  situation  might  result  in   further  reduction  in  the  households’  saving  rate  and   private consumption should  then accelerate again.  Labour market  A downward trend has characterised employment since  mid  2001  and  the  unemployment  rate  has  risen  from   6½%  to  about  8%  in  mid  2003.  However,  during  the   last months, the unemployment rate has been relatively  stable,  which  might  indicate  a  turning  point.  Although   not  a  fully  reliable  indicator,  but  in  line  with  the   developments in the unemployment rate, the number of  job  offers  indicates  a  possible  forthcoming  increase  in   employment. Given this and a slow upturn in economic  activity,  employment  is  foreseen  to  rise  in  the  second   half   of   2003.   Employment   is   then   expected   to    strengthen  further  in  2004  and  2005  as  a  result  of   economic growth and the gov ernment’s commitment to  support  job  creation.  However,  growth  in  employment   will   not   be   immediately   translated   into   a   lower    unemployment   rate.   After   a   1   percentage   point   of    increase in 2003, the unemployment rate is calculated to  stabilise  in  2004.  Its  decline  in  2005  is  foreseen  to  be   slow.  Wages and inflation  In  January  2003,  a  two-year  wage  agreement  for  the   private  sector  was  signed,  fixing  a  norm  of  total  wage   increases to 5.4%. An increase of about 2% is expected  to  materialise  in  2003,  followed  by  some  3%  in  2004.   Wage  negotiations  for  2005  will  be  influenced  by  the   likely improvement in the employment situation and by  reductions  in  the  social  security  contributions,  but  the   still   high   unemployment   rate   might   entail   some    moderation. Wages are therefore expected to increase at  about the same rate in 2005 as in 2004. Moderate wage  increases,   reduced   social   security   contributions   and    lower  oil  prices  will  allow  inflation  to  remain  between   1½ and 2% during the forecast period.  Public finances Belgium  reached  government   surpluses  in  2000  and   2001 and a budget close to balance in 2002. The budget  is  expected  to  turn  into  a  small  surplus  again  in  2003,   despite     a     deteriorating     economic     environment.      However,  the  surplus  is  due  to  a  one-off  operation:  the   transfer    of    the    Belgacom    pension    fund    to    the     government.  This  operation,  approximately  1.4%  of   GDP  in  2003  and  0.5%  of  GDP  in  2004,  has  been   treated   as   deficit-reducing.   Eurostat   is   investigating    whether  this  accounting  treatment  is  appropriate  and   whether this operation is covered by their decision of 21  October  2003  on  lump-sum  payments  in  relation  to   unfunded  pension  schemes.  Hence  the  treatment  as   deficit   reducing   is   of   purely   technical   nature   not    prejudging   in   any   way   the   final   outcome   of   the    investigation by Eurostat.  The  government  balance  is   expected  to  turn  into  a   deficit in 2004 and 2005. However, this does not reflect  a   deterioration   of   the    government   balance   when    excluding   the   Belgacom   oper ation:   the   underlying    deficit  tends  to  decline  under  the  influence  of  low   interest rates and an improvement of the business cycle.  The  cyclically  adjusted  prim ary  surplus  is  projected  to   be reduced from 5.3% of GDP in 2003, to 4.5% of GDP  in 2005. Government gross debt is foreseen to decrease  continuously as a percentage of GDP but not fall below  100% until 2005. 		
November/2003	Denmark	Out of a relatively mild downturn	The economy in 2003  Denmark's economic growth has been rather subdued so  far  in  2003.  In  the  first  half  of  the  year,  economic   activity  weakened,  in  particular  domestic  demand.  A   slight  GDP  growth  in  the  first  quarter  was  held  up   largely  by  stockbuilding,  while  private  consumption   was negatively affected by a sharp decline in car sales.  In the second quarter, GDP contracted by 0.6%, mainly  due   to   a   steep   fall   in   investments,   in   particular    equipment. All in all, the positive contribution from net  exports  could  not  compensate  for  the  weak  domestic   demand in the first half of the year.  Prospects  With  industry  confidence   indicators  pointing  upwards   and  with  signs  of  recovery  in  retail  sales  and  new  car   registrations,  domestic  demand  should  pick  up  in  the   second  half  of  2003.  On  top  of  a  positive  growth   contribution from net exports, the recovery of domestic  demand  should  provide  for  a  GDP  growth  of  0.8%  in   2003.  In  2004  and  2005,  GDP  growth  is  expected  to   accelerate  to  2%  and  2¼%,  re spectively,  with  growth   predominantly driven by domestic demand.  On  the  whole,  Denmark's  economy  remains  sound.   Both  public  finances  and  the  current  account  feature   healthy surpluses  throughout the forecast period GDP components  Private  consumption  is  exp ected  to  pick  up  in  the   second half of 2003, on the back of improved prospects  and  increased  confidence.  Car  sales  should  rebound   after the pronounced fall in the first part of the year. In  2004,   in   particular,   private   consumption   should   be    boosted  further  by  a  solid  growth  in  real  disposable   incomes,  held  up  by  the  income  tax  cuts  as  well  as  by   lower   inflation.   Investments   should   recover   in   the    second half of the year, albeit falling over the year as a  whole.  Against  the  backgrou nd  of  increased  overall   demand, investment growth should then gather strength  gradually in 2004 and 2005.   Exports have been resilient, in spite of the appreciation  of  the   krone  and  relatively  high  wage  increases.  The   benign  export  developments  seem  in  part  to  have  been   due  to  the  favourable  composition  of  Danish  export   goods,   which   makes   exports   less   affected   by   the    economic cycle. As global ma rkets are set to expand in  the forecast period, Denmark's exports are consequently  foreseen  to  grow  less  than  its  export  markets,  resulting   in a loss of market shares.  Danish exports of goods are  thus  expected  to  grow  by  2¾%  in  2003,  increasing  to   4%  in  2004  and  to  some  4¾%  in  2005.  Imports  are   foreseen to expand at somewhat higher rates, implying,  respectively, a slightly negative and neutral contribution  to GDP growth from net expo rts in the latter two years.  Costs and prices  The  inflation  rate  has  come  down  in  the  first  part  of     2003 with falling energy prices. As from October 2003,  excise  duties  on  alcohol,  tobacco  and  soft  drinks  have   been  reduced.  The  effects  -  a   reduction  of  the  inflation   rate  by  ¼  percentage  point  -  will  mainly  show  up  in   2004. In the forecast period, in flation is set to continue  at  rates  just  below  2%,  as  a  result  of  less  inflationary   pressure  from  labour  and  pr oduct  markets,  increasing   marginally only at the end of the period.  Labour market   As the expansion of economic activity is established in  2004, net job creation is set to increase again after a fall  in employment  in  2003.   The  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  rise  through  2003,  peaking  at  6%  of  the   labour  force,  and  to  fall  gradually  in  the  rest  of  the   period.   Wage   growth   has    decelerated   somewhat   in    2003and should remain around 3½% in 2004 and 2005.  Public finances The  general  government  balance  recorded  a  surplus  of   about  2%  of  GDP  in  2002.  The  expected  modest  GDP   growth  in  2003  will  entail  lower  tax  revenues  and   higher unemployment transfers to households, reducing   the surplus to 0.9% of GDP. In 2004, the surplus is set  to  rise  to  1.3%  of  GDP,  due  to  effects  of  the  increased   GDP growth and to the fact that the pension fund yield  tax   should   generate   considerably   more   revenues.    However,  the  increase  in  the  surplus  is  limited  by  a   reduction  of  income  taxes  corresponding  to  0.4%  of   GDP,  as  part  of  the  tax  reform.  In  2005,  a  general   government surplus of 1.9% of GDP is foreseen.  The  public  debt,  which  stood  at  45½%  of  GDP  at  the   end of 2002, is set to fall below 40% of GDP by 2005.  		
November/2003	Germany	From shallow recession to slow recovery	The economy in 2003   During  the  first  half  of  2003,  the  German  economy   could  not  overcome  the  three-year  stagnation,  which   started  in  the  middle  of  2000.  Indeed,  the  country  fell   into  a  shallow  recession  with   the  economy  contracting   by   0.2   %   and   0.1%,   respectively,   in   the   first   two    quarters  of  2003.  Exports,  traditionally  an  important   source  of  growth  in  Germany,  declined  during  the  first   half  of  the  year.  Imports,  by  contrast,  held  up  fairly   well,  partly  as  a  technical   correction  of  the  slump   observed   in   2002.   As   a   consequence,   the   external    contribution to growth turned strongly negative.  Rising imports are also a sign of strengthening domestic  demand.  Thus,  private  and  government  consumption   were heading up in both the first and the second quarter.  Nevertheless,  equipment  investment  continued  to  be   weak,   and   construction   declined,   despite   a   recent    upward blip.  In  the  second  half  of  2003,  domestic  demand  is  set  to   continue  growing  at  a  slow   pace,  as  recently  rising   order   and   output   volumes   suggest.   Together   with    brightening   export   prospects,   GDP   growth   should    therefore  become  slightly  positive.  For  the  year  as  a   whole,  growth  is  expected  to  be  zero.  Stagnation  in   2003  exacerbated  the  proble ms  on  the  labour  market,   with  a  projected  annual  fa ll  in  employment  by  1½  %   compared   with   2002.   In   parallel,   annual   average    unemployment rose strongly.   Prospects  On  the  back  of  industrial  and  consumer  confidence   heading  up,  a  gradual  recovery  should  take  hold  over   the  next  two  years,  with  growth  edging  up  from  a   quarterly rate of some ¼ % in the beginning of 2004 to  around  ½  %  in  2005.  A  stronger  acceleration  is  held   back   by   a   number   of   dampening   factors.   First,    unemployment  is  high  and  will  continue  to  rise  until   early 2005, holding back private consumption. Second,  efforts  at  all  levels  of  gov ernment  to  contain  budget   deficits  will  keep  any  grow th  impulse  from  the  public   sector small. Third, potential output is held back by the  low  level  of  investment  over  the  last  few  years.  In   addition,   following   the   protracted   stagnation,   many    companies  may  still  need  to  consolidate  their  balance   sheets      before      engaging      in      capacity-enlarging       investments.   Also,   credit    constraints   are   likely   to    continue  to  be  a  limiting  factor  for  new  investment,   even  though  recent  figure s  indicate  that  commercial   lending  has  picked  up  mildly.  Finally,  it  cannot  be   excluded  that,  like   in  2002,  the  pick-up  in  business   sentiment only marks an expectations bubble that is not  followed  by  an  improvement  in  the  actual  business   situation.  Companies  might  therefore  take  a  wait-and- see attitude.   These  constraints  will  ease  only  gradually.  Growth  in   2004 is therefore projected  at a modest 1.6%, about one  third of which is simply the result of an unusually large  calendar  effect;  the  year  has  a  leap  day  (29  February)   and several holidays falling on a weekend. By contrast,  a  reversal  of  the  calendar  effect  will  reduce  growth  for   2005 by ¼ pp; it is estimated to be 1¾ %. These growth  figures imply a significant narrowing of the output gap,  since   potential   growth   is   estimated   at   only   1.3%    annually.  In  particular  in  the  light  of  the  Hartz  labour  market   reform,  which  has  already  led  to  the  creation  of  a   sizeable  number  of  mini-jobs,  employment  will  start   picking  up,  despite  the  re latively  moderate  pace  of   growth.  Due  to  the  statistical  overhang,  however,  the   average  level  for  2004  will  still  remain  below  that  of   2003. A genuine relief will only be felt by 2005.   Wage  and  price  developments  will  remain  moderate   throughout   the   forecast   period,   thereby   improving    Germany’s   competitiveness   vis-à-vis   its   European    trading   partners.   Nevertheless,   CPI   inflation   will    temporarily notch up in 2004 as a result of the increase  in  tobacco  taxes  and  administ rative  prices,  such  as  the   new road toll and charges for medical services.   Public finances   The  general  government  deficit  is  expected  to  rise  to   4.2%  of  GDP  in  2003.  Of  the  shortfall  of  over  twenty   billion  euro  compared  with  budget  plans,  around  two- thirds   can   be   attributed   to   unemployment-related    expenditures,  while  the  remaining  one-third  is  a  result   of   disappointing   tax   revenues   and   social   security    contributions.   Budget   projections   for   the   coming   two   years   are    complicated    by    a    large    number    of    government     proposals that require approval by the  second chamber   of  parliament  ( Bundesrat ).    In  the  light  of  the  high   uncertainty, the 2004 budget fo recast of 3.9% of GDP is   therefore  based  on  the  no-policy  change  assumption.  It   does not incorporate some additional €12 billion (0.6%  of  GDP)  of  net  consolidation  effort  announced  by  the   government.   Even   if   that   amount   were   included,    Germany would be at least ¼ pp above the 3% of GDP  deficit ceiling.   Similarly,  the  projection  of  a  3.4%  of  GDP  deficit  for   2005,  takes  only  half  of  the  envisaged  consolidation   measures   on   board.   A   full   implementation   of   the    announced proposals would reduce the projected deficit  by a further €10 billion (0.5% of GDP). In this case, the  deficit would fall below 3% of GDP.   Based  on  the  projected  deficit,  the  debt  level,  which   stood  at  60.8%  of  GDP  in  2002   is  expected  to  rise  to   over  63  %  by  the  end  of  2003  and  reach  close  to  66%   by the end of 2005. 		
November/2003	Greece	Increasing fiscal imbalances despite strong growth	The economy in 2003   Economic  activity  continued  to  grow  at  a  strong  pace   supported  by  domestic  demand.  Private  consumption   remained  buoyant  underpinned  by  high  wage  increases   and   tax   reductions   implemented   by   the   recent   tax    reform.  Investment  spending  linked  to  the  accelerating   preparations  for  the  Olympics  along  with  the  financial   flows  from  the  EU  Structural  Funds  contributed  to   increasing investment at a rate  higher than the real GDP  growth  rate.  The  external  transactions  deficit  remained   high as exports of tourist services stagnated due to weak  foreign  demand  and  geopolitical  uncertainties,  whereas   the buoyant domestic demand led to a slight pick up in  imports of goods.   The  labour  market  showed  a  significant  improvement   over the year, the unemployment rate dropping to 8.9%  in  the  second  quarter  from   9.6%  a  year  ago.  Total   employment is estimated to rise by 1% in 2003 and the  unemployment  rate  to  stand  at  9.5%,  remaining  among   the  highest  in  the  EU  and  euro  area.  Despite  this   improvement,  which  is  to  a  great  extent  linked  to  the   booming   construction   activity,   the   persisting   high    unemployment  rates  of  young  workers  and  females   indicate that the remaining considerable rigidities in the  labour market are not being  eliminated at a satisfactory  pace.  The  two-year  wage   agreement  in  the  private   sector, signed in early 2002,  provided for an increase of  4.2%  in  minimum  nominal  wage  in  2003.  On  average,   nominal wages are estimated to increase by 6.5%.  Weather-related increases in unprocessed food prices as  well    as    high    energy    prices    contributed    to    the     acceleration  of  inflation  in  th e  first  half  of  the  year.   Price  pressures  eased  tempor arily  late  in  Summer  but   remained  above  3%  due  main ly  to  the  considerable   increase  in  service  prices.   Thus,  with  core  inflation   stubbornly   standing   at   3.2%,   the   headline   rate   is    estimated to increase by 3. 6% in yearly average.   Prospects in 2004 and 2005  Strong  growth  of  real  GDP  is   expected  to  continue  in   2004   while   a   deceleration    in   economic   activity   is    projected  for  2005.  Private  consumption,  buttressed  by   generous  wage  increases  and  easy  monetary  conditions   will  continue  to  increase  rapidly;  investment  spending   on  projects  linked  to  the  Olympics  is  projected  to   remain   the   main   driver   of   real   GDP   growth.   As    investment spending is likely to sharply retreat after the  completion  of  the  construction  projects  related  to  the   Olympics,   a   deceleration   in   economic   activity   is    expected in 2005. However, the expected improvement  in  the  international  environment  from  2004  and  low   interest  rates  may  help  in  keeping  domestic  activity   relatively  buoyant  in  the  period  after  the  end  of  the   Olympics.  The  international  economic  recovery  might   help in reducing the external  sector deficit provided that  the  necessary  measures  are  taken  to  ward  off  a  further   deterioration in the international competitiveness of the  Greek  economy.  In  2004,  real  GDP  is  projected  to  rise   by 4.2% remaining above potential, but it is expected to  decelerate    to    3.4%    in    2 005    as    investment    in     construction activities will wane and the fiscal stimulus  to the economy will be weakened.   The  external  transactions  deficit  is  expected  to  slightly   improve  as  imports  of  goods  and  services  will  rise   moderately  and  exports,  in  particular  services  exports,   are   expected   to   considerably   increase   due   to   the    Olympics   and   the   international   economic   recovery.    However, the external sector deficit will continue to be  large   throughout   the   forecasting   period,   reflecting    domestic   macroeconomic   imbalances   and   loss   of    competitiveness.  Costs and prices  Consumer  price  inflation  is  projected  to  remain  high   standing  at  3.7%  in  2004  and  slightly  decelerating  to   3.4%   in   2005;   while   the   contribution   of   imported    inflation  to  consumer  price  inflation  should  be  small,   developments  concerning  wages  in  the  private  sector   are  quite  uncertain;  the  new  collective  negotiations expected  to  start  early  next   year,  are  very  likely  to  be   influenced  by  the  electoral  cycle  and  the  announced   generous   increases   in   public   wages.   The   assumed    increase  in  the  minimum  nominal  wages  in  the  private   sector by 10% in the 2004-2005 period may turn out to  be    conservative,    the    upside    risks    thus    being     significantly  increased.  Unit  labour  costs  in  the  whole   economy  are  expected  to  ac celerate  to  3.5%  in  2004   and to  increase by 2.5% in 2005.   Public finances  The   State   budget   for   2003   and   the   2002   updated    stability  programme  targeted  a  deficit  for  the  State   Budget consistent with a deficit of 0.9% of GDP for the  general  government.  However,  the  general  government   deficit is currently estimated by the Greek authorities to  stand at 1.4% of GDP in 2003. The latest available data  on budgetary implementation  show significant overruns  in   primary   spending,   implying   that   the   risks   of   a    substantial  deterioration  in  the  Greek  public  finances   are  high.  The  budgetary  stra tegy  adopted  by  the  2002   update  of  the  stability  programme  implied  a  budgetary   adjustment   resting   heavily   on   the   assumption   of   a    significant   improvement   in    the   central   government    balances  which  was  expected  to  result  mainly  from   holding   back   primary   spending.   However,   risks   of    missing  the  target  for  the  in crease  in  primary  spending   are very high. In fact, further rise in general government  deficit is to be expected in 2004, due to the increase in  the wage bill and social measures.  Thus,  the  general  government  deficit  is  estimated  to   stand at 1.7% of GDP in 2003, rise to 2.4% of GDP in  2004 and slightly fall to 2.3% of GDP in 2005. Primary  surplus  is  projected  to  decline  from  4.3%  of  GDP  in   2003  to  3.1%  of  GDP  in  2005.  Consequently,  the   cyclically adjusted balance  is estimated to reach –2.2%  of GDP in 2003 and –3.1% of GDP in 2004. In spite of  the  large  budget  deficit,  the  debt  ratio  is  estimated  to   stand  at  100.6%  of  GDP  in   2003  and  decrease  to  95%   of  GDP  in  2005  mainly  due  to  the  contribution  of   nominal GDP growth		
November/2003	Spain	Growth still robust 	Following   2.0%   growth   in   2002,   the   economy   is    envisaged  to  gain  some  momentum  and  grow  by  2.3%   in  2003  (0.3  percentage  points  higher  than  in  the  last   Spring   Commission   forecast).   On   the   back   of   a    recovery in investment and exports, growth is expected  to pick up further in 2004 and exceed potential in 2005.  The  economy  would  thus  continue  to  outperform  the   euro area as a whole throughout the period.  Economic activity in 2003  Relatively   good   employment   performance   and   the    personal  income  tax  reform,  in  force  from  2003,  are   fuelling  private  consumption,  while  private  investment   in  equipment,    after  having  weakened  sharply  in  2002,   is  currently  improving.  Conversely,  given  the  strength   of construction in recent year s and the brisk increase in  housing  prices,  a  moderation  of  this  component  is   expected.   Altogether,   these   factors   are   foreseen   to    increase  the  contribution  of  domestic  demand  to  GDP   growth  even  further.  On  the  other  hand,  while  exports   are  expected  to  gain  some   strength,  imports  are  set  to   accelerate in response to expanding final demand. All in  all, the negative external contribution to GDP growth is  foreseen   to   widen,   offsetting   to   some   extent   the    contribution of domestic demand.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005  In  2004  private  consumption  growth  is  expected  to   remain  broadly  stable.  The  gains  in  disposable  income   stemming  from  the  reform  of  the  personal  income  tax   and continuing sound employment growth are expected  to  result  in  a  rise  in  the  saving  ratio,  serving  to  restore   the  financial  position  of  households.  These  trends  are   foreseen to continue in 2005, with private consumption  growing by some 3½%.   Investment   is   expected   to   gain   strength   in   2004,    stemming mainly from higher equipment investment as  a    result    of    improved    business    prospects,    while     construction is set to decelerat e only slightly. All in all,  gross  fixed  capital  formati on  should  accelerate  in  2004   and  2005,  with  equipment  investment  being  the  most   dynamic component .  Exports and  imports are set  to accelerate already in the  first  half  of  2004,  gaining  further  strength  along  the   forecast   period.   On   balance,   the   negative   external    contribution  to  GDP  growth  ought  to  narrow  only   marginally.   Labour market  After    a    modest    pick    up,    full-time    equivalent     employment is expected to grow at around 2% annually  until  the  end  of  the  forecast  period  on  the  back  of  the   acceleration  in  activity.  As  a  result,  the  unemployment   rate  in  2003  is  expected  to  remain  broadly  stable  and   fall to around 10½% (Eurostat  definition) by the end of  2005.  The  activity  rate  is  foreseen  to  rise  by  two   percentage points over the period.  Costs and prices  Inflation  has  been  moderating  since  the  start  of  2003,   with   both   headline   and   core   HICP   inflation   rates    expected to average close to 3.0%.   For 2004, HICP inflation is expected to fall below 3%,  easing further to slightly above 2½% in 2005, provided  wage  moderation  continues.  Employee  compensation   per  head  in  2004  is  foreseen  to  decelerate  in  spite  of  a   stronger  labour  market  than  in  2003,  along  with  rising   labour productivity growth. Thus, growth of unit labour  costs should continue to ease.  These trends are expected  to  extend  into  2005,  with  the  rise  in  compensation  per   employee and unit labour costs moderating further.  External sector   The   current   account   deficit   is   envisaged   to   widen    slightly   through   the   forecast   period,   reflecting   a    deterioration in both the trade and primary incomes and  current transfers balances Public finances   Despite  tax  cuts  introduced  by  the  2003  reform  of  the   personal income tax, revenues are buoyant as a result of  the       relatively       robust       employment       growth.        Consequently, even with a less optimistic scenario than  that  envisaged  by  the  authorities  in  the  budget,  the   balanced     budget     target     seems     within     reach.      Nevertheless,  this  forecast  is  still  subject  to  a  certain   degree   of   uncertainty,   give n   the   transfer   of   major    spending powers to regional governments.  The main spending guidelines are left unchanged in the  budget   for   2004,   while   re venues   are   expected   to    accelerate  following  the  grow th  in  economic  activity   and  employment  creation.  Thus,  a  slight  surplus  of   0.1% of GDP is forecast. Assuming no policy changes,  the  general  government  is  foreseen  to  record  again  a   slight  surplus  in  2005,  while  the  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is   expected  to  remain  on  a  declining  path  and  fall  below   50% of GDP already in 2004.  		
November/2003	France	Fiscal consolidation to start in 2004	The situation in 2003   The  deceleration  in  real  GD P  growth  observed  in  the   second half of 2002 continued in the first half of 2003:  after increasing by 0.1% in Q1-03, activity recorded its  largest  quarterly  decline  in   seven  years  in  the  second   quarter  of  2003,  with  a  fall  in  real  GDP  by  0.3%.  The   fall  in  activity  in  the  second  quarter  of  2003  was   however  amplified  by  exceptional  factors,  such  as  the   war  in  Iraq  and  the  strikes  related  to  the  negotiation  of   the   pension   reform,   and   was   therefore   not   fully    representative of underlying growth trends.  Several  elements  currently  point  to  a  relatively  weak,   but   positive,   economic   growth   over   the   next   few    quarters. Indeed, business surveys in the manufacturing  industry have bottomed out in the last three months and  in  the  service  sector  latest   surveys  show  clear  signs  of   improvement.  Growth  in  the   third  quarter  of  the  year   should also benefit from a favourable technical rebound  due  to  the  fact  that  the  temporary  negative  shocks   mentioned   above   have   disappeared.   Despite   these    tangible  signs  of  improvement  in  cyclical  conditions,  a   sharp  and  sustained  recovery  seems  unlikely  in  the   short term, since the current low level of profit margins  and  the  subsistence  of  cash   problems  in  companies  are   expected to weigh on firms’ demand.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005  By   the   beginning   of   2004,   recovery   in   the   world    economy and relatively favourable monetary conditions  will contribute to the improvement in demand prospects  and  are  expected  to  trigger  a  gradual  acceleration  in   economic   activity.   Real   GDP   growth   would   then    resume to a rate close to potential from the beginning of   2004,  and  accelerate  gradually   in  the  course  of  next   year and in 2005.  The  acceleration  in  exports   volumes  from  the  Autumn   2003 should support an upturn in demand expectations,  and create the conditions for firms to slow de-stocking.  After  two  years  of  decline,  productive  investment  is   projected  to  gradually  recover  from  next  Spring,  when   the   improvement   in   demand   slackens   current   cash    difficulties faced by firms.  The  materialisation  of  a  steady  recovery  in  private   consumption     should     also     be     gradual.     Indeed,      households’  real  gross  disposable  income  is  currently   decelerating    mainly    due     to    the    slowdown    in     employment   growth.   Moreover,   the   increase   in   the    unemployment  rate,  expected  to  continue  until  next   Spring, could negatively impact consumers’ confidence  and trigger an increase in  precautionary savings.   Labour market, costs and prices  The  deterioration  in  economic  conditions  is  impacting   the labour market: employment growth was negative in  the  first  half  of  2003,  and   is  not  expected  to  accelerate   significantly before next Spring, when it should remain  relatively modest due to the necessity for companies to  restore  margins.  In  such  a   context,  wage  moderation  is   expected  to  continue  in  200 4,  when  the  impact  of  the   harmonisation  of  the  different  levels  of  the  minimum   wage  created  by  the  working  time  reduction  laws  will   be counterbalanced by a cycl ical deceleration in wages,  and in 2005.  As a consequence of the moderation in unit labour costs  expected for the next two years, underlying inflationary  pressures  are  projected  to  decrease  gradually  over  the   time-span   covered   by   the   forecast.   The   decline   in    overall   inflation   will   however   be   slowed   by   the    implementation of significant increases in indirect taxes  (oil, tobacco) by the end of 2003 and in 2004.  Public finances  In   2003,   the   situation   of   French   public   finances    deteriorated  markedly,  the  general  government  deficit   being  now  expected  to  reach  4.2%  of  GDP.  This  new   estimate  is  0.5  percentage  point  of  GDP  higher  than   expected  by  the  Commission  in  the  Spring,  and  0.2   percentage   point   of   GDP   higher   than   the   official    government    projection.    Worsening    in    the    2003     government  deficit  compared  to  the  Spring  forecast   reflects  the  impact  of  the  la rge  downward  revision  to   the   real   GDP   growth   projection   for   2003   (by   1    percentage  point).  The  Commission  forecast  for  2003   makes the assumption that expenditures will be kept in  line  with  plans  in  the  State  sector,  and  that  no  further   slippage  will  occur  in  health  spending.  The  general   government debt is projected to increase from 59.0% of  GDP in 2002 to 62.6% of GDP in 2003, also due to the  impact   of   the   subscription   by   the   State   to   the    recapitalisation     of     France     Telecom     worth     0.6      percentage  point  of  GDP.   This  is  the  only  financial   transaction impacting on the de bt ratio in this forecast.   In   2004,   despite   a   projected   improvement   in   the    cyclically-adjusted balance by more than 0.5 percentage  point   of   GDP,   the   general   government   deficit   is    projected to decline only slightly below 4% of GDP, at   3.8%   of   GDP.   The   decline   in   the   deficit   will   be    burdened  next  year  by  the  lagged  impact  on  fiscal   revenues  of  the  low  2003  real  GDP  growth.  It  is   assumed in this forecast that expenditure plans included  in  the  Finance  Law  for  2004  will  be  respected  (real   general   government   expenditures   are   projected   to    increase  by  0.9%  next  year),   i.e.  expenditures of  the   State   sector   will   remain   constant   in   real   terms    (budgetary accounting) and that measures  taken to curb  the  dynamics  of  health  expenditures  have  the  expected   impact. Finally, the forecast in corporates an increase in  local taxes by 0.1 percentage point of GDP on the basis  of  recent  trends,  even  if   the  2004  budgets  of  local   authorities  are  still  not  unveiled.  A  number  of  risks   exist for the budget ary execution in 2004, the main one  being  that  the  measures  ai med  at  curbing  the  dynamic   of    spending    in    the    health    sector    could    prove     insufficient.   In   2005,   despite   real   GDP   growth   being   close   to    potential, the general government deficit is projected to  decrease   only   marginally    to   3.6%   of   GDP.   This    projection   is   based   on   the   assumption   that   real    government  expenditures  will  increase  by  about  2%  in   real  terms,  equal  to  the  trend  in  real  expenditures   observed  in  the  last  5  to  10  years,  compared  with  a   projection of 1% in the latest multi-annual projection of  the French authorities.  		
November/2003	Ireland	A broad-based recovery taking hold	A ctivity in 2003  According  to  preliminary  national  accounts,  real  GDP   expanded by a mere 0.5% on the year in the first quarter  of  2003,  after  7.5%  in  the  previous  quarter.  Domestic   demand   was   quite   subdued   as   relatively   healthy    consumption   growth   and   construction   activity   were    offset  by  a  pronounced  fall  in  equipment  investment,   which partly reflected base ef fects (aircraft purchases in  2002Q1).   On   the    external   side,   both   exports   and    imports fell dramatically on the year (more than 10% in  volume  terms),  but  this  must  also  be  qualified:  2003   merchandise trade developments are distorted by a very  marked fall-off in trade reco rded with the UK, which is  believed  to  be  related  to  th e  termination  of  UK-based   VAT  fraud  schemes  in  the  course  of  2002.  Partial   indicators  for  the  second  qua rter  are  mixed,  combining   stagnant  retail  sales  and  weak  industrial  output  growth   with  a  recovery  of  exports.  As  regards  the  rest  of  the   year,    the    indications    from    the    latest    purchasing     managers'  indices  for  manufacturing  and  services  are   encouraging,   with   both    indices   recovering   from   a    trough in the second quarte r. Confidence indicators also  generally point to an improvement in recent months.  For the year as a whole, real  GDP growth is expected to  reach 1½%, an apparently dr amatic slowing from 6.9%  in 2002. However, almost two-thirds of the latter figure  can  be  attributed  to  the  chemicals  and  pharmaceuticals   sector.     The     exceptional     performance     of     this      predominantly    foreign-owned    sector    generated    a     massive jump in factor outflows in 2002, so that growth  in  the  income  measure  GNI  fell  well  behind  that  of   GDP;  in  view  of  an  emer ging  decline  in  net  factor   outflows, the opposite is expected to occur in 2003.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005  The   economy   is   expected   to   show   a   broad-based    recovery,    with    growth    accelerating    towards    that     commonly  thought  to  be  sustainable  in  the  medium   term, of some 5% in annualised terms. On the domestic  side, private consumption is supported by a gradual rise  in  real  disposable  incomes  and  a  modest  fall  in  the   savings  rate.  By  contrast,  the  contribution  of  public   consumption   to   growth   falls   by   virtue   of   further    spending  restraint  and  the  announced  cap  on  public   sector employment. The pick-up in investment does not  extend  to  housing,   where  annual  output  is  forecast  to   have peaked in 2003. The strengthening of the external  environment  leads  to  a  recovery  of  net  exports,  which   account  for  close  to  half  of   the  forecast  growth  rate  of   3.7%  and  4.9%  in  2004  and  2005  respectively.  As  net   profit  outflows  are  expected   to  resume  their  normal   upward  trend,  the  corresponding  growth  rates  in  GNI   terms are somewhat lower.  Labour market  While  the  unemployment  rate  has  increased  from  a   trough of 3.8% during the first half of 2001, the overall  rise, to some 4¾% in 2003Q3, has been relatively mild,  as   weak   employment   gains   have   combined   with    moderating labour force growth. A slight further rise to  just   over   5%   is   expected   in   2004,   but   no   further    deterioration is expected for 2005.  Costs and prices  A  marked  easing  in  per  capita  compensation  growth   took  place  in  2002  given  th e  flexibility  of  the  Irish   economy   in   the   face   of   a    deteriorating   external    environment. The fairly moderate pay provisions for the  private    sector    in    the    latest    national    agreement,     Sustaining  Progress ,  and  easing  price  pressures  should   foster   further   wage   moderation   and   thereby   help    maintain  competitiveness,  although  the  latest  data  on   industrial   earnings   point   to   some   upward   pressure.    HICP  inflation,  which  averaged  4.7%  in  2002,  has   eased   to   just   below   4%   since   May,   although   the    downward   pressures   stemming   from   weak   activity,    moderating  earnings  growth  and  a  stronger  currency   have been partly counteracted by a range of increases in  indirect  taxes  and  user  charges.  In  the  absence  of   further  significant  increases  of  this  nature,  inflation   should  fall  further,  from  an  expected  4.1%  in  2003  to   2¾%  in  2005,  thus  narrowing  the  differential  with  the   euro area average.  Public finances The  budget  for  2003  implemented  various  revenue- raising  measures,  almost  halved  the  growth  rate  of   current  discretionary  expenditure  (to  8%  from  15%  in   2002)  and  cut  capital  outlays.   The  deficit  is  forecast  to   reach  0.9%  of  GDP  with  some  savings  on  spending   broadly  offsetting  the  emerging  tax  undershoot  relative   to  the  budget  target.  Becau se  the  2004  budget  will  be   unveiled  in  December,  the  forecast  adopts  a  no-policy   change  scenario  for  both  2004  and  2005.  Given  the   non-indexed nature of the tax and social benefit system,  this  scenario  is  made  operational,  in  the  absence  of   previously  announced  measures,  by  freezing  average   tax  rates  and  adjusting  social   transfer  payments  by  the   forecast  CPI  inflation  rate  (with  a  small  top-up).  The   forecast    further    assumes    that    payment    of    the     “benchmarking”  awards  (upward  adjustments  to  public   sector  pay  scales  from  a  comparison  with  rates  for   similar  jobs  in  the  private   sector)  proceeds  as  foreseen   in  the  national  agreement  and  that  public  investment  is   maintained  at  4%  of  GDP  to  allow  for  the  roll-out  of   planned  infrastructure  project s.  On  these  assumptions,   the deficit is forecast to wi den to 1.2% of GDP in 2004  and  1.1%  in  2005,  while  government  debt  stabilises  at   around 34% of GDP. 		
November/2003	Italy	Slow upturn on the cards	The economy in 2003 and prospects to 2005  The Italian economy went into a mild recession in the  first half of the year, as economic growth tailed off in  view of the weak economic environment and coupled  with the expiry of fiscal in centives at the end of 2002.  In particular, gross fixed capital formation fell sharply  as   investment   plans   had   been   brought   forward    creating  a  void  in  the  first  two  quarters  of  2003.  The   impact  of  the  stronger  eu ro  on  exports  acted  as  an   additional    drag.    Only    consumption    expenditure     continued to grow at a relatively steady rate.   Signs   of   an   improving   short-term   outlook   started    materialising  around  mid-year  chiefly  on  account  of   recovering   output   figures   in   the   manufacturing    industry  in  the  third  quarter.  On  the  demand  side   export  activity  also  appears  to  be  recuperating  from   the  negative  performance  at  the  beginning  of  2003   and  consumption  expenditure  continues  to  hold  up   comparatively  well.  However,  in  the  year  as  whole,   real GDP is projected to in crease by only 0.3% as the  expected  pick-up  in  economic  activity  in  the  second   half  of  2003  is  likely  to  be  very  gradual,  essentially   brought  about  by  the  levelling  out  of  the  investment   slump.  On  the  back  of  the  assumed  improvement  in  the   economic  environment,  esp ecially  outside  the  euro   area,  the  gradual  recovery  of  economic  activity  in   2003  is  projected  to  continue  and  to  gain  additional   strength in the following two years. Real GDP growth  is forecast to accelerate to 1. 5% in 2004 and to climb  to   1.9%,   above   the   potential   rate,   in   2005.   The    recovery   is   assumed   to   be   largely   driven   by    domestic  demand,  as  investment  expenditure  picks- up  progressively  alongside  a  steady  expansion  of   private    consumption    underpinned    by    slowly     declining  inflation  and  job  creation.  The  revival  of   stock   markets   observed   in   2003,   which   in   the    assumed  context  of  an  overall  improvement  of  the   economic  outlook  is  expected  to  stay,  is  likely  to   produce  a  positive  wealth-e ffect  contributing  to  the   performance  of  consumption.  Although  to  a  lesser   degree, the drag from the external side on economic  growth  is  expected  to  continue  in  2004,  reflecting   the  tendency  of  Italian  exports  to  lose  shares  in  an   expanding  global  market  without  the  help  from   falling exchange rates.   Costs and prices   Inflation  has  remained  stubbornly  high  throughout   2003,  unaffected  by  the  widening  negative  output   gap   and   the   stronger   euro.   The   annual   rate   of    increase  of  the  HICP  bas  been  virtually  stuck  at   around 2.8%, with the differ ential vis-à-vis the euro  area widening to one full percentage point. While a  series    of    special    factors    may    have    fuelled     inflationary  pressure,  it  is  becoming  increasingly   evident  that  structural  fact ors  such  as  the  lack  of   competition   may   also   be   at   play.   The   marked    increase  in  unit  labour  costs  estimated  for  2003   chiefly     reflects     the     cyclical     slowdown     in      productivity,    whereas    wage    developments    are     projected to remain relatively benign.   As the effect of special f actors, such as the drought  in  summer  2003,  peter  out  and  the  negative  output   gap  narrows  slowly,  inflation  is  expected  to  ease   gradually  over  the  course  of  the  coming  two  years.   Although   industrial   relations   deteriorated   in   the    recent  past,  labour  costs   are  projected  to  remain   conducive  to  moderate  inflationary  pressure  to  the   extent  that  future  wage  agreements  adhere  to  the   1993  agreement  basing  wa ge  increases  on  a  low   inflation target.   Labour market   With   a   significant   lag    compared   to   economic    growth,  job  creation  ground  to  a  halt  around  mid- year 2003 and is assumed to recover slowly towards  the   end   of   the   year.   Thanks   to   a   pro-cyclical    behaviour    of    the    labour    force    the    rate    of     unemployment  is  not  expected  to  rise.  It  is  projected   to  stabilise  around  8.8%  in  2004  and  to  resume  its   downward  trend  in  the  following  year.  The  role  of   non-standard  contracts  is  fo reseen  to  rise  again  over   the course of the projected economic recovery.  Public finances  The   general   government   deficit   is   estimated   to    increase to 2.6% of GDP in  2003. The marked drop in  the  primary  surplus  is  partly   offset  by  a  still  sizeable   decline  in  interest  paymen ts.  The  budgetary  outturn   depends    crucially    on    the    impact    of    transitory     measures (above all a tax amnesty), expected to be 1.6  pp of GDP. In 2002 one-off measures (primarily sales  of   real   assets)   reduced   the   deficit   by   1.0   pp.    Correcting    for    the    effect s    of    the    cycle,    the     improvement in the budget balance is marginal.  In 2004, the deficit is expect ed to increase to 2.8% of  GDP,  with  the  primary  surplus  falling  by  0.5  pp  to   2.2%  of  GDP.  The  main  uncertainties  concern  the   large   expected   impact   of    budgetary   measures   of    difficult assessment and the strains which may arise in  the implementation of the domestic stability pact. In  the Commission forecast, th e total impact of one-off  factors  (which  include  sale s  of  publicly-owned  real   assets,  an  amnesty  for  building  offences  and  a  tax   settlement scheme) is estimated at 1.0 pp of GDP in  2004.  It  is  prudentially  assumed  that  ANAS  (the   agency  responsible  for  maintenance  and  investment   in the state- road network)  continues to be classified  within the general government sector. The impact of  the enabling legislation on the reform of the pension  system, not fully defined at the cut-off date, has not  been incorporated. The forecast for 2005 is based on  legislation currently in force.  Despite a cash deficit in excess of 4.5% of GDP, the  government  debt  ratio  slightly  declines  in  2003,   principally  by  drawing  on  cash  assets  held  by  the   government with the Bank of Italy. Pending details,  the  impact  of  the  announ ced  privatization  of  the   Cassa  Depositi  e  Prestiti  has  not  been  included.  In   2004  the  debt  ratio  continues  to  decline  marginally   to  around  106%  of  GDP,   chiefly  through  sizeable   planned disposals of financial assets		
November/2003	Luxembourg	Adjustments to spell of weak growth	The economy in 2003  Following  many  years  of  real  GDP  growth  well  above   the   EU   average,   economic   growth   in   Luxembourg    slowed   down   sharply   in   2001,   to   1.2%.   Economic    growth  in  2002,  at  1.3%,  was  at  around  the  same  rate.   Because of the importance of  the financial sector to the  economy  of  the  Grand  Duchy,   the  negative  impact  of   the  turmoil  on  financial  markets  was  substantial.  The   resulting  drag  on  activity  continued  into  2003,  as  firms   adjusted  to  the  shock.  Weak   profits  and  balance  sheet   restructuring  held  back  investment.  As  slowdown  in   economic  activity  spread  to   sheltered  sectors  of  the   economy in the course of th is year, the negative impact  on employment was increasing ly felt. Real GDP growth  is estimated to be slightly higher than 1% in 2003. The  contribution  from  domestic  demand  would  decrease  as   private consumption decelerates  due to worsened labour  market     conditions.     However,     the     considerable      destocking that occurred in  2002 would end. The recent  resilience in global financial market seems to bode well  for medium-term prospects.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005  Economic   activity   is   expected   to   pick   up   only    moderately  in  2004.  Real  GDP  growth  is  forecast  at  a   1.9%,  before  increasing  further  to  2.8%  in  2005.  The   recovery   would   primarily    be   driven   by   increased    domestic   demand   and   in   particular   by   investment    catching up as exte rnal conditions continue to improve.  The   expected   global   reco very   should   also   benefit    exports:  the  net  trade  contribution  is  expected  to  turn   positive  in  2004  and  2005.  Private  consumption  would   remain  rather  resilient  over  the  projection  horizon  with   respect to past growth rates, as employment growth and  the  growth  rate  of  real  compensation  per  employee   would remain positive. Nevertheless, the pick up in the  rate  of  real  GDP  growth,  to  2.8%  in  2005,  would  be   relatively  slow  compared  to   previous  cyclical  upturns,   largely   explained   by   historically   weak   growth   of    exports of financial services.   In  Luxembourg,  cross-border  employment  is  highly   sensitive  to  cyclical  conditi ons,  which  translates  into   sharp   swings   in   cross-border   labour   flows.   Total    employment  growth  is  forecast   to  decelerate  to  around   1% in both 2004 and 2005. The worsening in the labour  market  would  lead  to  a  marked  rise  in  the  number  of   resident unemployed, even th ough this increase is likely  to  be  cushioned  somewhat  by  the  specific  employment   schemes.  Thus,  the  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to   increase markedly over the fo recast horizon, to over 4%  by 2005.  Costs and prices  Average  HICP  inflation  stood  a  2.1%  in  2002  and  is   expected  to  average  2.2%   in  2003  before  decreasing   slightly to 2% in 2004 and 1.7% in 2005, in response to  weak import prices, relatively moderate wage increases,  a  cyclical  upturn  in  productivity  and  the  fading  of  the   upward  impact  of  the  introduction  of  the  cash  euro.  In   2004   increases   in   excise   duties   on   petrol   would    introduce  some  upward  price  pressures  from  energy   prices  (0.1-0.2%).  Underlying  inflation  would  show   some  resilience  to  go  below  2%  despite  slow  growth   and unemployment edging up.  Public finances  The  public  finance  situation  is   expected  to  deteriorate   markedly over the projection period. In 2002, the fiscal  accounts  still  registered  a  subs tantial  surplus  of    2.4%   of GDP, to a large extent due to the lagged response of  corporate  tax  revenues  to   the  economic  slowdown,  to   some  increase  in  th e  collection  of  back  taxes,  and  to   lower  expenditure  from  speci al  funds.  In  2003,  the   general  government  balance  is   expected  to  turn  into  a   deficit of 0.6% of GDP. A further marked deterioration  is  expected  in  2004,  with  the  deficit  rising  to  2.1%  of   GDP.    Continued    sluggish    revenues,    mostly    due to the weak development of corporate tax revenue are  the  main  explanation.  That  said,  while  the  growth   rates  of  total  current  and  investment  expenditure  are   expected   to   weaken   comp ared   to   the   high   rates    registered  in  2002,  the  deceleration  would  not  be   sufficient  to  prevent  the  nominal  deficit  from  rising   to 2.5% of GDP by 2005. While most of the expected  deterioration  of  the  budget  balance  is  accounted  for   by  central  government,  local  government  revenues   would  also  be  affected  ne gatively  by  the  effects  of   the  earlier  tax  reforms  from  2004  onwards.  The   balance   of   social   security   funds   should   remain    positive  over  the  forecast  horizon,  but  surpluses  are   expected  to  be  lower  than  in  previous  years,  largely   due  to  the  worsening  in  the  labour  market.  The   already low gross government  debt ratio is forecast to  decline slightly to 4.1% of GDP in 2005.		
November/2003	Netherlands	Deficit rises as recession deepens, substantial fiscal tightening	Recession in first half of 2003  Real  GDP  shrank  in  the  first  half  of  2003  and  is   expected to decline by 0.9% on average in the year as a  whole,  compared  to  a  meagre  positive  growth  rate  of   0.2% in 2002. Real GDP fell by 1.2% year-on-year and  0.6%  quarter-on-quarter  in  the  second  quarter  of  2003,   the  third  consecutive  quarter  of  decline.  Available  data   and  leading  indicators  give  no  indication  of  a  clear   rebound   in   growth   in   the   remainder   of   the   year.    Following     years     of     buoyant     growth,     private      consumption  is  forecast  to   decrease  by  around  1%  in   the   wake   of   rising   unemployment,   rising   pension    premiums,   fading   wealth   effects   from   the   housing    market,  fiscal  consolidation  weighing  on  disposable   income,  and  confidence  falling  to  record  lows.  The   growth  rate  of  real  government  consumption  would   decrease markedly to 0.7%, co mpared to close to 4% in  2002.  Gross  capital  formation  is  expected  to  decrease   by around 3% in response to  weak profits, balance sheet  adjustments   in   the   corpor ate   sector,   relatively   low    capacity  utilisation  rates  and  the  uncertain  near-term   outlook   while   exports   suffer   from   the   economic    downturn,     aggravated     by     the     loss     in     price      competitiveness  of  Dutch  exporters  due  to  high  wage   and  price  increases  in  recent   years.  Unemployment  has   risen markedly in the course of this year as employment  growth is set to turn negative in response to the cyclical  downturn, while wages and prices have been on a clear  downward trend.  Export-driven recovery expected  A very muted recovery is expected, starting towards the  end of 2003. Real GDP growth is projected to reach no  more  than  0.6%  in  2004,  and  to  strengthen  to  2%  in   2005.  In  2004,  the  projected   recovery  would  to  a  large   extent  be  due  to  more  supportive  net  trade,  whereas   domestic  demand  would  remain  sluggish  initially  and   recover  only  towards  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.   Despite projected export growth of close to 6% in 2005,  Dutch  exporters  would  suffer  further  losses  in  market   share,   as   competitiveness   would   only   slowly   be    restored.  Private  consumption  growth  is  expected  to   stagnate in 2004 and to recover only in 2005, reflecting  relatively   weak   income   growth   in   response   to   the    marked  further  worsening  in  the  labour  market,  the   negative  impact  of  fiscal  consolidation  on  disposable   income,   and   the   continuation   of   a   relatively   high    savings  ratio.  Private  non-residential  capital  formation   is  expected  to  recover  only  gradually  and  to  reach  a   growth  rate  of  close  to  2%  by  2005,  in  line  with  the   muted recovery as balance  sheet adjustments and lower  wage   growth   bear   fruit   and   profitably   would   be    gradually  restored.  Total  employment  is  forecast  to   decrease   by   0.8%   in   2004   and   to   increase   only    marginally in 2005. This reflects the lagged response of  the  labour  market  to  the  severe  economic  slowdown.   Hence  the  unemployment  rate  would  continue  to  rise   over the forecast horizon,  to reach over 6% in 2005.  Deceleration in costs and prices  CPI inflation is expected to  decrease markedly over the  forecast  horizon,  from  3.9%  in   2002  to  2.4%  in  2003   and 1.3% and 0.9% in 2004 and 2005 respectively. This  partly reflects lower import pr ices, but is primarily due  to  a  substantial  easing  of  unit  labour  costs.  Overall   wage  growth  is  expected  to  moderate  substantially  in   response  to  the  rather  bleak  economic  outlook,  the   agreement   reached   among   social   partners   to   freeze    contractual  wage  increases  in  the  next  two  years,  and   the prospect of falling inflation.  Public finances  The  fiscal  accounts  deteriorat ed  markedly  in  2002  and   showed  a  deficit  of  1.6%  of  GDP,  after  a  balanced   budget  in  2001.  This  deterioration  of  public  finances   mainly   reflects   the   impact   of   the   sharp   economic    downturn.   However,   revenue      shortfalls   related   to    higher  tax-exempt  pension  premiums  and  increases  in   tax-deductible  mortgage  payments  also  added  to  the   deficit,  while  deterioration  in  the  balance  of  the  sub- sector local government also  played a role in 2002. The  weak  economic  prospects  imply  a  further  deterioration   of  the  general  government  balance  in  2003  and  2004,   despite  substantial  fiscal  consolidation.  The  austerity   measures put in place in 2003 and 2004 to help limit the  increase in the deficit are equi valent to 2.5% of GDP in  total.  Planned  expenditure  reductions  stem,  inter  alia,   from  reforms  in  social  security,  wage  restraint  in  the   public  sector,  the  repeal  of   tax  incentives  for  early   retirement,  measures  to  control  health  care  spending,   and a reduction of subsidies.   On   the   revenue   side,   taxes   and   social   security    contributions will be raised. In spite of these efforts for  2003,  a  general  government  deficit  of  2.6%  of  GDP  is   expected. In 2004 the defic it  would  increase  slightly  to   2.7%  of  GDP,  before  decreasing  somewhat  to  a  deficit   of  2.4%  of  GDP  in  2005  in  response  to  the  economic   upturn.   The   cyclically   adjusted   general   government    balance is projected to improve gradually from 2.1% of  GDP  in  2002  to  0.6%  of  GDP  in  2005.  As  a  result  of   projected deficits and weak economic growth the gross  government  debt  ratio  would  be  on  a  modest  upward   trend and stabilise at 55.5% of GDP in 2004 and 2005. 		
November/2003	Austria	Unemployment stays high despite pick-up in growth	Developments in 2003 and prospects  Economic growth stayed on a slow pace in the first half  year.  Contrary  to  last  year,  growth  was  supported  by   domestic  demand  components,  above  all  moderately   expanding   household   consumption   and   investment    recovering slowly from the slump in 2002. Exports, by  contrast,  almost  stagnated  as  demand  from  central  and   eastern    Europe    slowed    down    considerably.    With     imports  picking  up,  the  external  contribution  to  growth   decreased markedly. In all, growth of real GDP is set to  reach only 0.9% in 2003.  With  the  international  upswing  gaining  momentum,   exports  should  rebound.  Together  with  strengthening   domestic    demand,    GDP    growth    is    projected    to     accelerate to 1.9% in 2004 and  further to a rate of 2.5%  in 2005.  Demand components  Household   real   disposable   income   will   rise   only    moderately  in  2003  and  2004,  before  accelerating  in   2005,   thanks   to   a   pick-up   in   labour   demand   and    declining inflation. Private consumption is nevertheless  expected  to  remain  resilient  in  2003  and  to  rebound  in   2004.  After  adoption  of  the  pension  reform  last  June,   the  political  debate  on  changes  to  the  welfare  system   that  may  have  led  to  uncertainty  and  consumption     restraint,   will   cease   for   so me   time.   Moreover,   an    income tax relief becoming effective at the beginning of  2004  and  a  more  substantial  one  planned  for  2005,  in   combination  with  the  improved  outlook  on  the  labour   market   should   boost   consumer   confidence.   Public    consumption  is  forecast  to   remain  subdued  throughout   the  projection  period,  assuming  that  the  government   continues  its  efforts  to  co ntain  budgetary  spending.   Investment  edged  up  in  the  first  half  of  2003,  with   equipment     investment     accelerating     considerably,      induced   most   likely   by   a   tax   incentive   favouring    investments  undertaken  in  the  year  2003.  In  2004,  a   negative   echo-effect   in   comb ination   with   sufficient    spare  capacity  may  hold  back  a  stronger  rebound  of   equipment    investment    to    be    expected    from    the     improved  export  outlook.  Construction  investment  is   projected  to  strengthen  th roughout  the  forecast  period.   Exports  are  expected  to  rebound  in  2004  and  gain   further   momentum   in   2005.   Despite   accelerating    imports, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth  should turn positive as of 2004 but remain small.    Prices and wages   While on the whole remaining subdued, consumer price  inflation  is  likely  to  accelerate  temporarily  in  2004   owing  to  an  increase  in  energy  taxes  and  excise  duties   on     tobacco.     Notwithstanding     continued     wage      moderation  in  the  private  sector,  nominal  increases  in   contractual  wages  are  estimated  to  pick  up  somewhat   already  in  2004  du e  to  the  expected  cyclical  upswing   and  to  accelerate  further  in   2005.  In  the  public  sector,   very  moderate  wage  agreemen ts  are  expected  for  both   2004  and  2005,  given  the  rather  generous  pay  rise  in   2003  compensating  for  purchasing  power  losses  in  the   previous years.  Labour market  The  deceleration  in  overall  output  growth  in  2003  had   an adverse impact on the labour market, with dependent  employment  virtually  stagnating.  Given  the  usual  time   lag  of  about  six  months,  a  more  sustained  pick-up  in   labour demand can be expected only in late 2004, when  economic   activity   should   have   gained   momentum.    Given elastic labour supply, the rebound in growth will  not  translate  immediately  into  falling  unemployment,   after  the  sharp  rise  in  2003.  Only  in  2005,  the  increase   in labour demand is estimate d to outpace labour supply,  helped  by  the  population  of  working  age  starting  to   decline due to demographic ageing.  Public finances  Revised data for 2002 show that the budgetary outcome  was   actually   better   than   preliminary   figures   had    indicated.  The  budgetary  position  weakened  by  half  a   percentage  point  of  GDP  to  a  deficit  of  0.2%  (revised   downwards from a deficit 0.6%) after a surplus of 0.3%  of GDP in 2001.   The  twin-budget  for  2003  and  2004  was  adopted  in   mid-June,  thereby  largely  incorporating  the  delay  in   the   economic   recovery.   Despite   the   rather   bleak    cyclical  situation  entailing  weaker-than-anticipated   employment growth, central government data suggest  that   tax   revenues   in   2003   could   develop   more    favourably   than   budgeted,   mainly   reflecting   the    authorities'   successful   fi ght   against   VAT   fraud.    However,  expenditure  is  expected  to  overshoot  the   target,   reflecting   a   sharper-than-expected   rise   in    unemployment  and  additional  discretionary  spending   such  as  an  increase  in  soci al  transfers,  an  extra  pay- rise  for  public  sector  employees,  additional  labour   market  expenditure  foreseen  in  the  fiscal  stimulus   package,  topped  by  deferred  flood-related  spending.   In sum, the general government deficit is projected to  widen to some 1% of GDP in 2003.   In  2004,  the  first  step  of  the  tax  reform  will  take   effect.  Income  tax  cuts  and  related  measures  will,   however,   be   largely   offset   by   a   rise   in   social    contributions. As a result, th e budgetary effect of the  tax relief should be neutral. Savings from the pension   reform  for  private  and  federal  employees  should   largely    outpace    the    increase    in    discretionary     spending.   Helped   by   the   expected   pick-up   in    domestic  demand,  the  general  government  deficit  is   estimated to narrow by almost ½ percentage point of  GDP.   In  the  light  of  the  project ed  cyclical  upswing,  the   deficit  should  decline  further  in  2005.  Given  the   Commission’s    no-policy-change    assumption,    the     forecast for 2005, does not,  however, incorporate the  second  step  of  the  tax  reform,  which  is  planned  but   has not yet been presented to parliament		
November/2003	Portugal	A large and persistent output gap  is hindering budgetary consolidation	Overall developments and prospects  In  Portugal,  the  impact  of   the  cyclical  downturn  in   the  European  economy  is  being  accentuated  by  the   undergoing  economic  adjustment.  In  fact,  domestic   demand  has  been  receding  since  the  last  quarter  of   2001, after a period of rapid growth at the end of the  previous  decade,  which  led  to  significant  rises  in  the   indebtedness   levels   for   the   private   sector   of   the    economy, and to an unsustai nable increase in the net  borrowing of the economy.   Despite   the   protracted   fall   of   domestic   demand,    quarter-on-quarter  output  receded  only  in  the  second   half  of  2002,  reflecting  the  progressive  improvement   of the net external balance. Despite the expectation of  slow  but  positive  growth  for  all  quarters  of  2003,   GDP growth for the whole y ear is projected to fall by  about  ¾%,  because  of  the  negative  carry-over  from   2002.  As regards the forecast peri od, although both private  consumption    and    investment    are    expected    to     gradually strengthen, domestic demand is expected to  continue   growing   below   output,   because   of   the    continued  efforts  by  private  sector  agents  to  redress   their balance sheets, combin ed with the re-orientation  of production towards exports, which is supported by  a  high  degree  of  wage  moderation  and  the  projected   pick-up    in    foreign    demand.    Consequently,    the     external account is expected  to be close to balance by  the  end  of  the  forecast  pe riod.  Overall,  GDP  is   expected  to  grow  by  about  1%  in  2004,  largely   reflecting the low carry-over from 2003, accelerating  to about 2% in 2005.  Prices   HICP inflation is forecast to  decelerate in the second  half  of  2003.  Moderate  import  price  inflation,  low   wage   increases,   and   subdued   domestic   demand    throughout  the  forecast  peri od  are  all  expected  to   contribute  to  inflation  abating  from  3.4%  in  2003  to   about 2½% on average in the 2004 and 2005 period.  Labour Market  The labour market situation deteriorated significantly  at   the   end   of   2002.   Cyclical   developments   are    expected  to  lead  to  a  decline  in  employment  in  2003   and  to  a  near  stagnation  in  2004,  while  the  growth   rate of the labour force is  expected to slowdown. The  unemployment rate is expected to exceed 7% in both  2004  and  2005.  The  worsening  of  labour  market   conditions is expected to reduce wage settlements for  the private sector of the eco nomy. The growth rate of  total  wages  per  employee  is  expected  to  decelerate   from 5½% in 2002 to about 2¼-½% on average in the  2004-2005  period,  such  that  the  trend  decline  in   price-competitiveness  looks  set  to  come  to  a  halt.  In   the   forecast   period,   households'   real   disposable    income  is  expected  to  gr owth  on  average  by  about   ½%  per  year.  This  relative  strong  pace  given  the   forecast   for   employment   a nd   real   wages,   largely    reflects the announced government policy of a phased  convergence  of  low  pensions  towards  the  minimum   wage.  Public finances  The   cumulative   loss   in   output   in   consecutive    quarters, implying a fall in real GDP for the whole of  2003, is causing substantial shortfalls in tax revenue.  In  the  first  nine  months  of  2003,  tax  revenues  in  the   state  sector  receded  by  5. 6%  year-on-year.  Against   (positive)  nominal  GDP  growth  of  around  2½%,  this   suggests  that  the  tax  system  is  very  sensitive  to   cyclical movements. Government expenditure, for its  part,  is  growing    broadly  in  line  with  targeted  for   2003.  These  revenue  and  expenditure  developments  would   lead  to  a  government  deficit  above  3%  of  GDP  in   2003.    In    order    to    prevent    it,    the    Portuguese     authorities  have  introduced  two  one-off  measures,   together worth more than 2% of GDP: i) a lump-sum  payment by the Post Office (CTT) to the government  in  exchange  of  the  transfer  to  government  of  their   unfunded   pension   obligations,   ii)   the   sale   to   a    financial  corporation  of  non-performing  tax  claims   (i.e.  tax  arrears).  Both  op erations  are  being  closely   scrutinised  by  Eurostat.  Taking  into  account  these   one-off  measures,  the  deficit  for  2003  is  forecast  to   be 2.9% of GDP.  The   budget   draft   for   2004   projects   a   general    government  deficit  of  2.8%  of  GDP.  Tax  revenue  is   estimated  to  increase  by  3. 1%,  which  compares  with   nominal  GDP  growth  of  3½%  (and  real  growth  of   1%),   while   total   current   primary   expenditure   is    planned  to  increase  by  3%,  thereby  below  nominal   GDP  growth.  The  draft  budget  for  2004  includes   one-off  measures  amounting  to  some  1.1%  of  GDP.   The  present  forecast  takes  on  board  the  full  amount   of  one-off  measures  planned  for  2004,  although  as   regards the sale of property (0.7% of GDP), a partial  realisation  of  the  sales  programme  could  be  a  more   likely outcome.    Although       the       macroeconomic       assumptions        underlying   the   Commission   forecast   differ   only    marginally  from  those  made  in  the  budget  draft,  the   Commission's general governme nt deficit forecast for  2004  is  3.3%  of  GDP,  which  is  above  the  official   budgetary target. This can basically be accounted for  by  two  factors:  carry-over  effects  from  2003  caused   by the lower tax revenue proj ected for that year in the  forecast,  combined  with   a  more  prudent  assessment   of   the   impact   on   government   accounts   of   the    reduction  in  the  corporate  profit  tax  rate  from  30  to   25%.   The  budget  forecas t  for  2004  is  con tingent  upon  the   projected decline in  the growth rate for total current  expenditure,  and  in  particular  for  the  component  of   social  transfers.  Indeed ,  the  assumed  slowdown  of   total  current  expenditure  growth  from  4.5%  in  2003   to  3.1%,  and  for  social  tran sfers  (other  than  in  kind)   from 9.0% to 5.2%, is an ambitious target.   For  2005,  the  forecast  for  the  general  government   deficit  is  based  on  legislation  currently  in  force  as   amended  by  the  draft  budget  for  2004  (the  “no- policy-change”   assumption).   The   actual   deficit   is    projected  to  be  close  to   4%  of  GDP,  reflecting  the   persistence  of  a  large  (negative)  output  gap,  and  the   fading out of the effect of one-off operations. 		
November/2003	Finland	Private consumption driving th e gradual revival of activity	Developments in 2003 Last year, Finland was one of  the very few countries in  the  EU  to  experience  a  pick -up  in  economic  activity.   Boosted  by  domestic  and  external  demand  alike,  real   GDP  rose  by  2.2%,  up  from  1.2%  in  2001.  However,   following   the   better-than-expected   performance   in    2002,  demand  and  output  receded  by  0.8%  in  the  first   quarter of 2003 from the previous period. This was due  to  a  fall  in  foreign  demand  and  a  further  decline  in   investment.  The  economy  rebounded  in  the  second   quarter  of  2003,  with  real  GDP  increasing  by  0.6%   quarter-on-quarter.   The   driving   force   behind   this    increase  were  exports,  which  climbed  by  2.5%  on  the   quarter.  Final  domestic  demand  moved  up  steadily  in   the  first  half  of  the  year,  with  private  consumption   giving    firm    support,    while    public    consumption     advanced     only     modestly.     Investment,     however,      continued  its  declining  trend,  suffering  from  weaker   final demand prospects.  The  subdued  activity  has  taken  its  toll  on  the  labour   market,  as  net  employment  creation  has  been  on  a   declining  path  recording  a  cumulative  contraction  of   0.2%  year-on-year  in  the  first  nine  months  of  2003.   Despite  the  fall  in  employment,  unemployment  has   remained fairly stable as labour supply has fallen. From  an  average  rate  of  9.1%  (s.a.)  in  2002,  unemployment   has    remained    unchanged    between    January    and     September  2003.  Inflation  (HICP)  eased  quickly  from   an average of 2.0% in 2002 to 1.2% in September 2003.  This was mainly due to lower prices of services and the  stronger euro keeping import price pressures moderate.  Prospects  Even  though  the  economy  has  returned  to  the  growth   trend,  there  are  still  downside  risks  in  the  international   economy,   which   if   realised   will   delay   a   further    recovery.  Moreover,  signs  of  lasting  economic  growth   are   confined   to   private    consumption   and   housing    investment.  Therefore,  activity  is  set  to  advance  at  a   moderate  pace  in  the  second  half  of  2003,  resulting  in   average  growth  of  about   1½%  in  2003.  Against  the   background of an assumed recovery in foreign demand  and  continued  healthy  domestic  demand,  the  economy   is  projected  to  reach  an  annual  GDP  growth  rate  of   2½% in 2004 and  2¾% in 2005.  Following  from  the  projected  profile  of  activity,  job   creation is expected to ease in the last months of 2003,  implying  a  decline  in  employment  and  a  small  rise  in   unemployment  for  the  year  as   a  whole.  For  the  future,   as   the   assumed   recovery   gradually   gathers   pace,    employment  is  projected  to  rise  slightly  in  2004  and   further in 2005.  GDP components   Private consumption is expected  to continue to drive the  economic  recovery  on  the   back  of  steady  gains  in   disposable  income  following  from  wage  increases  and   further  income  tax  cuts  in  2003  and  2004.  Public   spending  is  also  expected  to  accelerate,  based  on  the   stimulatory  measures  introduced  in  the  2004  budget   proposal. Investment activity, lacking the stimulus from  external  demand  and  suffering  from  excess  capacity,  is   projected to decline in 2003, but revive in 2004-2005.   Exports are expected to decel erate this year, but in 2004  they   should   gain   from   the   improved   international    economic   outlook   and   furt her   accelerate   in   2005.    Prospects for exports of telecommunication equipment,  but also of forest products appear somewhat promising.  However,  higher  consumer  spending  is  expected  to   raise  imports,  squeezing  the   contribution  from  external   demand to GDP growth.  Costs and prices  For  2003,  HICP  inflation  is   projected  to  average  1.4%.   In 2004, alcohol tax cuts of 33% on average will reduce  price pressures, bringing inflation further down to about %  in  2004.  In  2005,  inflation  may  rise  to  1.7%,  as   the  economy  expands  and  the  effect  of  the  tax  cut   fades  away.  In  December  2002,  a  centralised  two- year wage agreement provided for general wage rises  of  2.9%  in  2003  and  2.2%  in  2004.  Assuming  the   usual  wage  drift  of  about  1  percentage  point,  per- capita wages are expected to increase by nearly 4% in  2003  and  about  3  ½%  in  2004-05.  However,  higher   growth  in  overall  productivity  appears  likely  to  curb   the rise in unit labour costs.   Public finances  The general government financial surplus is expected  to  decrease  by  about  1  ¾  percentage  points  to  some   2½%  of  GDP  in  2003.  This  results  from  a  declining   overall  revenue  intake,  and  expansionary  measures   proposed by the new government.   Moreover, the financial position of local governments  appears  to  slip  further  into  deficit  due  to  weaker  tax   receipts  and  moderate  expe nditures  growth.  Public   sector  finances  will  stay  in  surplus  due  to  social   security  funds  surplus.  Ba sed  on  the  government’s   medium-term  spending  guidelines  of  Spring  2003   and   the   budget   proposal   for   2004,   the   general    government surplus is estimated to edge down further  to   some   1.7%   of   GDP   in   2004,   while   stronger    economic activity is expected  to bring it up to 1.9 %  in 2005.  In  2003-2005,  the  debt  ratio   is  anticipated  to  ease  to   44.3% of GDP by the end of the forecast period. 		
November/2003	Sweden	Economic growth to revive  after mild downturn  	The economy in 2003   Swedish  economic  growth  has  been  rather  subdued  so   far  in  2003,  with  GDP  growth  of  1.5%  on  the  year  in   the  first  half  of  the  year.  Exports  have  improved  after   two  years  of  very  poor  growth.  At  the  same  time,   imports  have  risen  faster,  resulting  in  a  low  growth   contribution  from  net  exports.  On  the  domestic  side,   economic activity has been mixed. Private consumption  growth    has    been    relatively    strong.    By    contrast,     investment  growth  has  been  poor,  linked  to  continued   uncertain    business    prospects.    Public    consumption     growth has been rather weak, reflecting some budgetary  constraints.   Inflation   has   come   down   considerably    during  the  year  and  as  inflationary  pressures  should   remain  subdued,  the  repo-rate  has  been  cut  twice  in   2003.  Prospects  Recent   indicators   are   mixed   and   there   is   a   clear    distinction      between      consumers      and      business       expectations.  Consumer  conf idence  indicators,  and  in   particular  consumers'  expectations  regarding  their  own   economy,  give  a  positive  picture.  The  overall  indicator   was  up  in  September  for  the  fifth  consecutive  month.   Business    confidence    indicators    are    by    contrast     substantially   less   positive   and   companies   generally    report  weak  developments  regarding  export  markets.   This   impacts   heavily   on   the   very   open   Swedish    economy.   These   prospects,   both   domestically   and    externally,  are  expected  to   result  in  relatively  subdued   GDP growth in 2003. Domestic demand growth should  be fairly stable and external demand growth should pick  up  during  2003,  resulting  in  stronger  exports.  In  2004,   economic  growth  is  expected   to  strengthen,  as  the   recovery world-wide should be  more firmly in place. In  2005,  economic  growth  is  expected  to  be  close  to  the   potential growth rate. Overall,  GDP is expected to grow  by 1.4% in 2003, 2.2% in 2004 and 2.6% in 2005.  Inflationary  pressures  are  ex pected  to  remain  subdued   over  the  forecast  period  and  inflation  should  return  to   2%  at  the  end  of  2005.  With  gradually  stronger  GDP   growth over this period, interest rates may rise slightly.  Wage  increases  are  expected  to  be  moderate  in  the   years  to  2005,  in  part  as  the  rise  in  unemployment   observed this year is not expected to be reverted during  this period.   GDP components  Despite  a  slowdown  in  disposable  income  growth  in   2003,  private  consumption  is  expected  to  continue  to   grow   steadily.   Consumer   confidence   has   improved    significantly  recently.  Financial  wealth  has  partially   recovered  from  the  long  slump  in  the  stock  markets,   with  the  recent  surge  in  e quity  prices.  House  prices   have   continued   to   rise   steadily,   contributing   to   a    relatively    strong    wealth    position    of    households.     Moreover,  the  saving  rate  of  households  reached  an   exceptionally  high  level  in  2002  -  up  by  6  percentage   points  between  2000  and  2002  -  which  provides  room   for   relatively   high   consumption   growth   over   the    forecast  period.  All  in  all,  th is  should  result  in  stable   consumption   growth   in   the   years   to   2005.   Public    consumption  is  expected  to   be  weak  over  the  forecast   period,  in  part  due  to  budgetary  constraints  at  the  local   and  central  level.  Investment  growth  is  expected  to  be   negative,   while   gradually   improving,   in   2003   as    business  prospects  remain  uncertain  and  also  due  to  a   negative  overhang  into  2003.  A  rise  in  investment  is   foreseen  for  2004  and  further  in  2005,  as  economic   activity gathers momentum and the productive capacity  needs  to  be  expanded,  following  a  period  of  falling   investment.  Swedish  exports  rises  faster  in  2003,  as   external demand growth strengthens. In 2004 and 2005,  a  further  recovery  in  exports  is  expected,  in  line  with   world markets. Imports too should continue to rise over  the forecast period, as final demand recovers gradually. Costs and prices  Inflation   has   come   down   considerably   since   the    electricity and energy  price hi ke  last winter,  reflecting  relatively  weak  economic  activity  during  this  period.   These factors should be le ss important from early 2004  onwards   and   inflationary   pressures   should   be   very    subdued.  As  demand  and  growth  revives  further  in   2005,  inflation  is  expected  to  gradually  rise  to  close  to   2%   towards   the   end   of   2005.   Wage   increases   are    expected  to  be  moderate  over  the  forecast  period.  New   wage  negotiations  foreseen  to  start  this  autumn  are   likely  to  result  in  moderate  wage  increases.  This  can   partly  be  attributed  to  some  deterioration  in  the  labour   market  in  2003,  which  is  not  expected  to  be  fully   reverted in the years to 2005.   Labour market  Employment growth has been virtually zero since 2002.  The  unemployment  rate  has  risen  in  the  first  half  of   2003,  in  part  as  a  result  of  fewer  people  engaged  in   labour  market  programmes.  The  gradual  increase  in   economic   activity   foreseen   from   2004   onwards   is    expected to create little in  the way of employment until  2005.   Public finances  In 2003, the surplus in public finances is expected to be  relatively low, mainly due to weaker economic growth.  In  2004,  overall  revenues  ar e  expected  to  rise  in  line   with  nominal  GDP.  The  expenditure-to-GDP  ratio  is   expected  to  fall  slightly,  in  part,  as  the  government   remains  committed  to  the  previously  set  expenditure   ceilings  on  central  government,  as  announced  in  the   Budget  Bill  for  2004.  In  2005,  a  higher  surplus  in  the   public  finances  is  projected  on  current  policies,  due  to   stronger  economic  activity.  The  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is   expected to fall over the forecast period and to be 50%  of GDP in 2005. 		
November/2003	United Kingdom	Robust recovery, as investme nt and net exports revive 	The economy in 2003   The  UK  economy  weathered  the  recent  global  slow- down  well.  Weakness  in  exports  and  investment  were   more than offset by strong household consumption and  general government spending.  The  Office  for  National  Statistics  revised  extensively   historical  national  accounts  da ta  due  to  methodological   improvements.  Real  GDP  growth  for  1998,  1999,  and   2000  was  revised  up,  while  for  2002  it  was  revised   down.  The  general  pattern  is  of  more  robust  growth   than previously believed.  The new numbers indicate th at recent UK GDP growth  was  more  balanced  than  previously  thought,  with  less   household  and  general  government  consumption  and   better  corporate  investment  and  exports.  Household   expenditure   nevertheless   continues   as   a   significant    driver  of  growth.  Fixed  investment  has  been  weak  but   picked up in 2003Q2. General government consumption  has  been  a  significant  contributor  to  GDP  growth.  The   significant  drag  to  growth  by  net  exports  of  goods  and   services   reflects   the   continued   weakness   in   world    demand,   but   this   effect   is   diminishing   as   external    conditions improve.  On the output side, services output slowed in Q2, while  construction    grew    strongly.    Manufacturing    output     picked  up  in  Q2,  ending  a  long  period  of  decline.   Employment    has    stayed    strong    but    this    kept     productivity   growth   (in   terms   of   output   per   head)    relatively  low.  Inflationary  pressures  have  remained   low.   RPIX   inflation   has   risen   a   little   above   the    government’s  2.5%  target,  but  it  is  well  within  the   permitted   one-percentage-point   symmetrical   margin.          HICP inflation is appreciably lower at less than 1½%.  Prospects   Growth  is  expected  to  be  around  2%  in  2003,  rising  to   2.8% and 2.9%, slightly above trend, in 2004 and 2005  respectively.  Final  demand  is  expected  to  strengthen,   with  slower  household  and  government  consumption   being  offset  by  a  pick-up  in  corporate  investment  and   net  exports.  A  negative  output  gap  of  around  1%  of   GDP  has  emerged  following  below-trend  growth  in   2002,   so   supply   constraints,   overall,   should   not    constrain growth. Unemployment is expected to remain  close to its NAIRU level of  5% throughou t the forecast  period.  Wages  should  rise  from  recent  rates  that  have   been   depressed   by   low   bonus   payments.   This   is    accompanied   by   a   pick-up    in   labour   productivity    growth,  so  growth  in  unit  labour  costs  will  remain   subdued.  Interest rates may rise slightly over the period  as growth picks up.  GDP components   Growth  in  household  consumption  is  maintained  over   the  forecast  period,  but  at  more  modest  levels.  Real   wage  earnings  are  expected  to  grow  moderately  and   disposable   incomes   continue   to   benefit   from   low    interest  rates.  Although  the  UK’s  house  price  inflation   rate  slowed  somewhat  duri ng  2003,  equity  markets  are   recovering,  and  this  is  helping  to  keep  the  household   balance  sheet  healthy  despite  recent  build-ups  in  gross   debt.   Nevertheless,   the   savings   rate   is   expected   to    increase  over  the  forecast  pe riod.  There  will  be  more   fixed   investment,   due   to   strong   planned   boosts   to    general  government  investment  and  a  better  financial   position     of     companies     with     reviving     business      expectations      and      increased      profitability.      The       importance  of  government  consumption  will  diminish,   as  would  be  expected  from  the  government’s  plans.   Export  growth  is  expected  to  recover  strongly  during   the forecast period.  Labour Market   Rises  in  wage  earnings  continue  to  be  moderate,  and   should   stay   that   way,   although   compensation   of    employees  per  head  have  been  boosted  this  year  as  a result  of  the  introduction  of  higher  employers'  national   insurance contributions in April. Employment continues  to grow moderately. Productivity growth is expected to  be improving from its low rate observed in 2002, given  the  stronger  expected  GDP   growth.  Unit  labour  costs   rises  are  expected  to  be  moderate  and  sustainable  over   the forecast period. External balance   The current account deficit is expected to diminish over  the  forecast  period.  The  negative  contribution  of  net   exports   of   goods   and   services   to   GDP   growth   is    expected  to  decline  as  UK   export  markets  show  good   growth.  Prices   HICP  inflation  was  low  at  around  1.4  %  in  August.   RPIX inflation is expected to remain within the bounds  of the government’s symmetric  2 ½ % target. The HICP  rate  is  expected  to  be  around  1½  %  throughout  the   forecast  period.  Benign  deve lopments  in  unit  labour   costs   should   continue   in   the   face   of   an   economy    operating     a     little     below     potential     and     with      unemployment close to the NAIRU.   Public finances  The  general  government  finances  recorded  a  deficit  of   1.5% of GDP in 2002. The deficit is expected to widen  further  in  2003  as  some  tax  revenues,  notably  income   and   corporation   tax,   are   weak,   while   discretionary    expenditure   growth   is   forecast   to   rise   strongly   as    planned.  It  is  assumed  that  expenditure  will  turn  out   broadly  as  projected  by  the  authorities,  in  nominal   terms.  The  Commission  is  thus  projecting  deficits  of   around 2¾% of GDP in 2003 and 2004  –  rather larger  than those projected in the Spring. A fall in the deficit is  expected  in  2005  as  the  economy  grows  strongly.  The   continuation  of  negative  output  gaps  throughout  the   forecast  period  results  in  a  cy clically  adjusted  balance   of a little more than 2% of GDP. The ratio of gross debt  to  GDP,  though  increasing  slightly,  will  be  close  to   40% by the end of 2005. 		
April/2004	Belgium	Moderate recovery ahead	The situation in 2003   After  two  years  of  economic  growth  below  1%,  the   Belgian economy staged a recovery in the second half  of  2003.  Real  GDP  is  estimated  to  have  grown  by   1.1%  in  the  whole  year,  a  figure  higher  than  those  of   the neighbouring countries. In 2003 economic growth  was  led  by  domestic  demand  whereas  the  external   contribution  was  markedly  negative,  owing  to  low   external demand and losses in competitiveness against  non-EU  countries.  Private  consumption  increased  by   1.7%  and  hence  considerably  faster  than  disposable   income,  which  rose  by  0.7%.  This  development  is   reflected  in  a  substantial  decline  in  the  households’   savings  rate  spurred  by  a  steady  improvement  in   consumer  confidence  and  possibly  some  catching-up,   after   two   years   of   quite   subdued   consumption.    Investment  recovered  from  -2.5%  in  2002  to  1.8%  in   2003,     under     the     impact     of     better     business      expectations,      improving      profit      margins      and       continuous low cost of capital. Employment fell again  last year, by 0.5%, as it has been reacting with a lag to  the  economic  downturn.  Despite  the  exchange  rate   appreciation    and    weak    final    demand,    inflation     remained  somewhat  resilient  in  the  downturn.  HICP   inflation  fell  by  only  one  decimal  point  in  2003,  to   1.5%.   Prospects for 2004 and 2005   The recovery that started in the second half of 2003 is  expected  to  strengthen  moderately  in  2004  and  2005,   ma inly driven by stronger external demand.   It is assumed that the households’ savings rate would  stabilise    in    the    forecast    period.    However,    the     significant  increase  in  real  disposable  income  would   secure  a  continued  growth  of  private  consumption  in   2004  and  2005.  The  increase  in  disposable  income,   somewhat  stronger  in  2005  than  in  2004,  is  due  to   higher  wage  increases,  the  income  tax  reform  and  a   mo re favourable employment development.   Given    the    strengthening    of    final    demand    and     historically   low   interest   rates,   investment   would    accelerate   further.   However,   the   rate   of   capacity    utilisation  is  still  relatively  low  and  the  expansion  of   investment  is  likely  to  remain  modest,  at  least  in   2004. Hence,  in  2004  and  2005  both  domestic  and  external   demand   would   contribute   to   growth   in   a   more    balanced way than in 2003.   Labour market, costs and prices   Employment   has   fallen   steadily   since   mid   2001,    leading to an increase in the unemployment rate by 2  percentage    points,    to    8.5%    in    February    2004.     Employment   should   increase   in   2004   and   more    substantially in 2005, which would result in a decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  in  2005.  This  is  due  to  the   recovery  and  is  supported  by  reductions  in  social   contributions and continued moderate wage increases.   The  latest  inter-sectoral  wage  agreement,  covering   2003  and  2004,  set  wage  cost increases  considerably   lower  than  in  previous  years.  It  has  fixed  an  upper   limit of 5.4% cumulated for both years, but given the  slack  in  the  labour  market,  the  reductions  in  social   contributions  and  lower-than-expected  inflation  this   limit  is  unlikely  to  be  reached.  In  this  context  of   relatively   modest   unit   labour   cost   increases,   the    impact  of  the  appreciation  of  the  euro,  low  interest   rates  and  the  abolition/reduction  of  the  radio  and   television  license  fees  is  expected  to  keep  inflation   low   in   2004.   The   effect   of   the   exchange   rate    appreciation should fade out in 2005, at the same time  as  unit  labour  costs  increase  faster,  the  economy   approaches  potential  output  and  the  effect  of  reduced   radio and TV fees is exhausted. All in all, this would  translate into slightly higher inflation in 2005.  Public finances  The  general  government  accounts  are  estimated  to   ha ve posted  a  surplus  of  0.2%  of  GDP  in  2003.   However,   this   surplus   was   only   possible   due   to    substantial  one-off  measures,  amounting  to  1.2%  of   GDP in net terms. For 2004, a deficit of 0.5% of GDP  is   forecast.   However,   this   figure   also   takes   into    account one-off measures of about 0.5% of GDP (the  temporary tax regulation is not included). Thus, there  is  an  underlying  (excluding  one-off  measures)  deficit   of   1%   of   GDP   in   2004,   despite   the   cyclical    improvement.   This   development   is   due   to   the    continued  impact  of  the  income  tax  reform,  reduced   social  contributions  and  a  rapid  increase  in  health   costs. These factors also have an impact on the budget  in 2005. However, thanks to a better cyclical position  and a still-lower interest expenditure, the deterioration  in   the   budget   deficit   in   2005   is   expected   to   be    contained.  A  more  pronounced  deterioration  would   however take place in terms of the cyclically adjusted  balance in 2005.   The  debt  ratio  is  projected  to  fall  this  year  and  next,   coming below 100% already in 2004. However, there  is some uncertainty in this respect as the value of the  debt   of   the   SNCB   (Railway   Company)   that   the    authorities would take over next year is still unknown  and  this  operation  has  therefore  not  been  taken  into   account.		
April/2004	Denmark	Steady recovery after zero growth 	The economy in 2003  Economic activity in Denmark stagnated in 2003, and  GDP  growth  for  the  year  as  a  whole  was  zero.  With   two  quarters  of  negative  growth  in  the  middle  of  the   year,   the   economy   was   indeed   in   a   technical    recession.  During  the  first  three  quarters  of  2003,   private  consumption  was  sluggish,  with  significant   falls  in  car  sales.  Business  investments  saw  a  sharp   downturn  in  the  second  quarter,  which  can  be  linked   to   the   geopolitical   uncertainties,   followed   by   a    rebound  in  the  third  quarter.  In  the  light  of  weak   external demand and the effective appreciation of the  krone , Danish exports were subdued.  The   fourth   quarter   brought   a   changed   picture.    Domestic demand increased vigorously, led by private  consumption  which  rose  by  1¾%  per  cent  on  the   quarter. Equipment and construction investments also  expanded  robustly,  while  software  investments  fell.   Overall, the recovery in investments in the last part of  the  year  was  insufficient  to  stop  total  investments   from falling markedly for the year as a whole. Exports  also  started  to  pick  up  in  the  fourth  quarter.  The   recovery  of  domestic  demand  in  the  fourth  quarter,   was,  however,  largely  offset  by  a  markedly  negative   growth contribution from net exports, as imports grew  strongly.  The  year  thus  ended  on  an  overall  positive   note, paving the way for an assumed improved growth  picture in 20 04 and 2005.  Prospects in 2004 and 2005   Continuing the upswing from the end of 2003, private  consumption   should   lead   domestic   demand   to   a    marked  recovery  of  economic  activity  in  2004.  A   number  of  factors  contribute  to  boosting  disposable   incomes this year, laying the ground for a recovery of  consumption:  the  full  income  tax  cuts  of  the  tax   reform,    the    suspension    of    contributions    to    a     ma ndatory  savings  scheme  and  reductions  of  excise   duties on alcohol, tobacco and soft drinks. In addition,  the  very  low  inflation  will  enhance  real  disposable   income  and  interest  rates  are  set  to  remain  low.   Against  this  background,  private  consumption,  which   has  been  subdued  for  a  number  of  years,  is  expected   to grow vigorously, in particular in 2004.   With     indust ry     confidence     indicators     pointing      upwards,  business  investments  should  continue  the   recovery  in  the  first  half  of  2004,  albeit  growing   slightly  less  than  overall  production  for  the  year  as  a   whole.  On  the  back  of  increased  overall  demand,   investment    growth    should    then    gather    strength     gradually in 2005. As  global  markets  are  set  to  expand  in  the  forecast   period,  Denmark's  exports  are  foreseen  to  recover  in   2004,  but  to  grow  less  than  export  markets,  resulting   in  a  loss  of  market  shares.  Danish  exports  of  goods   are  thus  expected  to  grow  by  some  3%  in  2004,   increasing  to  4¼%  in  2005.  Imports  are  foreseen  to   rise  somewhat  more  than  exports  in  2004  and  2005,   im plying, respectively, a slightly negative and slightly  positive contribution to GDP growth from net exports  in  the  two  years.  All  in  all,  the  recovery  of  domestic   demand  should  provide  for   a  GDP  growth  of  just   above 2% in 2004 and 2005.   Labour market, costs and prices  The labour market weakened in 2003 as GDP growth  stagnated.      Employment      fell      markedly      and       unemployment  increased  to  around  6  per  cent  of  the   labour  force.  As  the  expansion  of  economic  activity   gathers  momentum  in  2004,  employment  is  set  to   increase     again,     but     only     with     some     lag.      Unemployment  should  therefore  peak  in  the  second   half of 2004, and decline gradually over the rest of the  forecast period In a context of increasing slack on the labour market,  statutory  wage  growth  coming  out  the  private  sector   wage  negotiations  in  early  2004  point  to  a  somewhat   decelerating  wage  growth.  However,  wage  growth  is   still higher than in the euro area.  The  average  HICP  inflation  in  Denmark  in  2003  was   2%.  Towards  the  end  of  the  year,  consumer  price   inflation  decelerated  markedly  and  in  early  2004,   annual  inflation  was  below  1%.  This  development  is   ma inly due to falling import prices and energy prices.  In addition, the reduction of excise duties on alcohol,  tobacco and soft drinks in late 2003 will contribute to  lower  consumer  price  inflation  in  2004.  With  some   slack   in   the   economy,   inflation   should   overall    continue  to  be  low  in  the  forecast  period,  with  an   average   HICP   rate   of   1½%   in   2004.   However,    inflation is set to increase somewhat at the end of the  period  as  the  effects  of  falling  import  prices  and  the   cuts in excise duties disappear.  Public finances   In  spite  of  the  weak  economic  activity  in  2003,  the   general  government  balance  recorded  a  surplus  of   1½%   of   GDP.   In   2004,   the   general   government    surplus-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline somewhat.  The positive effects on revenues from increased GDP  growth are largely offset by lower tax revenues due to  the  implementation  of  the  tax  reform.  Expenditure   related to unemployment will increase for the year as  a    whole.    In    2005,    a    slightly    higher    general     government  surplus  is  foreseen  as  GDP  growth  is   somewhat stronger and public expenditure reduced as  the  situation  on  the  labour  market  improves.  The   government  gross  debt,  which  stood  at  45%  of  GDP   at the end of 2003, is set to fall to some 40% of GDP  by 2005. 		
April/2004	Germany	The economy has started to grow again 	The situation in 2003   Growth in Germany has turned mildly positive in the  second  half  to  2003,  after  a  slight  contraction  in  the   first  half  of  the  year.  Following  the  typical  pattern  of   German  recoveries,  an  acceleration  in  export  growth   provided a strong impulse likely to end the three-year- long stagnation, despite a still anaemic or even falling  final  domestic  demand.  While  private  consumption   continued   to   decline   into   the   fourth   quarter,   a    brightened outlook has led to a remarkable turnaround  in  equipment  investment,  which  after  falling  by  one- fifth over the last three years started heading up again.   The  end-of-year  pick-up  was,  however,  too  weak  for   overall GDP growth to resume in 2003. It edged down  by  0.1%,  as  a  result  of  a  sizable  decline  in  both  final   domestic  demand  and  net  exports  that  was  largely   offset by a strong contribution from stocks.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005  Despite the negative overall growth in 2003, the year  witnessed  a  number  of  changes  that  justify  a  more   optimistic   outlook   for   2004.   Germany’s   exports    benefit strongly from an accelerating world economy.  Export demand has so far not been visibly dampened  by the strong euro. Economic sentiment indicators, as  well  as  the  stock  market,  reflect  a  significantly  more   pos itive  outlook  than  several  months  ago,  although   expectations  have  recently  been  toned  down  to  fall   closer in line with the present situation.     On  this  basis,  a  gradual  recovery  should  take  hold   over   the   next   two   years.   Growth   will   gather    mo me ntum only gradually, as constraints start to ease.  GDP growth is projected at 1.5% in 2004 and 1.8% in  2005.    These    figures    understate    the    expected     acceleration,  because  the  profile  is  dominated  by  a   positive  calendar  effect  of  ½  percentage  point  in  the   current  leap  year,  which  will  be  partly  reversed  next   year. At least initially, strong export demand should be the  ma in  driver,  as  order  volumes  for  investment  goods   rose  strongly.  It  is  to  be  expected,  however,  that  the   strong euro will dampen export demand starting from  the middle of the year. After that, export growth may  be outstripped by imports, as an accelerating domestic  demand replaces the external contribution as the main  source of growth.   Domestic demand growth is likely to be broad-based.  Equipment  investment,  which  in  recent  years  was   largely   confined   to   replacement,   is   picking   up    strongly    and    even    the    notoriously    depressed     construction   sector   will   benefit   somewhat   from    activity  carried  forward  in  anticipation  of  a  subsidy   being phased out.  Private consumption is also expected to resume, after  bleak economic prospects led households to hold back  spending    even    beyond    the    stagnation    in    real     disposable  income.  The  income  tax  reductions  in   January  2004  and  2005,  rising  consumer  confidence   and a sizable pent-up demand should be conducive to  the   expected   turn-around   in   consumption.   While    reforms in the labour market, pensions and the health  care  sector  might  dampen  the  drive  for  consumption,   such  reforms  should  nevertheless  prove  crucial  in   supporting  the  economic  upswing,  as  they  increase   industrial  confidence,  lower  the  social  contribution   burden  and  increase  flexibility  in  an  anaemic  labour   market. Labour market, costs and prices  Already,  labour  market  reforms  have  led  to  a  sizable   creation of mini-jobs and will become more effective  as the economy picks up momentum. The creation of  a low wage sector should also have positive spill-over  effects on the rest of the economy. Related to this and  to  the  high  level  of  unemployment,  the  increase  in   effective  wages  will  continue  to  be  moderate  and  in   line      with      productivity      increases.      Domestic       inflationary  pressure  will  therefore  be  very  low,  and   Germany     would     continue     to     gain     in     price      competitiveness    vis-à-vis    its    European    trading     partners.  This,  together  with  a  drop  in  import  prices,   should  keep  headline  inflation  below  1%  annually   were  it  not  for  special  factors  like  the  impact  of  the   health care reform and increases in tobacco taxes.    Public finances  In 2003 the general government deficit widened from  3.5%  to  3.9%  of  GDP,  mainly  due  to  growth  turning   out lower than expected. This was countered to some  extent  by  consolidation  measures  introduced  in  2003.   In particular, social security contributions were raised  and benefits to public sector employees were cut.   Legislation  adopted  in  1999  and  2000  committed   Germany  to  several  steps  of  income  tax  relief  until   2005.  The  two  steps  taking  effect  in  2004  and  2005   will be partly counter-financed by a broadening of the  tax base.  Wi th in    the    reform    programme    “Agenda    2010”     designed  by  the  German  government  and  following   the   negotiations   of   the   parliamentary   Mediation    Committee,  a  package  of  consolidation  measures  for   the social transfer systems as well as cuts in subsidies  and  other  transfers  to  households  were  passed  into   law   in   2003.   As   their   implementation   will   be    continuing  into  2005,  the  government  expenditure   share is predicted to be falling in 2004 and 2005.  Budgetary  risks  in  2004  mainly  derive  from  some   one-time measures such as the tax amnesty that might  be  less  successful  than  planned,  the  postponed  road   toll  for  lorries  and  an  unexpectedly  low  Bundesbank   profit.  The  budgetary  risks  for  2005  result  mainly   from  growth  possibly  being  lower  than  expected  by   the   German   authorities.   In   2004,   the   deficit   will    continue  to  be  well  above  3%  of  GDP.  In  2005,  the   deficit is expected to fall below the reference value by  a   small   margin.   If   growth   turns   out   lower   than    forecast  or  if  the  structural  measures  do  not  have  the   expected  budgetary  effects,  Germany  clearly  risks   breaching,  on  unchanged  policies,  the  3%  of  GDP   ceiling once more. 		
April/2004	Greece	Despite strong growth, progress in fiscal consolidation is postponed 	Economic activity in 2003   The  economy  continued  to  be  buoyant  in  2003,  with   real  GDP  growth  estimated  at  4.2%.  Growth  was   driven  by  domestic  demand,  in  particular  investment   in  construction,  linked  to  the  preparation  of  the  2004   Olympic  Games  and  assisted by  financial  flows  from   the   EU   Structural   Funds.   Private   consumption,    buttressed   by   easy   monetary   conditions   and   an    improvement  in  disposable  income,  has  also  been  a   significant  contributor  to  GDP  growth.  Owing  to  a   sharp  acceleration  of  imports,  the  current  account   deficit   appears   to   have   widened   further   in   2003,    although export activity has started to recover.   The unemployment rate, still among the highest in the  EU,   was   slightly   reduced   as   employment   growth    started  to  respond  to  booming  economic  activity  in   recent quarters. Compensation per head slowed down  partly  due  to  the  implementation  of  the  2002  wage   agreement     in     the     private     sector.     Inflation      developments in 2003 point to the non-tradable sector  and  weather-related  price  increases  in  unprocessed   food as the main sources of price pressures. Consumer  prices growth averaged 3.5% in the year.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005   The  economy  is  expected  to  continue  to  grow  at  fast   rates   in   2004   while   a   deceleration   in   economic    activity  is  projected  for  2005.  The  main  factors  that   will  contribute  to  growth  in  2004  are  still  strong   domestic  demand  and  the  recovery  of  the  European   economy.  Private  consumption,  supported  by  easy   m onetary  conditions,  is  expected  to  continue  to  grow   at a sustained pace to the forecast horizon, as a result  of  an  increase  in  disposable  income  due  to  the  2002   tax  reforms  and  the  2003  social  package.  Investment   should  continue  to  increase,  albeit  at  a  slower  rate   than   in   2003,   as   investment   associated   with   the    Olympic  Games  will  still  be  realized  in  the  first  half   of  2004.  However,  the  expected  improvement  of  the   international  environment  from  2004,  the  assumed   low  interest  rates  and  continued  financial  flows  from   the   EU   Structural   Funds   may   help   in   keeping    economic  activity  relatively  buoyant  throughout  the   forecasting period.  The  current  account  deficit  is  expected  to  narrow   temporarily   in   2004   as   exports,   in   particular   of    services, are expected to increase considerably due to  the  international  economic  recovery  and  the  Olympic   Games. On the other hand, imports should slow down  due    to    a    relative    deceleration    of    investment.     Nonetheless,   private   consumption   is   expected   to    continue  to  be  sustained  by  positive  increases  in   disposable  income  and  low  interest  rates,  implying   strong   import   growth   throughout   the   forecasting    period.  As  a  result,  the  negative  contribution  of  the   external  balance  should  narrow  in  2004  but  increase   again  in  2005,  due  to  underlying  macroeconomic   imbalances and competitiveness losses.  Costs and prices   Consumer  prices  are  expected  to  rise  at  a  fast  pace,   with  consumer  price  inflation  (national  definition)   averaging marginally below 3.5% until the end of the  forecasting period. While the contribution of imported  inflation should remain small, wage developments are  quite   uncertain,   as   the   negotiations   for   the   new    collective   wage   agreement   have   just   started.   The    generous  wage  increases  in  the  public  sector  may   adversely   affect   the   outcome   of   the   negotiations.    Finally,  the  output  gap,  albeit  narrowing,  is  expected   to remain positive.  Public finances   Despite strong growth, the situation of public finances  worsened considerably as implementation of the 2003  State budget was completely off track.  Although  partly  attributable  to  some  extraordinary   factors   (the   preparation   of   the   Olympic   Games,    compensation  for  weather  damage),  the  overshooting   compared  with  the  budget  target  suggests  a  lack  of   control  over  primary  spending  (social  transfers  and   public  sector  wages)  while  budget  revenues  also  fell   short of projections.      The    estimated    budgetary    outcome    in    2003    is     characterised   by   great   uncertainty,   with   obvious    im p lications   for   the   making   of   2004   budgetary    projections.  In  a  first  EDP  notification  (1  March   2004),  the  general  government  deficit  in  2003  was   estimated at 1.7% of GDP against a target of 0.9% of  GDP. Eurostat considered the data as provisional and  subject to revision, due to ongoing discussion with the  authorities  in  Greece.  According  to  a  second  EDP   notification   (30   March),   the   general   government    deficit  was  revised  upwards  to  3%;  the  new  figures   are   being   scrutinised   by   Eurostat   and   not   yet    validated.  The  Commission  forecast  is  built  on  this   latest  estimate  of  the  2003  deficit  communicated  by   the  Greek  authorities,  although  by  no  means  does  it   represent a validation of this deficit figure.   Under the usual assumption of unchanged policy, the  Commission  forecasts  a  further  deterioration  in  the   budgetary position of the general government in 2004.  This  is  due,  first,  to  the  significant  base-year  effects   for  2004  from  the  higher  deficit  in  2003;  second,  to   the  impact  of  the  2003  social  package  (estimated  at   over 1% of GDP for 2004), which seems to have been  understated   in   the   expenditure   projections;   and    finally,  to  the  lower  than  officially  projected  growth   in  tax  revenues,  given  the  recent  tax  reforms.  A   ma rginal improvement is expected in 2005, assuming  that    some    primary    expenditure    related    to    the     preparation   of   the   Olympic   Games   will   not   be    recurring   in   2005.   The   primary   surplus   should    continue  to  shrink  in  2004  while  the  debt  ratio  is   expected  to  decline,  albeit  at  a  slow  pace,  given  the   still  high  stock-flow  adjustments  and  debt-increasing   financial transactions. 		
April/2004	Spain	Growth gains momentum in 2004	Economic developments in 2003  In  2003,  real  GDP  grew  by  2.4%,  marginally  above   the  Commission’s  autumn  forecast.  The  main  forces   driving  economic  activity  were  private  consumption   and investment in dwellings, while the external sector  posted  a  negative  contribution  to  GDP  growth  of  1   percentage  point.  Growth  was  noticeably  firm  in  the   final  quarter  due  to  buoyant  private  consumption  and   a less negative external contribution, which involves a  sizeable   carry-over   effect   for   2004.   In   contrast,    investment in equipment remained almost flat.   Prospects for 2004 and 2005  A slight deceleration on a quarterly basis is envisaged  for  the  first  quarter  of  2004.  Confidence  indicators   remain mixed and industrial production fell sharply at  the   beginning   of   the   year.   On   the   other   hand,    mo rtgage  borrowing  is  accelerating.  From  the  third   quarter  onwards,  final  demand  is  envisaged  to  gain   dynamism,  mainly  due  to  growth  of  investment  in   equipment and of exports.   In 2004 as a whole, private consumption is envisaged  to  remain  robust.  Sound  employment  growth  and   residual  impulses  from  the  personal  income  tax  cut   implemented  in  2003  coupled  with  lower  inflation   rates  will  sustain  consumption  while  still  allowing  a   rise   in   the   saving   ratio.   The   latter   should   help    strengthen  the  financial  position  of  households  after   the  growing  indebtedness  registered  in  recent  years,   and   inhibit   a   further   acceleration   of   consumer    spending.  These  trends  are  expected  to  persist  in   2005.provided     the     envisaged     wage     moderation     is      confirmed.   Thus,   compensation   per   head   should    decelerate  in  2004  and  2005,  supported  by  a  much   lower  impact  of  wage  indexation  clauses.  This  wage   m oderation  coupled  with  a  rise  in  apparent  labour   productivity  should  imply  decelerating  unit  labour   costs in the projection period.   External sector  The current account deficit is forecast to widen further  in  2004  and  2005.  This  deterioration  stems  mainly   from the growing trade deficit, only partially offset by  the  services  balance  surplus. The  trade  deficit  in  turn   reflects  relatively  higher  domestic  demand  growth   than   in   export   markets,   combined   with   ongoing    worsening in cost competitiveness.  Public finances  In 2003, despite personal income tax cuts, the general  government   balance   achieved   a   better   result   than    expected,  registering  a  surplus  of  0.3%  of  GDP.  The   fiscal  forecast,  particularly  that  for  2005,  is  clearly   subject to policy changes that could be announced by  the  new  government  that  gained  office  following  the   March 2003 general election. On the basis of policies  as  announced  by  the  outgoing  government,  in  2004   indirect  taxes  and  social  security  contributions  are   expected  to  remain  buoyant,  supported  by  strong  job   creation,  while  growth  of  direct  tax  revenue  should   regain some strength after the tax reform implemented  in   2003,   with   corporate   tax   revenue   expected   to    respond   to   firms’   higher   profits.   These   elements    together  with  moderate  growth  of  expenditure  items   should  enable  the  general  government  to  register  a   surplus  of  0.4%  of  GDP.  In  2005  the  government   budget balance is foreseen to show a surplus of 0.6%  of   GDP.   The   debt-to-GDP   ratio   is   expected   to    continue  to  decline  during  the  forecasting  period,   falling to around 45% of GDP by end-2005.   Based  on  a  more  positive  international  outlook  and   better  business  prospects,  investment  is  foreseen  to   gain  dynamism  in  2004  and  2005,  mainly  due  to   stronger  investment  in  equipment  linked  to  a  great   extent  to  accelerating  exports,  which  should  more   than  offset  the  moderation  envisaged  for  dwellings.   The  relatively  healthy  financial  position  of  firms  and   rising  profitability  should  help  foster  a  recovery  of   investment  in  equipment.  On  the  other  hand,  the   forecast  deceleration  of  construction  is  based  on  two   elements,  namely  the  weaker  financial  position  of   households  deterring  residential  investment  and  less   dynamic  public  investment  linked  to  the  electoral   cycle. The external sector is set to recover vigour during the  forecast    period    stemming    from    the    envisaged     recovery   of   Spain’s   main   trading   partners.   Both    exports and imports are expected to accelerate, which  should entail a more moderate drag from the external  sector. As   result,   output   growth   is   expected   to   gain    dynamism  and  further  accelerate  to  2.8%  in  2004,   accelerating  slightly  from  the  second  quarter  of  the   y ear in quarterly terms. Based on higher investment in  equipment  and  exports  of  goods  and  services,  real   GDP in 2005 is forecast to accelerate at the end of the  year  and  grow  by  3.3%  on  average,  slightly  above   poten tial. Labour market  Following   the   economic   upturn   throughout   the    forecasting  period,  employment  creation  should  grow   above 2% in terms of full-time equivalent jobs in both  2004   and   2005.   Notwithstanding   the   envisaged    increase  in  the  active  population,  strong  employment   creation  should  help  reduce  unemployment  to  rates   below    11 .0%    and    10.5%    in    2004    and    2005,     respectively (EUROSTAT definition).  Costs and prices  Both  headline  and  core  inflation  are  expected  to   m oderate significantly in the first quarter of 2004 and  pick-up    slightly    thereafter.    On    average,    HICP     inflation is expected to ease to 2.4% in 2004 (3.1% in  2003)  and  to  fall  marginally further  to  2.3%  in  2005, 		
April/2004	France	The recovery is under way 	The economic situation in 2003   Wi th an  increase  of  0.2%,  real  GDP  experienced  in   2003  its  worst  performance  since  the  1993  recession   (-0.9%).  The  slowdown  in  economic  activity  was   primarily   due   to   the   sharp   deterioration   of   the    contribution  of  net  exports  to  growth.  However,  the   low  growth  figure  hides  a  highly  contrasted  profile   within 2003. After having skirted the recession in the  first  half  of  2003,  the  French  economy  picked  up  in   the  second  half  of  the  year,  when  growth  reached  an   annualised  rate  of  about  2%.  This  acceleration  was   driven  by  a  rebound  in  exports,  after  one  year  of   continuous  decline,  and  a  pick  up  in  demand  from   firms. In particular, private companies increased their  investment flow for the first time in two years.   Prospects for 2004 and 2005  Recent  business  surveys  confirm  that  a  recovery  is   under way. In particular, business sentiment improved  markedly  in  the  service  and  the  building  sectors  in   recent     months.     In     the     manufacturing     sector,      expectations   are   also   oriented   upward,   but   their    improvement  seems  more  hesitant.  In  contrast  with   developments    of    business    sentiment,    consumer     confidence has remained very low. French consumers  are  in  particular  concerned  by  developments  in  the   labour market. All in all, developments in surveys are  consistent   with   growth   stabilising   at   a   close   to    potential rate in the next few months.  On the back of the assumed improvement in the world  economy  and  favourable  monetary  conditions,  the   recovery of economic activity in France is expected to  develop  further  in  2004  and  2005.  Real  GDP  growth   would  resume  to  an  above  potential  rate  from  next   summer  onwards  with  annual  rates  reaching  1.7%  in   2004 and 2.4% in 2005.  The acceleration of exports would continue to support  an    upturn    in    demand    expectations,    and    lead     companies    to    reverse    the    ongoing    de-stocking     m ovement.   In   addition,   equipment   investment   is    expected  to  accelerate  gradually.  This  development   would   also   be   supported   by   favourable   financing    conditions,  reflecting  the  low  level  of  interest  rates,   and by the introduction of tax incentives (abolition of  the taxe  professionnelle on  new  capital  expenditure).   The need for companies to adjust their balance sheets  will  however  moderate  the  pick  up  in  investment   growth in the next few quarters.   The  recovery  of  private  consumption  would  be  more   gradual.  Indeed,  the  increase  in  real  gross  disposal   income of households is projected to remain subdued  in  2004,  before  accelerating  significantly  in  2005  in   line  with  a  rebound  in  employment.  The  saving  ratio   of households  is  projected  to  edge  down  slightly  in   the next two years.   Labour markets, costs and prices   The  past  deterioration  of  economic  activity  is  still   impacting  on  the  labour  market:  employment  growth   remains  weak  and  it  is  not  expected  to  accelerate   significantly   before   next   summer.   The   need   for    companies   to   restore   their   profit   margins   will    probably   delay   the   recovery   in   employment.   The    cyclical  acceleration  of  productivity  would  therefore   be particularly pronounced in 2004.  Wage  moderation  is  projected  to  continue  in  2004.   This  year,  the  impact  of  the  harmonisation  of  the   different  levels  of  minimum  wage  created  by  the   working time reduction laws will be counter-balanced  by   a   cyclical   deceleration   in   wages.   A   slight    acceleration   in   real   wages   would   occur   in   2005,    driven by the decline in the unemployment rate.  As  a  consequence  of  the  moderation  in  unit  labour   costs   expected   for   2004   and   2005,   underlying    inflationary    pressures    are    projected    to    remain     subdued.  The  profile  of  consumer  price  inflation  will   however  be  strongly  influenced  by  fluctuations  in   tobacco   prices,   which   will   increase   the   annual    inflation rate by 0.5 percentage point in 2004, and by  0.1 percentage point in 2005.  Public finances   In   2003,   the   situation   of   French   public   finances    deteriorated  markedly,  mainly  due  to  growth  turning   out  lower  than  expected.  The  general  government   deficit  increased  from  3.2%  of  GDP  in  2002  to  4.1%   of GDP in 2003. Due to the increase in the deficit, but  also  to  low  growth  in  nominal  GDP  and  to  debt- increasing  stock-flow  adjustments  amounting  to  1.3   percentage  points  of  GDP,  the  general  government   gross debt-to-GDP ratio rose by 4.4 percentage points  in 2003 to 63.0 percent of GDP.   In 2004, the general government deficit is projected to  decline  from  4.1%  of  GDP  to  3.7%  of  GDP.  This   decline  will  be  hampered  by  the  lagged  impact  on   fiscal  revenues  of  the  low  2003  real  GDP  growth.  In   this  forecast,  it  is  assumed  that  expenditure  plans   included   in   the   Finance   Law   for   2004   will   be    respected,     except     for     a     slippage     in     health      expenditures.   On   the   revenue   side,   the   forecast    incorporates  discretionary  tax  increases  amounting  to   0.15   percentage   point   of   GDP.   Based   on   the    commonly  agreed  methodology  for  the  calculation  of   potential  output,  this  forecast  is  consistent  with  a   decline  in  the  cyclically-adjusted  deficit  by  about  0.5   percentage point of GDP in 2004.   In 2005, the general government deficit is projected to  decrease   only   marginally   to   3.6%   of   GDP.   Real    general   government   expend iture   is   projected   to    increase  by  2.2%  in  real  terms  in  2005,  in  line  with   the trend observed in the last five years. This forecast  does  not  incorporate  the  potential  positive  impact  of   the  reform  of  the  health  insurance  system  that  is   currently being designed.  		
April/2004	Ireland	A broad-based recovery is under way	Activity in 2003   In line with preliminary national accounts for the first  three  quarters,  real  GDP  growth  is  estimated  to  have   averaged  just  above  1%  in  year  2003,  representing  a   marked  slowdown  on  2002  (6.9%)  and  2001  (6.2%).   Consumption  growth  remained  relatively  healthy  but   there   was   a   pronounced   fall   in   all   categories   of    investment  bar  housing.  Overall  domestic  demand   was  therefore  quite  subdued.  The  dramatic  drop  in   both  exports  and  imports  must  be  qualified  as  there   was a very marked fall-off in merchandise trade with  the  UK,  assumed  to  be  related  to  the  termination  of   UK-based VAT fraud schemes in the course of 2002.  The  external  side  is  estimated  to  have  made  a  fairly   weak  contribution  to  overall  growth  compared  to   previous years.  Growth  in  real  GNI  terms  seems  to  have  been  much   mo re  buoyant  in  2003  than  in  real  GDP  terms,  on   account  of  a  decline  in  net  factor  outflows.  This  is   exactly  the  opposite  of  the  pattern  observed  in  2002,   when   real   GDP   growth   pointed   to   a   remarkable    expansion  (concentrated  in  the  chemicals  sector)  in   spite of the worldwide slowdown.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005  The  Irish  economy  is  expected  to  post  a  broad-based   recovery over the forecast horizon. Real GDP growth  is  projected  to  reach  3.7%  in  2004  and  to  strengthen   to  4.6%  in  2005,  close  to  the  rate  commonly  thought   to be sustainable in the medium term, of up to 5%.   On    the    domestic    side,    private    consumption    is     expected  to  benefit  from  nominal  disposable  income   gains (albeit more moderate than in recent years) and  a  lower  inflation  rate  than  in  the  recent  past.  The   contribution  from  public  consumption  should  remain   m odest  in  view  of  further  spending  restraint  and  the   envisaged     cut     in     public     sector     employment.      Investment  in  equipment  should  pick  up  in  line  with   the  general  recovery,  while  construction  is  supported   by   significant   public   capital   spending   under   the    National  Development  Plan  after  a  pause  in  2003.   However,  growth  in  housing  completions  is  expected   to taper off after double-digit growth in 2003.  Building   on   the   regained   momentum   of   the   last    m onths of 2003, merchandise exports are expected to  stage  a  strong  recovery  in  line  with  the  international   upturn.  External trade in services is also projected to  return to the more dynamic growth rates of the period  before 2003.  Labour market  The  labour  market  was  remarkably  resilient  in  2003   with  a  slight  rise  in  the  unemployment  rate  to  4.6%   from 4.3% in 2002. Employment is estimated to have  grown  1¾%  but  about  two-thirds  of  the  net  gains  are   accounted  for  by  the  public  sector.  In  view  of  the   aforementioned  cut  in  public  sector  employment,  this   will  not  be  repeated  over  the  forecast  period.  As  a   result, employment gains will be quite weak in 2004,  while  unemployment  is  projected  to  rise  to  some  5%   before easing slightly the year after.  Costs and prices  The  available  data  for  the  first  three  quarters  of  2003   suggest  that  there  has  been  no  further  moderation  of   per  capita  compensation  growth  since  about  mid- 2 002,  when  it  broadly  halved  compared  to  a  year   earlier.  Average  income  growth  is  thus  estimated  at   around  5%  on  the  year  in  2003  and  a  similar  rate  is   projected for 2004. Some further easing in the private  sector in view of moderating inflationary pressures is  expected to be partly offset by strong wage growth in  the public sector given the gradual implementation of  “benchmarking” (upward adjustments to public sector  pay scales based on comparison with rates for similar  jobs in the private sector).  52 Chapter 3  Member States, Ireland HICP  inflation  averaged  4.0%  in  2003,  down  from   4.7%  in  2002.  With  downward  pressures  stemming   from   weak   activity   and   a   stronger   currency,   the    annual  rate  eased  significantly  through  2003,  from   4.7% in January to 2.9% in December. HICP inflation  averaged 2.3% in the first two months of 2004 and is  projected to trough in the third quarter before picking  up  in  response  to  strengthening  economic  activity.   HICP  inflation  is  thus  forecast  to  average  2.1%  in   2004  and  2.3%  in  2005.  This  would  considerably   narrow the positive inflation differential with the euro  area. Public finances  The  main  measures  in  the  budget  for  2004  are  a   further   reduction   of   the   growth   rate   of   current    discretionary   expenditure   (to   7.5%   from   9.5%   in    2003),  a  return  to  positive  growth  in  discretionary   capital  spending  after  the  cut  in  2003  and,  on  the   revenue  side,  a  modest  hike  in  indirect  taxes  and  a   partial  adjustment  to  inflation  of  the  personal  income   tax  system.  The  deficit  is  forecast  to  reach  around   0.8%  of  GDP,  somewhat  better  than  planned  by  the   authorities  (1.1%),  and  to  widen  to  1.0%  in  2005.   Given  the  non-indexed  nature  of  the  tax  and  social   benefit  systems,  the  no-policy  change  assumption  for   2005 is made operational, in the absence of previously  announced  measures,  by  freezing  average  tax  rates   and adjusting social transfer payments by the forecast  CPI  inflation  rate  (with  a  small  top-up).  Government   debt is projected to stabilise at one-third of GDP. 		
April/2004	Italy	Moderate recovery taking shape in 2004 	The situation in 2003   Following   a   strong   rebound   in   the   third   quarter    economic   growth   declined   marginally   in   the   last    quarter  of  20 03.  This  was  in  contrast  with  ongoing   quarterly growth in the other large EU economies and  can  partly  be  explained  by  a  general  strike  held  in   October.   In   2003   as   a   whole   growth   was   0.3%,    marginally below the euro area average. The negative  impact  from  the  external  side  more  than  halved  the   positive contribution from domestic demand.  Prospects in 2004 and 2005   The recovery in 2004 is expected to be mainly driven  by   domestic   demand,   which   should   benefit   from    positive  fundamentals.  Private  consumption  is  likely   to  recover  from  the  negative  reading  in  Q4-2003  in   view of moderate yet positive job creation, real wage  increases,   rising   housing   prices   and   an   ongoing    recovery  of  stock  markets.  After  the  contraction  in   2003  triggered  by  the  expiry  of  an  important  tax   incentive at the end of 2002, investment is expected to  gain strength, benefiting from low interest rates, rising  profit margins and the improving growth outlook. The  external  side  is  likely  to  continue  to  act  as  a  drag  on   economic growth, yet to a lesser extent than in 2003.  Overall, real GDP is forecast to rise by 1.2% in 2004  as  a  whole,  around  ½  a  percentage  point  less  than  in   the euro area average. An acceleration to around 2.1%  is  projected  in  2005,  again  mainly  sustained  by  firm   domestic demand coupled with an improving yet still  marginally  negative  contribution  from  the  external   Labour market, costs and prices  Wi th a  significant  lag  compared  to  the  slowdown  in   economic  activity,  job  creation  came  to  a  halt  in  the   second  half  of  2003.  However,  thanks  to  the  strong   performance recorded in 2002 and the increase in the  first half of 2003 employment was up 1% in the year  as  a  whole.  The  rate  of  unemployment  fell  to  8.7%,   closing the gap with the euro area average after more  than 10 years.   Wi th the  economic  recovery  taking  hold  in  2004,   employment is expected to pick up gradually over the  year.  The  number  of  full-time  equivalents  is  forecast   to  rise  by  0.3%,  slightly  less  than  the  employment   headcount  due  to  the  impact  of  part-timers,  the  legal   basis  of  which  was  further  liberalised  by  the  ‘Biagi’   law at the end of 2003. Following the recent period of  ‘growth-less  job  creation’  ensuing  from  successive   steps  of  labour  market  reform  since  the  mid-1990s,   the  job  content  of  growth  is  projected  to  gradually   return  to  lower  levels  in  the  medium  term.  In  2005   em ployment   (full-time   equivalents)   is   forecast   to    increase   by   0.7%.   The   rate   of   unemployment   is    expected to continue its downward trend.  HICP  inflation,  which  averaged  2.8%  in  2003,  has   eased  on  the  year  at  the  beginning  of  2004.  Falling   import  prices,  a  sizeable  negative  output  gap  and   ongoing    wage    moderation    are    expected    to    be     conducive     to     declining     inflationary     pressures      throughout  the  year.  Annual  inflation  is  forecast  to   average  somewhat  above  2%  in  2004  and  to  stay   below    that    threshold    in 2005.    The    inflation     differential vis-à-vis the euro area average is projected  to narrow gradually.   Public finances  In  2003,  the  general  government  deficit  was  broadly   unchanged  compared  to  the  previous  year,  bolstered   by hefty inflows from a tax amnesty, which improved  the  budgetary  outturn  by  around  1.5%  of  GDP.  In   total,  the  one-off  improvement  brought  about  by  a   series  of  measures  implemented  in  2003  is  estimated   to  have  been  slightly  more  than  2%  of  GDP,  about   half  a  percentage  point  above  the  impact  recorded  in   2002. Nevertheless, the erosion of the primary surplus  since  2001  continued.  Interest  expenditure  was  half  a   percentage  point  of  GDP  lower  than  the  previous   year. The  government  debt  ratio  fell  to  106.2%  of  GDP   from    108.0%    in    2002,    thanks    to    privatisation     operations carried out at the end of the year in parallel  with  the  transformation  of   Ca ssa  Depositi  e  Prestiti   (the  savings  and  loans  bank  formerly  part  of  the   general government) into a joint-stock company and a  reduction  in  the  deposits  held with  the  Bank  of  Italy.   In  2004,  in  the  absence  of  supplementary  measures,   the    forecast    general    government    deficit    would     increase  to  3.2%  of  GDP.  The  impact  of  temporary   measures  is  expected  to  halve  compared  to  2003.   Wi th short-term  interest  rates  slightly  lower  than  in   2003  and  some  gains  from  refinancing  older  higher- rate   bonds   with   new   issues,   interest   expenditure    would  continue  to  edge   down  relative  to  GDP.  The   primary surplus would further deteriorate, nearing the  averages  recorded  at  the  beginning  of  the  1990s.   Cyclically adjusted, the budget deficit and the primary  surplus would both deteriorate markedly.  The Commission forecast is aligned with the officially  estimated  budgetary  impact  of  a  number  of  measures   in  the  Budget  Law  for  2004  and  related  legislation.   This  includes  tax  settlements  and  amnesties  with  a   total  impact  of  0.6  percentage  point  of  GDP.  Unlike   the   official   projections,   sales   of   real   estate   are    assumed to yield 0.5% of GDP (compared to 0.7% of  GDP). Moreover, the rate of increase of compensation  of  employees  is  based  on  the  observation  that  part  of   the increases from the new wage settlements foreseen  for  2003  has  slid  to  2004.  Finally,  ANAS,  the  joint- stock    company    in    charge    of    investment    and     maintenance of the state road network, is prudentially  assumed to remain part of the general government.  The  forecast  for  2005,  a  deficit  of  4%  of  GDP,  is   based  on  legislation  currently  in  force.  Sales  of  real   assets are assumed to be considerably lower compared  to  2004.  Capital  receipts  reflect  the  expiration  of  all   one-off revenue measures.   The  debt  ratio  is  expected  to  decline  marginally  in   2004  and  to  stabilise  in  2005.  Privatisation  receipts   are  around  1  percentage  point  of  GDP  each  year,  as   indicated   in   the   stability   programme   update   of    December 2003. 		
April/2004	Luxembourg	Turning the corner 	The situation in 2003   Economic  activity  in  2003  was  subdued  for  the  third   year  in  a  row,  as  Luxembourg  is  recovering  only   slowly   from   the   negative   impact   of   the   global    slowdown   and   the   turmoil   on   financial   markets.    However,  available  data  point  to  a  recovery  from  the   third quarter onwards. Industrial production was quite  dynamic,  and  increased  by  2.6%  for  the  year  as  a   whole.    The    trade    balance    showed    a    strong     improvement in the last two quarters of the year. Real  GDP  growth  is  estimated  to  have  reached  1.8%  in   2003.  The  labour  market  deteriorated,  in  a  lagged   response  to  the  economic  slowdown.  Whereas  labour   shedding    took    place    in    some    sectors,    notably     ma nufacturing     and     financial     services,     overall      employment growth held up rather well at around 2%.  This,  in  turn,  implied  that  overall  labour  productivity   growth   remained   negative   for   the   third   year   in    succession.    Despite    the    continued    growth    in     employment,  the  unemployment  rate  increased,  to   slightly  above  4%  at  the  end  of  the  year.  The  broad   unemployment figure, counting also people in specific  employment schemes, was even higher. However, the  increase  in  the  unemployment  rate  peaked  in  the   summer  of  2003  and  unemployment  has  increased   less  rapidly  afterwards.  While  compensation  growth   decelerated    somewhat,    HICP    inflation    remained     broadly stable at around 2.5%. First estimates indicate  that   the   general   government   balance   deteriorated    considerably, from a surplus of 2.7% of GDP in 2002  to  a  very  small  deficit  of  0.1%  of  GDP  in  2003.  The   deterioration    was    cushioned    somewhat    by    the     collection of back taxes and some special factors with  a positive impact on VAT receipts.   Prospects for 2004 and 2005   Real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  increase  over  the   projection    horizon,    in    line    with    the    expected     improvement in economic conditions in the euro area.  Economic growth should gradually pick up to slightly  above  3%  in  2005,  which  is  still  well  below  the   average  growth  rates  witnessed  in  the  1980s  and   1990s. The modest upturn in 2004 would be primarily  due  to  stronger  domestic  demand,  with  investment   improving  in  response  to  more  favourable  external   conditions.  The  financial  sector,  which  accounts  for   around half of the exports from the Grand Duchy, was  a  drag  on  growth  in  the  downturn  but  medium-term   prospects  in  this  sector  should  be  more  favourable.   Consequently,  net  exports  would  be  higher  in  2005.   Private consumption growth is expected to strengthen  somewhat,   in   line   with   the   development   of   real    compensation     per     employee     and     a     gradual      improvement    in    employment.    Nevertheless,    the     economic  upturn  would  still  have  only  a  limited   positive effect on unemployment. The unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  increase  from  3.7%  on  average  in   2003 to 4.7% in 2004. Unemployment would continue  rising somewhat in the course of 2005.   Underlying   inflation   is   projected   to   decrease,   in    response  to  weak  import  prices,  relatively  moderate   wage   increases,   and   a   cyclical   upturn   in   labour    productivity.  Nevertheless,  headline  HICP  inflation   would fall only gradually, fr om 2.5% in 2003 to 1.7%  in    2005    as    HICP    energy    inflation    will    rise     considerably  in  2004  due  to  an  increase  in  excise   duties  with  effect  from  January  2004.  The  upward   impact   of   the   excise   increase   on   HICP   (which    includes   expenditure   by   non-residents)   is   much    stronger  than  on  the  CPI  due  to  the  larger  weight  of   fuel prices in the former.   Public finance   The   general   government   balance   is   projected   to    deteriorate   markedly   in   2004   and   2005,   by   2.2    percentage  points  of  GDP  in  total.  The  deterioration   in the balance from 2003 onwards can be attributed to  a  combination  of  weak  revenues,  not  offset  by  a   sufficiently  large  deceleration  in  public  expenditure.   The  sluggish  development  of  revenues  is  driven  both   by  the  tax  reforms  implem en ted  in  2001  and  2002,   and  by  cyclical  factors.  In  addition,  the  collection  of   substantial corporate back taxes will contribute less to  overall  revenue  in  2004  and  2005  than  in  the  two   previous  years.  The  deficit  would  increase  somewhat   in 2005, to 2.3% of GDP, as the positive impact of the  economic  upturn  on  the  government  accounts  would   become visible only with a delay. The low gross debt  ratio   would   decrease   somewhat   further   over   the    forecast horizon, from 4.9% of GDP in 2003 to 3.8%  of GDP in 2005. 		
April/2004	Netherlands	Weathering the storm 	The situation in 2003   In   the   fourth   quarter   of   2003   real   GDP   growth    (quarter-on-quarter  and  seasonally  adjusted)  turned   positive,  after  5  previous  quarters  of  negative  or   stagnant  growth.  However,  for  the  year  as  a  whole   real GDP declined by 0.8%, the first absolute decline  since  1982.  Against  a  background  of  low  confidence   among      producers      and      consumers,      private       consumption  growth  and  investment  were  strongly   negative.  This  was  due  to  balance  sheet  adjustments   of  firms  and  households,  weak  profits,  and  weak   purchasing power of households. Exports did not rise  due  to  the  weakness  in  global  trade,  aggravated  by   substantial   losses   in   competitiveness.   Employment    declined    and    the    unemployment    rate    increased     ma rkedly as the labour market responded with a lag to  the  economic  downturn  that  had  started  in  2001.   HICP inflation decreased from 3.9% in 2002 to 2.2%  in 2003, mainly accounted for by lower import prices  and falling profit margins.  According  to  provisional  data  for  2003,  the  general   government  deficit  increased  to  3.2%  of  GDP,  from   1.9%  of  GDP  in  2003.  The  deficit  increased  despite   substantial  consolidation  efforts  equivalent  to  more   than    1%    of    GDP.    The    weakening    of    central     government  revenues  in  response  to  the  economic   slowdown  was  the  main  reason  for  this  deterioration   in  the  government  balance  but  a  larger-than-foreseen   deficit of local authorities also played a role.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005   The  Dutch  economy  is  expected  to  recover  from  the   strong downturn experienced in the period 2001-2003,  but   only   slowly   compared   to   previous   cyclical    upswings.   Over   the   projection   horizon,   economic    activity would remain weaker than the EU average. In  the  course  of  2004,  economic  growth  is  expected  to   pick up moderately to 1% on average for the year as a  whole,  following  the  0.8%  decrease  of  real  GDP  last   year.  Real  GDP  growth  would  strengthen  somewhat   in 2005, to 1.6%. The upturn would be mainly driven  by  the  recovery  in  external  trade  but  is  expected  to   remain  quite  weak  compared  to  previous  upswings.   Price  competitiveness  would  start  to  improve  only  in   2005  as  the  negative  impact  of  high  price  and  wage   increases  in  past  years  would  fade  away.  The  growth   of  exports  would  also  be  held back  by  the  sensitivity   to  the  appreciation  of  the  euro  in  the  near  term,  and   the   composition   of   Dutch   exports   (tilted   towards    markets  with  relatively  weak  growth  and  products   which are especially in demand in the early stages of a  recovery).   Domestic   demand   would   remain   rather    weak  over  the  forecast  period,  reflecting  the  modest   development  of  disposable  income  (due  to  losses  in   employment  growth  and  wage  moderation),  ongoing   balance   sheet   adjustments   in   the   household   and    corporate  sectors,  and  the  impact  of  fiscal  tightening.   Private   consumption   will   be   held   back   by   the    combination  of  a  deteriorating  labour  market,  weak   income growth and, in 2004, a further increase in the  savings  ratio.  Most  of  the  projected  modest  gains  in   private   consumption   reflect   a   shift   from   publicly    financed  health  care  expenditure  to  private  funding.   Starting   from   a   relatively   low   rate   of   capacity    utilization, business investment is expected to recover  only gradually, as firms need to restore profitability.  The  situation  in  the  labour  market  is  expected  to   worsen  considerably  in  2004  with  the  number  of   persons   employed   decreasing   by   around   1%.   Job    losses  will  be  particularly  pronounced  in  the  market   sector.  The  projected  slight  gain  in  employment  in   2005   partly   reflects   the   impact   of   the   incipient    recovery,   but   is   also   accounted   for   by   statistical    changes  related  to  reforms  in  sickness  and  disability   insurance. Hence, the unemployment rate is projected  to  rise  substantially  over  the  projection  horizon,  to   5.3%  in  2004  and  6.0%  in  2005.  Wage  inflation  is   expected   to   decline   markedly   in   response   to   the    deterioration  in  the  labour  market  and  the  agreement   among   social   partners   to   moderate   wages.   With    contractual  wage  increases  in  newly  concluded  wage   agreements  close  to  zero  for  2004  and  2005,  total   compensation per employee in 2005 would decelerate  to zero as well, related to the reforms in sickness pay  and  the  accompanying  downward  effect  on  the  wage   drift  and  upward  effect  on  measured  employment.   Lower  import  prices  coupled  with  a  deceleration  in   unit  labour  costs  account  for  the  forecast  decrease  in   the  inflation  rate.  HICP  inflation  is  set  to  decline   further  to  1.4%  in  2004  and  0.7%  in  2005.  The   deceleration  of  inflation  is  cushioned  somewhat  by  a   recovery in profit margins.  Public finance   Under  the  assumption  of  no  changes  in  fiscal  policy,   the deficit would rise to 3.5% of GDP in 2004, despite  a  package  of  substantial  savings  of  around  1.2%  of   GDP  (primarily  consisting  of  expenditure  reductions)   which was included in the 2004 budget. This expected  further   worsening   of   the   government   accounts   in    2004,  despite  substantial  fiscal  tightening,  illustrates   the severity of the economic slowdown. Tax revenues  would   still   suffer   from   weak   economic   activity.    Whereas  expenditure  would  slow  down  also  due  to   substantial    savings    measures,    some    expenditure     overruns   have   an   upward   effect   on   the   deficit    projection for 2004. As public finances respond with a  lag  to  the  cycle  and  fiscal  tightening,  the  deficit  is   projected to decrease only somewhat in 2005, to 3.3%  of GDP. The debt ratio is expected to rise from 54.8%  of GDP in 2003 to around 58½% of GDP in 2005. In  view  of  the  severity  of  the  economic  downturn,  the   cyclically  adjusted  balance  is  expected  to  develop   mo re  favourably,  reaching  a  deficit  of  0.9%  of  GDP   in  2005.  In  response  to  the  projected  worsening  of   public   finances,   the   government   has   announced    additional  savings  measures,  intended  to  achieve  a   deficit  of  below  3%  of  GDP  from  2004  onwards.   However,  at  the  time  this  report  was  finalised  no   de tails  on  the  intended  measures  were  known,  and   hence  they  were  not  incorporated  in  the  baseline  of   the projections. 		
April/2004	Austria	Economy slowly picking up 	The situation in 2003   Activity   in   2003   was   sustained   by   the   domestic    demand  components,  with  household  consumption   expanding   moderately   and   investment   picking   up    after  the  slump  in  2002.  Exports  grew  moderately  as   demand  from  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  slackened   considerably.  Imports,  by  contrast,  edged  up  strongly   due  to  the  pick-up  of  investment,  resulting  in  a  high   negative  external  contribution  to  growth.  All  in  all,   real  GDP  growth  slowed  down  considerably  to  0.7%   from 1.4% in 2002.  Prospects in 2004 and 2005  Supported  by  rebounding  exports  on  the  back  of  the   international   upswing   together   with   strengthening    domestic   demand,   GDP   growth   is   projected   to    accelerate  to  1.8%  in  2004  and  further  to  a  rate  of   2.5% in 2005.    Household   real   disposable   income   will   rise   only    m oderately  in  2004.  Nevertheless,  pent-up  demand   and    a    revival    of    consumer    confidence    should     stimulate    private    consumption.    In    2005,    real     di sposable  income  will  be  boosted  by  a  pick-up  in   labour  demand,  slightly  declining  unemployment  and   a   significant   income   tax   relief.   This   should   give    further momentum to household demand, although the  decline in the saving ratio is projected to be reversed.  Public  consumption  is  expected  to  remain  subdued   throughout    the    forecast    period,    provided    the     government   implements   the   planned   reduction   in    public  personnel.    Despite  sufficient  spare  capacity,   equipment  investment  expanded  vigorously  in  2003,   helped  by  a  tax  incentive,  and  should  continue  to   accelerate  in  2004,  reflecting  the  improved  export   outlook. Also, construction investment is projected to  remain fairly strong throughout the forecast period. In  particular, civil engineering should continue to benefit  from   public   investment   in   infrastructure.   As   for    housing  investment,  an  impressive  upsurge  after  the   downward  trend  occurred  in  2003.  With  the  number   of  building  permits  expected  to  go  up  in  2004  and   slow   down   thereafter,   housing   investment   should    abate towards the end of the forecast period.  Exports  are projected to rebound in 2004 and gain momentum  in  2005,  but  with  imports  accelerating  at  the  same   time,  the  contribution  of  net  exports  to  GDP  growth   should remain negative in 2004 and turn neutral as of  2005. Labour market, costs and prices  Dependent   employment   expanded   moderately   in    2003,  as  a  consequence  of  the  deceleration  in  overall   output  growth.  Reflecting  the  usual  time-lag,  a  more   sustained  pick-up  in  labour demand  can  be  expected   only  as  of  2004.  Unemployment  is  likely  to  rise   further,  as  labour  supply  remains  elastic.  Only  by   2005,  the  increase  in  labour  demand  is  estimated  to   outpace  labour  supply,  translating  into  a,  if  small,   reduction in unemployment.   Consumer  price  inflation  is  set  to  remain  subdued   throughout the forecast period. The increase in energy  taxes  and  excise  duties  on  tobacco  in  2004  is  being   offset by a number of price dampening factors. While  wage  moderation  in  the  private  sector  is  expected  to   continue,  nominal  increases  in  contractual  wages  are   estimated to pick up in line with the projected cyclical  upswing.   In   the   public   sector,   moderate   wage    agreements   are   expected   to   contain   the   expected    deficit increase in 2005.  Public finances  In 2003, the budgetary position weakened. The deficit  widened by almost a full percentage point from 0.2%  of  GDP  in  2002  to  1.1%.  Expenditure  overshot  the   target,   reflecting   a   sharper-than-expected   rise   in    unemployment  and  additional  discretionary  spending   such  as  an  increase  in  social  transfers,  an  extra  pay- rise  for  public  sector  employees,  additional  labour   ma rket  expenditure  foreseen  in  the  fiscal  stimulus   package,  topped  by  deferred  flood-related  spending.   Tax     revenues,     by     contrast,     developed     more      favourably than budgeted, such that the deficit turned  out slightly below the official target.  In January 2004, the first step of an income tax reform  took effect. However, as tax cuts are largely offset by  a  rise  in  energy  taxes  and  social  contributions,  the   impact  on  the  general  government  budget  should  be   neutral.     As     regards     deficit-decreasing     effects,      expected  savings  from  the  pension  reform  for  private   and   federal   employees   are   considerable,   largely    outpacing   the   increase   in   discretionary   spending.    However,  several  factors  prevent  a  narrowing  of  the   deficit.  First,  certain  tax  relief  measures,  originally   planned   for   2005   and   worth   some   0.1   percentage    point  of  GDP,  were  brought  forward.  Second,  the   finance   ministry   revised   downwards   the   expected    surpluses of the sub-federal government levels by 0.2  percentage  point  to  0.5%  of  GDP.  Last  but  not  least,   central  bank  profits  (in  2003  but  affecting  the  budget   2004) are projected to turn out considerably lower due  to  low  interest  rates  and  the  depreciation  of  the  US- do llar.    As    a    result,    and    despite    the    expected     acceleration    in    domestic    demand,    the    general     government deficit is estimated to remain in the same  order of magnitude as in 2003. In  2005,  the  second  step  of  the  tax  reform  consisting   of  a  sizeable  income  tax  relief  for  both  households   and    enterprises    will    take    effect.    The    Austrian     government  has  submitted  a  draft  bill,  whose  main   components  can  be  expected  to  remain  unchanged   during  the  parliamentary  decision  making  process.     The  wage  and  income  tax  relief  and  tax  cuts  for   enterprises  are  planned  to  amount  to  some  0.5%  of   GDP  each.  In  addition,  excises  duties  with  negligible   revenue impact (“ Bagatellsteuern ”) will be abolished.  In total, the tax cuts planned for 2005 are worth some  1.0% of GDP.    To some extent, these revenue shortfalls will be offset  by  continued  structural  savings  from  the  pension  and   administrative     reforms.     Despite     the     projected      strengthening  of  domestic  demand  and  the  closing  of   the  output  gap,  the  general  government  deficit  is   projected to widen to almost 2% of GDP.  		
April/2004	Portugal	Export-led recovery from recession 	Overall developments and prospects  Following  the  cyclical  downturn  since  2001,  which   ended in a recession with GDP falling by an estimated  1.3%  in  2003,  economic  activity  is  projected  to  start   recovering as from the first half of 2004.   Real  GDP  is  forecast  to  gain  about  ½%  in  each   quarter  during  2004.  However,  given  the  negative   carryover  from  2003,  GDP  growth  is  projected  to   attain  only  ¾%  on  annual  average.  In  2005,  the   assumed  sustained  recovery  of  output  is  projected  to   raise annual growth of GDP to about 2¼%.   However, domestic demand is projected to lag behind  GDP growth. Although both private consumption and  investment are expected to gradually strengthen, both  components are projected to grow at a moderate pace  as  private  sector  agents  continue  to  redress  their   balance  sheets.  Government  spending,  for  its  part,   will  be  constrained  by  continued  efforts  at  budgetary   consolidation. The  economic  recovery  is  seen  driven  by  dynamic   export  growth,  reflecting  the  strengthening  of  foreign   demand (from 2¾% in 2002-2003 to about 7% in the  period   2004-2005)   and   supported   by   improved    price-competitiveness.   As   a   consequence   of   the    differential   pattern   of   external   versus   domestic    demand,  the  current  account  (including  net  capital   transactions) is expected to be close to balance by the  end of the forecast period.   Prices As  a  result  of  moderate  import  prices  and  low  wage   pressure, HICP inflation is set to decelerate further, to  an average of just above 2% in the projection period.   Labour market  In  the  period  2002-2003,  total  employment  declined   by  a  cumulative  0.6%,  while  the  unemployment  rate   increased  from  4.1%  in  2001  to  6.4%  in  2003.  In  the   period 2004-2005, the projected economic recovery is  expected   to   generate   a   cumulative   increase   in    employment of nearly 1%, keeping the unemployment  rate below 7%, edging down at the end of the period.   The cyclical downturn, together with a quasi-freeze in  government   wages   for   the   period   2003-2004,   is    expected  to  have  a  dampening  impact  also  on  wage   settlements  in  the  private  sector  of  the  economy.   Growth  of  total  wages  per  employee  is  projected  to   decelerate  from  5½%  in  2002  to  about  2½%  on   average  in  the  period  2004-2005,  such  that  the  trend   decline  in  price-competitiveness  looks  set  to  come  to   a halt. Households’  real  disposable  income  is  expected  to   grow  by  about  ¾%  per  year.  Given  the  assumptions   for   employment   and   wage   behaviour,   this   is   a    relatively  strong  pace,  reflecting  to  some  extent  also   declining inflation and strong social transfers.   Public finance  According  to  the  latest  reporting  of  deficit  and  debt   figures,  which  has  been  validated  by  Eurostat,  the   general government deficit reached an estimated value  of 2.8% of GDP in 2003 (2.7% in 2002).   The  economic  recession  of  2003,  leading  to  a  large   negative  output  gap,  has  considerably  hindered  the   process of budgetary consolidation. In fact, a massive  shortfall   in   tax   revenue   developed   during   2003    (excluding the one-off operation on the sale of tax and  social security contributions arrears).   On  the  expenditure  side,  by  contrast,  the  government   has  been  broadly  successful  in  securing  the  planned   restraint. Growth of total current primary expenditure  continued to decelerate from 8.9% in 2001 to 7.8% in  2 002  and  4.1%  in  2003.  This  basically  reflects  the   sharp  slowdown  in  government  consumption  due  to   the quasi-freeze of employment and nominal wages in  2003.   However,   these   revenue   and   expenditure    developments would have led to a government deficit  clearly above 3% of GDP in 2003. In order to prevent  this,  the  Portuguese  authorities  relied  on  two  one-off   m easures,  together  worth  2.1%  of  GDP,  namely  a   lump-sum  payment  from  a  public  enterprise  to  the   government in exchange of the transfer to the latter of  the responsibility for paying pensions, and the sale to  a  financial  institution  of  the  right  to  the  amounts   collected  in  future  concerning  tax  and  social  security   contributions arrears.   The  budget  for  2004  targets  a  general  government   deficit  of  2.8%  of  GDP.  The  forecast  takes  on  board   the  measures  included  in  the  budget,  including  the   one-off  measures  planned  so  far  for  2004  worth  €  1   billion (or 0.7% of GDP).   However,    the    Commission    projects    a    general     government deficit of 3.4% of GDP for 2004, thereby  above the official target. This difference can basically  be  accounted  for  by  three  elements:  (i)  a  growth   estimate ¼ pp lower in the Commission’s forecast; (ii)  base  effects  due  to  the  significant  amount  of  one-off   measures   adopted   in   2003,   mainly   affecting   the    revenue side; and (iii) the partial substitution of those  one-off  measures  i.e.  from  2.1%  of  GDP  to  so  far  a   planned value of 0.7% of GDP.   For  2005,  the  forecast  for  the  general  government   deficit  is  based  on  legislation  currently  in  force  (the   “no-policy-change”    assumption).    The    deficit    is     projected  to  rise  to  3.8%  of  GDP,  reflecting  the   persistence of a sizeable negative output gap, and the  phasing out of all one-off measures.  		
April/2004	Finland	Growth picking up on a broader base 	The economy in 2003   Even  though  economic  activity  held  up  better  than   expected,  growth  of  real  GDP  moderated  to  1.9%   from  2.3%  in  2002.  Domestic  demand  provided  the   main  support,  while  the  contribution  from  external   demand    was    subdued.    Household    consumption,     fuelled  by  higher  earnings,  tax  cuts  on  income  and   automobiles,  and  low  interest  rates,  grew  by  3.6%.   Purchases     of     durable     consumer     goods     were      particularly  buoyant.  Public  consumption  moderated   from  2002  to  0.7%.  Total  investment  contracted  for   the   second   consecutive   year.   Although   residential    construction  increased  strongly,  this  was  more  than   offset  by  a  slump  in  investment  in  equipment  and   commercial   building.   Due   to   uncertainties   in   the    global  economy  and  strong  euro,  demand  for  exports   was weaker than anticipated. The growth contribution  from  net  exports  fell  to  0.3  as  exports  and  imports   increased   by   1.3%   and   0.9%,   respectively.   The    weakening  in  the  terms  of  trade  continued  as  export   prices fell and import prices rose slightly.    Reflecting the subdued activity, employment declined  by  0.3%  from  2002.  Nevertheless,  unemployment   remained  broadly  stable  as  labour  supply  contracted   as  well.  Inflation  (HICP)  eased  from  an  average  of   2.0%  in  2002  to  1.3%  in  2003,  on  account  of  lower   prices   of   services   and   the   stronger   euro   holding    import prices down.   Prospects for 2004 and 2005  Downside  risks  in  the  international  economy  seem  to   have  abated  during  the  latter  part  of  2003  and  also   survey  indicators  seem  to  point  to  a  more  positive   outlook.  Growth  in  2004,  while  again  being  mainly   driven    by    private    consumption,    should    receive     increasing   support   from   exports   and   investments.    Consequently,  activity  is  set  to  expand  at  a  steady   pace  throughout  the  year,  yielding  average  growth   over 2½% in 2004 and 2.7% in 2005.   Job  creation  is  expected  to  pick  up  slightly  as  from   2004,     allowing     some     modest     inroads     into      unemployment.  GDP components   Private  consumption  is  expected to  continue  to  drive   the economy on the back of steady gains in disposable  income  following  from  wage  increases  and  income   tax cuts in 2004. In addition, higher dividend income  of  households,  as  dividends  will  be  partly  double   taxed  from  2005,  together  with  low  inflation  will   increase  real  disposable  income.  Public  consumption   is  expected  to  increase  modestly,  given  the  efforts  of   the    central    government    at    expenditure    control.     Investment,  seem  to  have  bottomed  out  during  the   second  half  of  2003  and  given  the  projected  stronger   stimulus    from    external    demand    and    improving     capacity  utilisation,  is  projected  to  revive  in  2004- 2005. Exports are expected to strengthen on the back of the  improved   international   economic   outlook   and   to    further   accelerate   in   2005.   In   spite   of   tightening    competition,     the     prospects     for     exports     of      telecommunication equipment appear promising. Also  the   outlook   for   the   forest   industry   seems   to   be    relatively   favourable.   However,   higher   consumer    spending  is  expected  to  raise  imports,  squeezing  the   contribution from the exter nal side to GDP growth.  Labour market, costs and prices  Alcohol tax cuts of 33% on average and lower import  prices  will  reduce  price  pressures,  bringing  HICP   inflation to below ½% in 2004. In 2005, inflation may  rise  to  1.5%,  as  the  economy  expands  and  the  effect   of  the  tax  cut  fades  away.  The  centralised  two-year   wage  agreement  provides  for  general  wage  rises  of   2.2% in 2004. Assuming the usual wage drift of about  1  percentage  point,  per-capita  wages  are  expected  to   increase   by   about   3½%   in   2004-05.   However,    accelerating   productivity   growth   appears   likely   to    curb the rise in unit labour costs.   Public finances  The general government surplus turned out at 2.3% of  GDP    in    2003,    broadly    as    anticipated.    Central     government  finances  were  still  in  surplus,  although   they   have   been   on   a   declining   trend   for   three    consecutive  years,  while  municipalities  continued  to   stay  in  deficit.  Based  on  the  government’s  medium- term  spending  guidelines  of  Spring  2004  and  the   budget  for  2004,  the  general  government  surplus  is   estimated  to  stay  around  2%  of  GDP  during  the   forecast period. Central government finances are seen  to  be  in  deficit  in  2004-05.  This  results  from  rising   expenditures  and  modestly  growing  overall  revenue   intake.   Moreover,   the   financial   position   of   local    governments  appears  to  stay  in  deficit  due  to  weak   growth   in   tax   receipts   and   higher   consumption    expenditures. Overall, the general government surplus  will be supported by the social security funds.  In  2003,  general  government  gross  debt  rose  by  2.7   percentage  points  to  45.3%  of  GDP  due  mainly  to  a   technical   change   in   the   classification   of   central    government  debt  as  the  repo  portfolio  was  removed   from  the  State  Treasury’s  balance  sheet.  The  debt   ratio is anticipated to ease to about 44.3% of GDP by  the end of the forecast period. 		
April/2004	Sweden	teady recovery after a mild trough	The situation in 2003   Swedish economic growth decelerated mildly in 2003,  with  GDP  growth  of  1.6%,  compared  with  2.1%  in   2002.  Exports  improved  considerably  after  two  years   of poor growth. At the same time, imports rose faster  but   overall,   net   exports   contributed   positively   to    growth.  On  the  domestic  side,  economic  activity  was   mixed.  Private  consumption  growth  was  relatively   strong  and  grew  faster  than  in  2002,  despite  negative   employment    growth.    Relatively    high    consumer     confidence,  buoyed  by  a  rise  in  share  prices  and  in   house  prices  is  likely  to  have  contributed  to  this.  By   contrast,  investment  developed  very  poorly  and  fell   for   the   third   year   in   a   row.   Public   consumption    growth eased considerably, reflecting some budgetary  constraints.  Inflation  has  come  down  markedly  in   recent  months  and  as  inflationary  pressures  should   remain subdued, the Riksbank cut the repo-rate again  in early 2004.  Prospects in 2004 and 2005   Recent  indicators  are  positive,  with  both  consumers   and  business  expectations  at  relatively  high  levels.   The  consumer  confidence  indicator,  and  in  particular   consumers'     expectations     regarding     their     own      economic   situation,   continued   to   give   a   positive    picture    in    March,    though    slightly    down    from     February.   Business   confidence   indicators   too   are    encouraging.  The  industrial  confidence  indicator  has   been  rising  since  last  autumn  and  stood  above  its   long-term    average    in    March.    The    purchasing     manage rs  index  too  has  risen  in  recent  months  and   was   well   above   the   50-mark   in   February.   These    prospects  are  expected  to  result  in  a  continuation  of   the   recovery   in   2004.   Domestic   demand   growth    should  become  stronger  and  external  demand  growth   should   pick   up   further   during   2004,   resulting   in    stronger  exports  and  a  larger  positive  contribution   from   net   exports.   In   2005,   economic   growth   is    expected  to  continue  to  strengthen,  as  the  recovery   should  be  more  firmly  in  place.  Overall,  GDP  is   expected to grow by 2.3% in 2004 and 2.6% in 2005.  Disposable  income  growth  is  expected  to  be  stronger   in   2004   compared   with   last   year,   providing   for    continued   steady   growth   in   private   consumption.    Consumer   confidence   has   improved   significantly    recently.   Financial   wealth   has   partially   recovered    from  the  long  slump  in  the  stock  markets,  with  the   recent   rise   in   equity   prices.   House   prices   have    continued  to  rise  steadily,  contributing  to  a  relatively   strong  wealth  position  of  households.  In  2005,  a   resumption  of  employment  growth  is  expected  to   contribute to household disposable income. Moreover,  the  saving  rate  of  households  remained  very  high  at   11% in 2003, though it was down compared with the  previous  year.  An  additional  modest  reduction  of  the   saving  rate  is  expected  this  year  and  next.  All  in  all,   this should result in stable consumption growth in the  years  to  2005.  Public  consumption  is  expected  to   continue   to   be   relatively   weak   over   the   forecast    period,  in  part  due  to  budgetary  constraints  at  the   local and central level. The latest investment survey in  industry  point  to  a  strong expansion  in  2004  and  the   improved  outlook  for  external  demand,  including  for   the  ICT  sector,  suggest  higher  investment.  A  rise  in   investment  is  foreseen  for  2004  and  further  in  2005,   as   economic   activity   gathers   momentum   and   the    productive capacity needs to be expanded, following a  period  of  falling  investment.  In  2004  and  2005,  a   further  recovery  in  exports  is  expected,  as  noted   above.   Imports   too   should   continue   to   rise,   in    particular    in    2005,    as    final    demand    recovers     gradually, resulting in a positive contribution from net  exports in 2004 and slightly so also in 2005.  Labour market, costs and prices  Employment growth has been negative since the latter  half    of    2003.    During    the    same    period    the     unemployment  rate  has  risen,  in  part as  a  result of fewer  people  engaged  in  labour  market  programmes.   The  gradual  increase  in  economic  activity  foreseen   from   2004   onwards   is   expected   to   result   in   an    improvement in the labour market only in 2005.  Inflation   has   come   down   considerably   since   the    electricity  and  energy  price  hike  last  year  and  also   reflecting  relatively  weak  economic  activity  in  2003.   Inflationary  pressures  should  be  very  subdued  this   year  and  as  demand  and  growth  revives  further  in   2005,  inflation  is  expected  to  gradually  rise  towards   2%  at  the  end  of  2005.  With  gradually  stronger   growth over this period, interest rates may start to rise  next  year.  New  wage  agreements  for  most  of  the   labour  market  are  expected  to  be  reached  this  spring   and  are  likely  to  result  in  moderate  wage  increases.   This can partly be attributed to the deterioration in the  labour  market  since  last  year,  expected  to  continue   into this year and only revert in 2005.   Public finances   In  2004,  the  surplus  in  public  finances  is  expected  to   remain   relatively   low.   Despite   stronger   economic    growth  being  projected  this  year,  the  continued  poor   developments  in  the  labour  market,  with  a  rise  in  the   unemployment  rate,  weigh  on  the  public  finances.  In   2004,  the  expenditure  ceiling  on  central  government,   announced  in  the  Budget  Bill  for  2004,  helps  to   contain  expenditure.  In  2005,  a  higher  surplus  in  the   public finances is projected on current policies, due to  stronger     economic     activity     and     an     expected      improvement     in     the     labour     market.     General      government   debt,   which   mainly   lies   in   central    government, is projected to rise as central government  is  expected  to  remain  in  deficit  over  the  forecast   period. The rise is however slower than nominal GDP  over the forecast period, resulting in a fall in the debt  ratio to a bit above 50% of GDP in 2005.  		
April/2004	United Kingdom	Above-trend growth, as investment and net exports revive 	The situation in 2003   The  UK  economy  weathered  the  recent  global  slow- down   relatively   well,   with   growth   slightly   below    trend  at  2.2%.  Strong  household  consumption  and   general   government   spending   continued   to   drive    growth, offset by weakness in net exports.  Though     weaker     overall     than     2002,     private      consumption    expenditure    remained    a    significant     driver of growth, particularly in the second half of the  year.  Fixed  investment  picked  up  strongly  over  the   course     of     2003,     while     general     government      consumption  also  remained  firm.  The  pickup  in  the   global  economy  meant  that  the  drag  on  growth  from   net  exports  slowed,  with  firm  export  growth  notable   in  Q4.  However,  weakness  in  the  sterling  effective   exchange  rate  during  the  first  half  of  the  year  was   largely  reversed  by  the  subsequent  appreciation,  thus   removing  a  potential  stimulus  to  growth  in  export   volumes.  Growth  was  strongest  in  the  service  and  construction   sectors,    where    continued    strength    in    housing     construction    caused    output    to    grow    by    5%.     Manufacturing output grew for 4 consecutive quarters  for the first time since 2000.    The    labour    market    has    remained    strong,    with     unemployment  falling  to  around  5%.  Despite  this,   inflationary   pressures   have   remained   subdued.   In    December  2003,  the  Government  announced  that  the   Bank   of   England   would   switch   to   a   symmetric    inflation  target  based  on  the  harmonised  index  of   consumer  prices,  known  in  the  UK  as  CPI.  CPI   remained   comfortably   below   the   new   2%   target    throughout     2003,     within     the     permitted     one- percentage-point symmetrical margin.     Autumn   2003   also   saw   extensive   revisions   to    historical  national  accounts  data  by  the  Office  for   National      Statistics      following      methodological       improvements.  The  new  numbers  indicate  that  UK   GDP  growth  was  more  robust  between  1998  and   2000,  and  more  balanced  than  previously  thought,   with    less    household    and    general    government     consumption   and   better   corporate   investment   and    exports. Prospects in 2004 and 2005  Growth  is  forecast  to  be  slightly  above  trend  in  both   2004  and  2005,  reaching  around  3%  in  2004,  before   m oderating  to  2.8%  in  2005.  The  current  estimated   negative  output  gap,  of  around  ½%  of  GDP,  should   therefore  close  over  the  forecast  horizon.  Domestic   demand   is   expected   to   strengthen   in   2004,   with    continued  strength  in  household  consumption,  and  a   significant  pick-up  in  corporate  investment.  As  the   global    outlook    improves,    exports    should    also     improve.  Strong  household  consumption  growth  is  expected  to   m oderate  over  the  forecast  period  from  the  robust   growth  reported  in  the  second  half  of  2003,  as  house   price  growth  slows  and  interest  rate  rises  begin  to   bite.  In  line  with  the  government’s  plans,  growth  of   government  consumption  will  continue  to  support   growth throughout the forecast period.   Fixed   investment   is   expected   to   recover   strongly    following  a  prolonged  period  of  weakness,  due  to   improvements  in  business  expectations.  Construction   growth  is  forecast  to  moderate,  more  than  offset  by   markedly stronger investment in equipment.   Robust  growth  of  investment  in  equipment  should   contribute to higher goods imports.  However, despite  strong   growth   in   exports   throughout   the   forecast    period  as  the  global  outlook  improves,  net  exports   will continue to act as a drag on GDP growth in 2004.    Labour market, costs and prices  Unemployment  is  expected  to  remain  low  and  stable   at  around  5%,  close  to  its  NAIRU  level,  throughout  the  forecast  period.    Employment  should  continue  to   grow, though more moderately than in recent years. In  the  face  of  strengthening  demand,  wage  growth  is   expected   to   rise,   particularly   as   bonus   payments    become more widespread. However, with productivity  growth   expected   to   improve   from   the   low   rate    observed  in  2003,  unit  labour  cost  rises  should  be   m oderate over the forecast period.   Both  consumer  and  producer  output  price  indices   suggest  inflationary  pressures  remain  subdued.  At   1.3%   in   December,   CPI   inflation   is   low,   but   is    expected to rise toward its 2% target over the forecast  period  as  the  output  gap  closes.  In  taking  a  forward- looking  approach  to  monetary  policy,  the  Bank  of   England  has  raised  interest  rates  twice,  by  25  basis   points in both November 2003 and February 2004.  Public finances  The public finances have deteriorated markedly since  2002.   In   2003,   the   general   government   finances    recorded  a  deficit  of  3.2%  of  GDP,  significantly   higher  than  the  UK  authorities’  forecasts  in  April   2003, in large part due to a downgrading of expected  revenue linked to composition effects of GDP growth  and  to  higher  discretionary  expenditure  related  to  the   Iraq  war.  The  deficit  is  expected  to  narrow  over  the   forecast period as discretionary expenditure growth is  forecast  to  slow  relative  to  2003  -  it  is  assumed  that   expenditure  will  turn  out  broadly  as  projected  by  the   authorities,   in   nominal   terms.   Revenues,   notably    income  and  corporation  tax,  are  expected  to  increase   as  a  consequence  of  stronger  GDP  growth,  but  at  a   lower pace than in the Budget forecast. The projected  de ficits  decline  to  around  2.8%  of  GDP  in  2004,   declining further to 2.6% in 2005.  The ratio of gross  debt  to  GDP,  though  increasing  slightly,  is  expected   to be close to 40% by the end of 2005.  		
November/2003	Cyprus	Positive growth but hit hard by international tension and weak EU growth	The economy in 2002  Due to low EU growth and international tension, tourist  arrivals  fell  steeply  in  2002.  However,  Cyprus  still   managed  GDP  growth  of  2%  that  year,  supported  by   moderate  domestic  demand.  At  the  same  time,  fiscal   policy      slipped,      turning      more      expansionary.       Consumption  growth  remained  modest  at  2.5%,  in  line   with   moderate   wage   growth   and   weak   consumer    confidence,  but  supported  by  an  increase  in  disposable   income   linked   to   tax   reform   and   continuing   full- employment  conditions.  Investment  increased  by  10%,   partly  stimulated  by  interest  rate  reductions  to  counter   the external demand shock, but also included purchases  of ships/aircraft.   Strongly   hit   by   international   developments,   exports    dropped  by  more  than  5%  mostly  due  to  a  sharp   decrease  in  tourist  arrivals   of  10%.  Imports  declined   marginally as a result of lower exports and the domestic  demand  deceleration.  Overall   this  widened  the  current   account deficit to 5.3% of GDP.   Prospects  For 2003, the forecas t projects modest real GDP growth  of   2%,   pushed   by   domestic   demand.   For   2004   a    rebound  to  3.4%  is  expected,  increasing  in  strength  in   2005  as  external  demand   picks  up  while  domestic   private demand remains the driving force.   The  economy,  with  tourism   as  a  mainstay,  has  shown   some  resilience  in  the  face  of   a  difficult  international   environment. Economic imbalances have increased, but  prospects  are  for  a  slow  re turn  to  more  sustainable   levels.   Costs and prices  Prices in 2002 and 2003 were mainly pushed by higher  VAT  taxation  related  to  the  EU  accession.  Inflation   reached 2.8% in 2002 and ra n at 6.3% y-o-y by March  2003  before  easing  to  2.4%  by  August.  For  the  year,   inflation  is  expected  to  peak  at  4.3%,  but  then  to  fall   back to 2% for the remaining forecast period.   The  Central  Bank  has  achieved   a  solid  track  record  on   containing inflation and keeping the pound stable vis-à- vis  the  euro.  Monetary  policy  followed  the  subdued   economic  activity  and  this  led,  together  with  stricter   credit  risk  assessment  applied  by  banks,  to  declining   growth rates in money supply and lower interest rates in  2002. Annual money supply (M2) growth in early 2003  decelerated  further  to  9%  in   April  2003.  At  the  same   time, the Cyprus pound remained stable against the euro  in 2002 and in the course of 2003.  GDP components  Private  consumption  growth  for  2003  is  expected  to   remain below 3%, subsequently picking up as consumer  confidence   restores.   However,   modest   increases   in    earnings  and  a  shift  of  the  tax  burden  to  consumption   will   limit   consumption   expansion.   For   this   year,    investment  is  foreseen  to  decline  by  4.5%,  although   when  corrected  for  ships  and  aircraft  purchases  last   year,  growth  would  still  be  above  4%  on  an  annual   basis.  For  the  remainder  of  the  period,  investment   should  rebound;  factors  stimulating  investment  are  still   in   place,   such   as   EU   accession,   liberalisation   in    financial     and     utilities     markets,     and     planned      infrastructure  projects  (air ports  in  Larnaca  and  Paphos   and a port in Larnaca).  In  the  first  half  of  2003  the  decline  in  tourist  arrivals   continued,  linked  to  the  Iraq  war  and  SARS.  Tourism   arrivals  now  look  to  decrease  by  5%.  Arrivals  are   expected  to  revive  gradually  in  2004-5,  in  line  with   historical   experience   but   also   reflecting   the   global    recovery  and  positive  spill-over  of  the  2004  Olympic   Games  in  Athens.  Export  growth  is  therefore  projected   to increase to above 5%. Impo rt growth remains almost  nil  in  2003  as  domestic  demand  growth  slows  down,   but is foreseen to pick up in line with the resumption in  export  and  domestic  demand  expansion  but  curbed  by   ad  hoc   factors  such  as  a  fall  in  defence  equipment   imports.   The   current   account   deficit   is   therefore    projected  downward  from  a  deficit  of  5.3%  of  GDP  in   2002 to 2.8% by 2005.  Labour market  With unemployment rates at around 3.5%, Cyprus does  not have an unemployment problem. The labour market  is  relatively  flexible  while  imported  seasonal  labour   also  takes  some  of  the  strain  in  some  labour  market   segments.  Despite  lower  growth,  the  unemployment   rate decreased to about 3½% in 2002 and is expected to  increase  marginally  in  2003   before  falling  back  again,   as GDP growth picks up.   Public finances  The   fiscal   consolidation   programme   slipped   as   the    deficit   climbed   to   3.5%   of   GDP   in   2002.   The    programme   was   abandoned   in   2003   due   to   the    economic  slowdown,  increa sed  defence  outlays,  and   expansionary expenditure measures introduced to offset  subdued  external  demand.  For  2003  the  deficit  is  now projected  to  sharply  rise   to  above  5%  of  GDP.  To   counter  this  slippage,  the government  adopted  a  new   consolidation   programme.    The   forecast   sets   for   a    gradually  declining  -but  still  relatively  high-  deficit  of   about 3% by 2005. 		
November/2003	Czech Republic	Deteriorating public finances	The economy in 2002 and  the first half of 2003  In 2002, real GDP growth was 2.0% despite the August  floods,  the  strengthened  national  currency  and  sluggish   external  demand.  The  main  driving  force  of  economic   growth     was     domestic     consumption.     Household      consumption grew by 4% and government consumption  by  5.7%.  Fixed  investment  grew  by  a  disappointing   0.6%.  In  the  first  half  of  2003,   the  performance  of  the  Czech   economy    remained    solid,     even    with    a    difficult     economic  environment.  GDP  growth  reached  2.3%,   being  mostly  driven  by  household  consumption  which   grew  by  5%.  This  growth  was  mainly  due  to  the   combination of high real increase in disposable income  and   of   low   nominal   interest   rates   that   enabled   an    expansion of consumer credit. The growth rate of gross  fixed capital formation was  negative (-0.3%). Although  exports  expressed  in  current  koruna  prices  went  up  by   7.9%  in  the  first  half  of  2003,  imports  also  increased   (by 7.3%) and net exports made a negative contribution  to GDP growth (–1.6 percentage points). Growth prospects  The  immediate  outlook  for   the  Czech  economy  is  for   moderate economic growth for the rest of 2003, leading  to   an   annual   growth   rate   of   2.2%.   The   growth    composition  should  basically  stay  the  same  as  in  the   first  half  of  the  year  –  domestic  consumption  having  a   positive  impact  and  gross  fixed  capital  formation  and   net  exports  having  a  negative  contribution  to  GDP   growth.  Growth prospects for 2004 and 2005 largely depend on  the   degree   of   economic   recovery   in   the   EU,   in    particular in Germany. They will also be influenced by  the  recently  adopted  fiscal   consolidation  package.  The   GDP growth rate is predicte d to accelerate and to reach  2.6%  in  2004  and  3.3%  in  2005.  Due  to  increases  in   indirect  taxes,  household  consumption  is  projected  to   decelerate  in  2004  and  to   increase  somewhat  again  in   2005, in line with the assumed economic recovery. Due  to    cuts    in    government    expenditures,    government     consumption  will  decrease  in  2004  and  increase  only   slightly   in   2005.   Gross   fixed   capital   formation   is    expected   to   increase.   Net    exports   are   projected   to    remain a negative growth contributor.   Inflation  In  the  first  half  of  2003 ,  the  Czech  Republic  faced  a   new phenomenon – falling pri ces. From January to May  2003,  the  annual  increase  in  the  harmonised  index  of   consumer  prices  remained  slightly  negative;  in  June   2003, the annual increase was zero, and in July it turned  negative  again.  For  the  whole  period,  the  monetary   authorities were undershooting the inflation target. This  undershooting  was  mainly  a  result  of  an  unexpected   disinflationary  effect  of  the  external  environment,  in   particular  by  a  lower-than-expected  increase  in  food   and  regulated  prices  and  by   the  stronger  exchange  rate   of the koruna.  At  the  end  of  2003,  HICP  inflation  is  expected  to   remain  zero.  In  2004,  inflation  is  likely  to  increase  to   3.3%  on  average,  mainly  as  a  consequence  of  higher   indirect  taxes.  Thereafter,   the  annual  HICP  is  expected   to  come  down  to  2.6%  in  2005,  assuming  that  second- round  effects  of  indirect  tax  increases  are  kept  under   control. Labour market   The   labour   market   was   affected   by   the   ongoing    restructuring   of   the   Czech   economy.   The   rate   of    unemployment  was  7.3%  at  the  end  of  2002,  going  up   slightly  afterwards  (7.6%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2003).   In  addition  to  the  restructuring  process,  unemployment   will be affected by the pub lic finance reform, according  to  which  2%  of  public  sector  employees  should  be   dismissed annually over the period 2004-2006 The  ILO  survey-based  unempl oyment  rate  is  expected   to  increase  to  7.8%  at  the  end  of  2003  and  to  reach   8.1% in 2004. Afterwards, it is projected to fall slightly  to 8.0% in 2005.  Current account  The  trade  balance  is  expected  to  deteriorate  slightly  in   2003  as  a  consequence  of  high  domestic  consumption   and  of  the  economic  slowdown  in  the  EU,  mainly  in   Germany.  The  small  improvement  in  the  trade  balance   in  2004  will  mainly  reflect  lower  imports  due  to  the   public   finance   reform   which   will   negatively   affect    domestic  demand.  The  worsening  in  2005  will  be  a   consequence   of   increasing   investments,   which   are    import  intensive.  After  the  deterioration  in  2002,  the   surplus in the balance of serv ices as percentage of GDP  is expected to remain constant in 2003 and 2004 (1% of  GDP)  and  to  improve  slightly  in  2005.  The  income   balance  should  worsen  in  2004  as  profits  of foreign   investors   are   expected   to   be   repatriated,   which   is    partially  linked  to  the  effort  of  EU-based  companies  to   improve  their  balance  sheets.  As  a  result,  the  current   account deficit should increase  to 6.9% of GDP in 2004  and then to decrease to 6.6% of GDP.  Public finances  According  to  ESA95  data  communicated  by  the  Czech   authorities,   the   general   government   deficit   in   2002    reached   7.1%   of   GDP   –   reflecting   partly   high    expenditures in the election year and capital transfers to  the  Czech  Consolidation  Ag ency.  Gross  public  debt   was 27.1% of GDP.  In  2003,  the  general  government  deficit  is  projected  to   worsen  further  and  to  reach  8.0%  of  GDP  and  then  to   improve  to  6.3%  of  GDP  in  2004  and  5.2%  of  GDP  in   2005  as  a  consequence  of   fiscal  reform.  Gross  public   debt  is  expected  to  increase  from  30.7%  of  GDP  in   2003 to 38.3% of GDP in 2005. 		
November/2003	Estonia	Strong domestic demand, and a weak  external environment, will exacerbate  the current account deficit in 2003 	Real  GDP  is  expected  to  grow  by  some  4½%  in  2003,   and  close  to  potential  in  2004-05.    Strong  domestic   demand will be the main source of growth in 2003, and  to  a  lesser  extent  in  2004.  As  the  contribution  from   domestic     demand     gradually     abates     a     steady      improvement in the external environment will maintain  the  economy's  momentum.  Consequently  the  current   account  deficit  is  forecast  to   narrow  to  some  8½  %  in   2005.    The  general  government  budget  is  forecast  to   remain balanced on a yearly basis, although slippages at  the local government level could result in a small deficit  in 2004.  The economy in 2002  GDP  growth  of  some  6%  in  2002  was  underpinned  by   buoyant  private  consumption  and  investment  growth,     driven  by  low  interest  rates,  and  strong  wage  and   employment  growth.  A  mismatch  between  domestic   and foreign demand was manifested in a robust demand  for  imports  (10.2%  increase  in  2002),  and  a  relatively   sluggish export performance (6% increase in 2002), and  resulted in a deterioration of the current account deficit  to  some  12.3%  of  GDP  in  2002.  CPI  inflation  receded   to    2.7%    by    end-2002    owing    to    exchange    rate     movements,  and  other  temporary  factors  (e.g.,  food   prices). Labour market conditions continued to improve  and,   according   to   the   la bour   force   survey,   the    unemployment  rate  declined  to  10.3%  of  the  labour   force   in   2002.      The   general   government   surplus    increased  to  around  1%  of   GDP  mainly  on  account  of   buoyant  growth,  and  despite  additional  spending  of   some  1.1%  of  GDP  approved  by  the  parliament  in  two   supplementary budgets.  GDP components Monetary   conditions   will   remain   favourable   during    2003,    and    domestic    demand—particularly    private     consumption  which  is  forecast  to  grow  by  6.5%—will   continue   to   be   the   main   source   of   growth.   Fixed    investment  growth  will  decel erate  from  16.1%  in  2002   to  12%  in  2003,  as  enterprises  cut  back  on  investment   spending and the effects of one-off investment projects  dissipate.  However,  as  the  current  monetary  policy   cycle  in  the  eurozone  unw inds  in  2004-05  and  the   external     environment     impr oves     further,     tighter      monetary   conditions   and   a   gradual   increase   in   the    savings of households and firms will restraint domestic  demand,   turning   the   contribution   from   net   exports    positive.  Hence,  the  forecast  for  2004-05  envisages  a   more  balanced  growth  outlook  given  weaker  domestic   demand—which is forecast to grow by 5.3% and 4% in  2004  and  2005  respectively,   compared  with  8%  in   2002—,  and  the  steady  impr ovement  in  the  external   outlook.  Accordingly,  real  GD P  is  expected  to  grow  at   around 5-5½ %, or close to potential in 2004-05.   Costs and prices  Inflation     dynamics     in     Estonia     have     mirrored      developments in the EU in recent years, although higher  oil  prices  and  a  depreciating  euro  contributed  to  an   acceleration  of  inflation  to   almost  7%  in  mid-2001.   Inflationary  pressures  receded  subsequently  and  CPI   inflation  decelerated  to  2. 7%  by  end-2002,  while  the   differential  with  the  euro  ar ea  narrowed  to  less  than  ½   percentage  point.  The  drop  in  inflation  toward  the  end   of the year, and during the first half of 2003, was due to  temporary factors. Hence, the forecast envisages a pick- up  in  inflation  in  the  second  half  of  2003,  and  during   2004.  Additionally,  a  number  of  measures  including   tax,  and  administered  price,  hikes  will  contribute  to   higher  prices  and  inflation   is  forecast  to  reach  4%  in   2004,  although  is  expected  to  fall  slightly  thereafter  to   3.7% in 2005.  Labour Market  In  spite  of  a  strong  growth  performance,  and  sizeable   employment   gains   since   2001,   the   unemployment    rate—which   remains   at   ar ound   10%   of   the   labour    force—is   forecast   to   decline   only   slightly   in   the    medium   term   to   around   9%   of   the   labour   force.    Moderate   employment   gains   will   contribute   to   the    decline     in     the     unemployment     rate,     although      considerable  skills  mismatch  will  hold  back  a  faster   improvement in labour market conditions  Balance of payments  The  global  economic  slowdown,  and  in  particular  the   ensuing slump in the telecommunication sector, led to a  dramatic  deceleration  in  Esto nia's  export  growth  since   mid-2001. The delayed recovery in the EU is having its  impact on demand for exports for Estonian goods which  are  forecast  to  grow  by  5%  in  2003.  At  the  same  time,   imports are expected to incr ease by 9% and the current  account  deficit  is  consequen tly  expected  to  widen  to   15.2%  in  2003.  As  the  recovery  in  the  EU  gathers   momentum,  export  growth  in  Estonia  is  forecast  to   gradually accelerate to 10% in 2004, and some 12% by  2005. Import growth will be less buoyant in 2004 partly  as  a  result  of  the  high  level  of  imports  in  2003  (and   hence base effects), and weaker investment activity. As  the    external    environment    improves    further,    and     investment  activity  recovers,  demand  for  imports  both   for  consumer  goods  and  for  intermediate  inputs  will   accelerate    to    10%    in    20 05.    Consequently,    the     contribution   of   net   exports   is   forecast   to   become    positive, and the current account deficit narrow to 8.5%  of GDP by 2005.  Public finances  Fiscal  discipline  and  a  better  than  expected  growth   performance  both  contributed  to  an  increase  in  the   general government surplus, from ½% of GDP in 2001  to  around  1¼%  of  GDP  in  2002.  Windfall  revenues  of   some 1.4% of GDP also led to a significant increase in  government spending by 0.7% of GDP compared to the  2003  budget.  Local  governments  continued  to  be  a   drain   on   public   finances,   with   significant   budget    slippages  in  2002,  and  projected  expenditure  overruns   for 2003. In 2004, plans for tax cuts could put pressure  of    public    finances,    particularly    at    the    central     government  level,  although  projected  higher  cyclical   tax  revenues,  and  strict  expe nditure  control  will  offset   some  of  the  revenue  losses.  Several  other  tax  changes,   mostly  for  accession  to  the  EU,  will  also  provide   additional  revenues  in  2004.  Expenditure  slippages  at   the  local  government  level  could,  however,  result  in  a   small general government deficit in 2004. 		
November/2003	Hungary	Re-balancing the economy 	The economy in 2003   The    overall    macro-economic    equilibrium    of    the     Hungarian  economy  has  deteriorated  since  2002.  In  a   difficult   external   environment,   but   supported   by   a    strong  demand-side  stimulus,  GDP  grew  by  3.3%  in   2002.  During  the  first  half  of  2003,  the  growth  rate   decreased  to  2.6%  year-on- year.  Following  last  year’s   exceptionally  high  budget  deficit,  fiscal  policy  was   significantly  tightened  in  2003.  Coupled  with  unstable   monetary and exchange rate policies, the forint suffered  greater volatility, and risk premiums have risen sharply.  The   exporting   industry,   including   foreign   tourism,    suffered  from  declining  external  demand  which  until   January  2003  was  combined  with  a  strong  appreciation   of the currency. As a conse quence, the external balance  has started to deteriorate in  2002, with a  current account  deficit   of   4%   of   GDP   in   2002.   Investment   (FDI)    decreased  markedly   in  2002,  to  1.8%  of  GDP,  with  a   further  deterioration  of  this  trend  in  the  first  half  of   2003.  As  a  result,  there  was  a  net  outflow  of  capital   over  the  first  half  of  2003,  and  the  current  account   deficit  is  financed  exclusiv ely  through  th e  increase  in   net external debt.   Prospects  The  immediate  outlook  for   the  Hungarian  economy  is   for  a  relatively  moderate  growth  rate  in  2003  of  2.9%,   assuming an upswing in the s econd half of the year. On  the basis of an assumed rec overy in the EU – Hungary’s  main trading partner – growth  is expected to accelerate  to  3.2%  in  2004  and  further  to  3.4%  in  2005.  In  both   years   a   continuation   of   relatively   strong   domestic    demand,  continued  public  investment  in  infrastructure   and  a  combination  of  recovering  exports  and  foreign   tourism are expected to be th e driving forces of growth.   GDP components   Private  consumption  in  the  first  half  of  2003  expanded   more  rapidly  than  GDP  growth,  and  is  expected  to  be   9.8%  in  2003,  while  growth  in  investment  will  remain   nearly  flat.  Private  consump tion  is  expected  to  slow   down  in  2004  to  4.0%  due  to  more  moderate  wage   developments,  while  increasing  again  somewhat  at  the   end  of  the  forecasting  period   to  4.6%,  in  line  with  the   economic recovery.  The   net   export   contribution   is   expected   to   remain    negative   over   the   entire   fo recast   period,   but   on   a    gradually   improving   trend,   in   line   with   growing    external  demand.  Imports  are  expected  to  grow  around   a  rate  of  7-8%  throughout  2004  and  2005,  given  the   high   import   contribution   contained   in   Hungarian    exports   along   with   continuing   demand   for   private    consumption.  Costs and prices  The disinflation of the recent  years came to a halt in the  first  half  of  2003.  Inflation  is  expected  to  increase   somewhat  over  the  second   half  of  2003,  thereafter   reaching  an  annual  average   of  4.6%.  The  increase  is   expected  to  be  the  result  of  the  weaker  exchange  rate,   the proposed increase of regulated prices and measures  aimed  at  reducing  the  excess  supply  of  foodstuffs.  In   2004,  a  temporary  increase  to   6.1%  on  average  can  be   expected, due to the deregula tion of administered prices  and  the  expected  one-off  upw ard  pressure  on  the  price   level  caused  by  the  projected  changes  to  indirect  taxes.   Thereafter,  average  CPI  infla tion  is  expected  to  come   down to 4.1% in 2005.  With  the  economy  slowly  adapting  to  the  new  low- inflation environment, wage developments in 2003 have  started to be more moderate from their previously high  growth rates, especially  in the corporate sector.  Nevertheless,  also  in  2003  real  wage  growth  at  around   13%  continues  to  exceed  pr oductivity  growth  by  a   considerable   margin.   Real    wages   are   expected   to    become   more   in   line   with   productivity   increases,    slowing down to 8.0% in 2002 and 6.7% in 2005.  Labour market   Although the unemployment ra te temporarily increased  to over 6% in the first half of 2003, the labour market in  the  skilled  segment  and  in  the  industrialised  regions  of   the   country   remains   tight,   while   participation   rates    continue  to  be  very  low.  During  the  June  to  August   2003  period,  the  ILO  unemployment  rate  was  down  to   5.7%.  Overall  unemployment  is  expected  to  stabilise   around this level over the forecasting period.  Public finances   For  2003,  the  government  is  aiming  at  a  deficit  target   below 5% of GDP, which would represent a turnaround   after the strong fiscal expansion of 2002. Consequently,  the general government deficit is on a downward trend,  following  a  redirection  of  fiscal  policy  since  2003.  In   late  September  2003,  a  tight  budget  for  2004  was   adopted  by  the  government.  This  austerity  programme   addresses some structural problems on the revenue and  expenditure   side   of   the   Hungarian   budget.   Budget    deficits in ESA 95 terms are forecast at 5.4% of GDP in  2003,  4.4%  in  2004  and  3.6%  in  2005.  The  debt  of  the   general government, which currently stands at 56.3% of  GDP is expected to increase further to 57.9% of GDP in  2003,  before  gradually  coming  down  to  56.9%  in  2004   and to 55.5% in 2005. 		
November/2003	Latvia	Strong consumption and large current account deficit	Activity in 2002 and prospects  In  2002,  Latvian  economic  activity  has  remained  firm   despite   a   weak   external   environment.   GDP   growth    remained strong at 6.1% in  2002 and accelerated further  to  7.5%  in  the  first  half  of  2003  year-on-year.  GDP   growth  was  slower  in  the  second  quarter  of  the  year   than  in  the  first  quarter  (6 .2%  and  8.8%  over  the  same   periods in 2002, respectively). Private consumption and  gross  fixed  capital  formation  were  particularly  robust   and became the driving  factors for growth.   GDP components   Private  consumption  is  expect ed  to  continue  to  show   healthy,   but   slightly   lower,   growth   rates   in   2003    compared  to  2002   (6.7%  and  6%  respectively),  as   disposable  income  is  set  to  increase  slightly  less  and   inflation remains at a relatively high level. In 2004 and  2005,  private  consumption  is   expected  to  grow  at  a   slightly lower pace of 5%. Ov erall investment growth is  likely   to   remain   high   at   9.5%   in   2004   and   2005.    Housing   investment   is   increasing   over   the   entire    forecast  period.  The  large  depletion  of  stocks  in  2002   should  come  to  an  end,  but  no  significant  contribution   to GDP growth from stocks is  expected in both forecast  years.  The  outlook  for  the  Latvian  economy  is  for  a  strong   growth rate in 2003 of 6%, declining slightly to 5.7% in  2005.  In  both  years  final  domestic  demand  is  expected   to  be  driving  growth,  prim arily  led  by  increases  in   private consumption on the back of sustained increases  in real disposable income and better credit access. Fixed  investment growth will remain high at 9.5% throughout  the forecast period. External demand will continue to be  important for growth. The recovery of the EU economy  and a further assumed depreciation of the lat against the  euro  will  keep  export  growth  strong.  Import  growth  is   expected  to  slow  down  but  to  remain  robust,  allowing   for a narrowing of the trade balance. Thus, for 2005 the  contribution from net exports will have recovered to -.4  percentage points from –1.5 percentage points in 2003.  Accordingly,  real  GDP  is  ex pected  to  grow   at  around   5.5%, or close to potentia l in both forecast years.  Costs and prices  Despite   high   private   consumption   growth,   inflation    decreased to 2% in 2002, as inflation in Latvia’s major  trading  partners  was  low  and  lower  prices  in  mobile   communication  services  helped  to  contain  domestic   price  pressures.  Inflation  has  picked  up  and  reached   3.5%  in  August  2003.  The  sh arpest  rise  was  seen  by   health   care   costs.   Costs   of   recreation   and   culture,    housing   and   public   utilities   and   foodstuffs   have    increased with only costs of  the communications edging  lower.  Inflation  is  expected  to  grow  steadily  and  stabilise  at   3%  during  the  forecast  period.  Inflation  will  increase   due to the expected adjustment of the price level to the  EU  level  and  due  to  wage  increases.  From  2004,  an   increase in excise duties on fuel and petrol is planned to  be implemented – thus, the inflation rate is expected to  increase  due  to  this  factor   as  well.  However,  the  full   impact of the effect of the increase will only be visible  in the second half of 2004 and 2005, where inflation is  set to increase more rapidly. Core inflation is, however,  not  expected  to  increase   markedly  over  the  forecast   horizon. Labour market   High    growth    has    contributed    to    lowering    the     unemployment  rate,  which  decreased  from  12.8%  in   December  2001  to  11.6%  in  December  2002,  and  the   employment rate was 60.4% in 2002. However, upward  pressure  on  unemployment  from  enterprise  and  rural   restructuring is expected to remain.  In  spite  of  a  strong  growth   performance,  and  sizeable   employment   gains   since   2001,   the   unemployment    rate—which   remains   at   ar ound   12%   of   the   labour    force—is   forecast   to   decline   only   slightly   in   the    medium   term   to   around   11%   of   the   labour   force.    Moderate  employment  gains  of  0.5%  per  year  over  the   forecast  period  will  contribu te  to  the  decline  in  the   unemployment   rate,   although   considerable   regional    development    disparities    will    hold    back    a    faster     improvement in labour market conditions.  The current account Export  growth  in  2002  was  very  strong  despite  the   international  slowdown,  and  imports  grew  somewhat   less  than  exports.  Also,  in  the  beginning  of  2003  trade   continued to be buoyant. Exports increased by 19.2% in  the  first  half  of  2003  over  the  same  period  last  year   while imports increased by 20.4%.   Exports  are  expected  to  gr ow  by  9.4%  on  average  in   2003,  slightly  decreasing  to  9.0%  in  2004  and  2005.   Imports should grow broadly in line with final demand,  resulting   in   a   small   negative   contribution   to   GDP    growth from net exports in both years.  The  current  account  deficit  d ecreased  to  7.8%  of  GDP   in 2002. As the trade balance is expected to worsen, this  will result in a broadening of  the current account deficit  by about 2 percentage points during the forecast period.  Public finances  A  sudden  and  large  increas e  of  public  expenditures   related  to  investment  and  temporary  transfers  at  the   very end of 2002 let the budget deficit increase to 3% of  GDP.  According  to  the  budget  for  2003,  the  general   government  deficit  was  planned  to  be  3%  of  GDP.   However,  better  then  expected  tax  revenues  in  the  first   two  quarters  of  the  year  indicate  that  a  somewhat   smaller deficit is possible. In 2004, a broadening of the  VAT base and the real estate tax base will outweigh the  intended cut in the corporate income tax. Consequently,  the deficit is expected to ap proach 2% of GDP in 2005. 		
November/2003	Lithuania	Strong domestic demand to continue as the leading factor for growth 	The economy   In spite of a weak external  environment, the Lithuanian  economy  remained  particularly  strong  in  2002  and  the   first   half   of   2003 .    Real   GDP   continued   to   grow    unabated   in   2002,   reaching   6.7%,   and   accelerated    further  to  7.7%  year-on-year  in  the  first  half  of  2003.   Output  growth  was  particularly  supported  by  strong   investment  and  private  consumption.  Despite  robust   export  growth  in  2002,  the  contribution  of  net  trade  to   GDP  growth  was  moderate,  as  imports  also  picked  up   strongly.  The  current  account   deficit  increased  slightly   to  5.4%  of  GDP  in  2002.  Strong  productivity  growth,   moderate  wage  inflation,  and  the  large  appreciation  of   the  litas  contributed  to  low  CPI  inflation,  at  0.3%  in   2002.  Consumer  prices  followed  a  decreasing  trend  in   2003 and declined by 1% in  August compar ed with the  same  month  of  2002.  The  unemployment  rate  (Labour   Force  Survey  data)  decreased   from  17.4%  in  2001  to   13.8%   in   2002,   underpinned   by   high   employment    growth.  The  authorities  remained  committed  to  the   fiscal  consolidation  prog ramme,  and  accordingly  the   general  government  deficit  declined  further  to  1.7%  of   GDP in 2002.   Prospects  Output  growth  is  expected  to  remain  robust  throughout   the  forecast  horizon,  in  a   range  of  5.7%-6.6%.  The   pattern  of  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  be  continuously influenced  by  Lithuania’s  accession  to  the  EU,  which   primarily  affects  the  outlook  for  gross  fixed  capital   formation, government expenditure and net trade.  In  the  face  of  increasing  i nvestment  and  consumption,   domestic  demand  is  expected  to  remain  the  leading   factor  for  growth.  The  prospect  for  import  growth,  in   the wake of robust domestic demand, is likely to offset  an  anticipated  strong  export   performance,  leading  to  a   negative contribution of net trade to growth in 2004 and  2005.  GDP components   Private consumption is likely to grow rapidly at around  5%  over  the  forecast  period ,  sustained  by  real  wage   increases  and  high  credit  growth.  Higher  employment   and    increasing    government    expenditure    are    also     expected to stimulate consumption.  Public  consumption  is  projected  to  grow  considerably   in 2004 and 2005, partly reflecting expenditure in goods  and  services  related  to  proj ects  co-financed  by  the  EU.   A  higher  public  wage  bill  is  also  expected,  to  some   extent  reflecting  a  build  up  in  administrative  capacity   for absorption of EU funds within the public sector.  Gross fixed capital formation is expected to continue as  the main source of output growth. Investment growth is  expected  to  moderate  somewhat  this  year  at  8.1%,   edging up to 8.7% by 2005. Higher investment is likely  to  be  supported  by  EU-related  investment  projects,   together  with  low  interest  rates,  increasing  domestic   lending and enhanced economic stability.    The strong appreciating trend of the litas experienced in  2002  and  most  of  2003  is  expected  to  moderate  in   2004-2005.  This  fact,  together  with  a  more  benign   outlook  for  growth  in  Lithuania’s  trading  partners,  is   foreseen  to  increase  foreign  demand  for  Lithuania’s   exports.  Domestic  factors,  such  as  high  productivity   growth and structural reforms, should contribute further  to  strong  export  growth  at   above  7%  over   the  forecast   horizon. Nonetheless, import growth is likely to remain  robust,  reflecting  high  domestic  demand,  and  lead  to  a   negative  contribution  of  net  trade  to  growth  in  2004   and, more marginally, in 2005.  Inflation  Annual average CPI inflation  is expected to be negative  in  2003,  to  a  large  extent   reflecting  the  effect  of  the   appreciation   of   the   litas.   Inflation   is   expected   to    increase   significantly   to   ab out   2.5%   in   2004-2005,    initially      influenced      by      accession-related      tax       adjustments.  Other  factors  could  add  further  pressures   on  prices,  such  as  wage  inflation  in  the  tradable  sector   spilling over to the low-pro ductivity non-tradable sector  and  price  hikes  among  regulated  sectors  and  public   transport.  Accordingly,  wage  pressures  are  likely  to   increase,  although   the  estimated  productivity  growth   level should temper the impact on unit labour costs.  Labour market   The unemployment rate (survey based data) is expected  to  decrease  over  the  forecast   period  from  13%  in  2003   to  10.7%  in  2005.  Job  creation  is  likely  to  continue   increasing, induced by high er economic activity, active  labour market policies and the increase in the retirement  age. Significant structural rigidities in the labour market  are   expected   to   remain    in   the   medium-term,   and    constitutes a risk for the projections.   In particular, measures to  tackle  the  mismatch  between   demand and supply of skills and the low mobility of the  workforce  could  take  a  longer   time  than  expected  to   feed  through,  resulting  on  an  insufficient  capacity  to   offset potential job losses stemming from enterprise and  agricultural restructuring.  Public finances   The  general  government  deficit  is  expected  to  edge  up   to  3.1%  of  GDP  in  2004,  from  1.7%  of  GDP  in  2002.   High  public  investment  grow th,  together  with  current   expenditure  in  the  form  of  contributions  to  the  EU   budget  and  prepayments  of   agricultural  subsidies,  are   expected  to  increase  the  deficit  in  2004.  The  deficit  is   expected  to  decline  again   to  2.7%  of  GDP  in  2005,   assuming that control over expenditure continues. 		
November/2003	Malta	Public finances looser 	The economy in 2002  The  difficult  international  environment  continued  to   unfavourably   affect   Malta’s   economy,   particularly    vulnerable to external economic and geopolitical shocks  given   its   small   size,   large   dependence   on   tourism    revenues   and   the   increasingly   open   nature   of   its    economy.    Weak   external   demand,   stemming   from   the   world    economic slowdown, and a fall in tourist arrivals hit the  Maltese   economy   in   2001   and   2002.   After   the    contraction  in  real  GDP  in   2001,  real  GDP  grew  by   1.2%   in   2002,   led   by   a   recovery   in   private   and    government  consumption,  both  having  grown  2.5%  in   real  terms.  Despite  the  increase  in  investment  in  the   construction  sector  of  7.4%,  retrenchment  of  10.1%  in   investment  in  the  machinery  sector  resulted  in  a  4%   drop in  gross fixed capital formation in 2002.   The    external    sector    impr oved    slightly,    exports     marginally  increasing  by  0.2%  and  imports  falling    by   2.2%  in  2002.  The  curren t  account  deficit  remained   stable at 4.7% of GDP. The  rate of inflation decelerated  to  2.2%  in  2002.  The  inflation  pass-through  of  the   depreciation  of  the  Maltese   lira  against  the  euro  was   moderate  because  domestic  demand  was  subdued.  The   unemployment  rate  increased  to  6.8%  in  December   2002.   Developments   in   th e   private   sector   largely    explain  the  increase,  as  lo w  activity  in  tourism  and   industrial restructuring in manufacturing  accounted  for   significant  job  losses.  The  general  government  deficit   decreased to 6.2% of GDP in 2002 from 6.8% in 2001,  but  remains  well  above  the  levels  previously  estimated   by the government. As a result, the debt ratio increased  to 64.2% of GDP, from 62% of GDP in 2001.   Prospects  The   economic   situation   at   the   beginning   of   2003    deteriorated  compared  to  the  end  of  last  year,  and   remarkably high public consumption could offer only a  partial   compensation.   Growth   in   the   first   quarter    contracted by 1.6% but expanded by 0.9% in the second  quarter   (q-o-q)   driven   by   high   gross   fixed   capital    formation  and  government  expenditure.  This  trend  is   estimated  to  consolidate  in  the  second  half  of  the  year.   An  important  driving  force  is  the  expected  gradual   recovery of the technological  sector in the United States  and   in   Asia   that   may   positively   affect   exports.    Furthermore higher tourism earnings in the summer and  strong   growth   of   public   expenditure   related   to   the    construction   sector   will   positively   affect   growth.    Underlying the projection for the Maltese economy is a  progressive,   albeit   slow,   resumption   of   real   GDP    growth  as  efforts  for  deeper  structural  reforms  and   consolidation  of  public  finances  and  debt  reduction   could  weight  on  economic  activity  in  the  short  term.   Accordingly,  real  GDP  growth   is  expected  to  go  up  to   0.8%  in  2003  and  2.7%  and  2.9%  in  2004  and  2005   respectively, mostly supported by exports of goods and  services and gross fixed capital formation.  GDP components   Domestic  impulses  are  likely   to  weaken  as  growth  in   household  consumption  is  projected  to  remain  below   the  rates  observed  in  2 001  and  2002,  because  real   wages   per   head   and   real   disposable   income   are    expected  to  increase  only  moderately  over  the  period.   After  a  sharp  rise  in  public  consumption  in  2003,  this   component  is  expected  to  dramatically  slowdown  in   2004  and  2005,  in  order  to  bring  public  deficit  under   control.  The  main  contribution  to  the  recovery  should   come  from  improvements  in   the  external  sector,  where   exports, after an expected re vival to 2.5% in 2003 , are  forecast  to  increase  by  3.5%  and  3.9%  in  2004  and   2005.  Fixed  investment,  albeit  at  lower  levels  than   previously      due   to   lower   levels   of   public   capital    expenditure,  is  estimated  to  remain  growing  at  close  to           3% in 2004-2005 Costs and prices  Consumer  price  inflation  is  expected  to  stay  below  2%   over  the  period  provided  wage  moderation,  especially   in   the   public   sector,   is   maintained.   Due   to   the    underlying  assumptions  for  world  primary  commodity   prices, oil prices and the exch ange  rate  of  the  euro,  the   contribution  of  imported  inflation  to  consumer  price   increases is expected to remain at the low risk side.  Labour market   Employment  growth  of    0.4%  is  expected  in  2003  and   2004,  but  a  doubling  to  0.8%  is  foreseen  by  the  end  of   the    forecast    period.    The    survey-based    rate    of     unemployment  is  predicted  to  decline  to  7%  in  2003   and further improve over the period, due to job creation  in  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors  which  will  offset   the effects of continued downsizing in the public sector  enterprises.  Public finances   The  fiscal  policy  stance  has  l oosened  considerably  this   year. The general government deficit will likely further  deteriorate  to  7.6%  of  GDP  in  2003,  stemming  from   lower than expected GDP growth in 2003 and mounting   public expenditure linked to outlays connected with the  new Mater Dei Hospital,  and high mandatory and quasi  mandatory  expenditures.  The   expected  budgetary    path   relies,   not   only   heavily   on   developments   in   GDP    growth,   the   effects   of   population   ageing   and   the    requirement  of  co-financing  of  EU  funds,  but  also  on   the government's ability to effectively slowdown public  expenditure.  In  line  with  this   evolution,  the  forecast  is   for  a  general  government  deficit  of  5.8%  in  2004  and   4.1% in 2005. As a result, the general government gross  debt  ratio  is  estimated  to  attain  66.4%  of  GDP  in  2003   and will likely reach 69.4% in  2004 and 70.6% of GDP  in 2005.		
November/2003	Poland	Accelerating growth amidst fiscal and labour market difficulties 	Current situation and prospects  Poland  is  experiencing  a   gradual  recovery  after  two   years of slow growth.  Real  GDP growth accelerated to  3.8%  year-on-year  in  the  second  quarter  of  2003  from   2.2%  in  the  first  quarter.  So  far,  the  recovery  has  been   mainly  driven  by  net  exports,  despite  weak  growth  in   Poland's  main  trading  partners.  Private  consumption,   although  growing  moderately,  has  also  continued  to   support  GDP  growth.  Rapid  expansion  in  industrial   production  and  retail  sales  from  July  to  September   suggests  that  th e  pace  of  growth remained  sustained  in   the third quarter of 2003. The current recovery is helped  by an accommodating fiscal po licy and more favourable  monetary   conditions,   resulting   from   the   easing   of    monetary  policy  and  the  sharp  depreciation  of  the  real   effective exchange rate.   Real  GDP  growth  is  project ed  to  accelerate  gradually   from  3.3%  in  2003  to  4.8%  in  2005.  Growth  will  be   supported  by  domestic  demand,  while  the  contribution   of  net  exports  will  turn  negative  from  2004  onwards.   Boosted  by  increasing  corporate  profits,  an  improving   economic  outlook  and  accession  to  the  EU,  investment   is  expected  to  become  the  driving  force  of  domestic   demand  in  2004.  In  addition,  the  loosening  of  fiscal   policy next year will provide an impetus to growth.  GDP components  After   the   sharp   decline   of   the   past   two   years, investment  is  expected  to  start  growing  again  in  the   second  half  of  2003,  reflecting  improving  company   profitability. However, the recession in the construction  sector  and  still  difficult  financing  conditions  for  firms   will  limit  the  recovery  in  investment  activity  this  year.   As  the  business  climate  improves,  investment  growth   will  gradually  gain  momentum  and  is  projected  to   reach, in volume term s, 11.5% in 2005.   Private  consumption  is  expected  to  remain  relatively   strong  in  2003  despite  rising  unemployment.  Higher   than  planned  increases  in  social  transfers  and  wages  in   real  terms  as  well  as  a  vigorous  grey  economy  will   support    household    spending    this    year.    Growing     consumer  confidence  and  th e  increase  in  employment   should  lead  to  faster  cons umer  spending  in  2004  and   2005.  Export  growth  is  expected  to  remain  robust,   helped by the real effective  depreciation of the zloty in  2003  and  the  productivity  gains  of  Polish  companies.   Import growth will rise in parallel with the acceleration  of  domestic  demand  and  is  projected  to  outpace  export   growth in 2005.  Labour market, costs and prices  In  2003,  the  rise  in  unemployment  will  reflect  both   demographic   factors   and   a   drop   in   employment.    Significant job losses will be associated with continued  enterprise  restructuring,  notably  in  agriculture  and  in   the coal mining and steel sect ors. A modest increase in  employment is expected in  2004 and 2005 as economic  activity       gathers       momentum.       However,       the        unemployment   rate   would   start   decreasing   only   in    2005.  Inflationary  pressures  will  remain  subdued  in  2003,  as   domestic      demand      remains      weak      and      high       unemployment  restrains  wage  pressures.  As  a  result,   headline   inflation   at   the   end   of   2003   will   likely    undershoot the lower band of the target range set by the  Polish   National   Bank   (3%   +/-   1%). The   forecast    foresees  a  gradual  increase  in  inflation  from  the  very   low level of 0.7% on average in 2003 to 2.7% in 2005. The  inflationary  push  will   come  from  the  acceleration   of  domestic  demand,  the  pass-through  of  the  currency   depreciation and a small infla tionary effect of accession  linked to tax increases.    External accounts  The current account deficit is set to narrow further this  year  as  a  result  of  strong  export  growth  and  weak   imports. The recovery should entail a gradual widening  of  the  current  account  deficit  from  2.9%  of  GDP  in   2003  to  3.6%  in  2005.  Higher  transfers  from  the  EU   will   contribute   to   limiting   the   deterioration   of   the    current  account  balance  in  2004  and  2005. Thus,  over   the  forecast  horizon,  the  current  account  deficit  will   remain  at  levels  that  can  be  easily  financed  by  foreign   direct investment and portfolio inflows.   Public finances  In 2003, the deficit would increase to 4.3 % of GDP in  ESA 95 terms from 3.9% in 2002. The forecast includes  provisionally  the  surplus  of  the  open  pension  funds,   which  is  expected  to  reach  approx.  1.7%  of  GDP  this   year, but whose classification  remains to be decided.   In 2004, notwithstanding the strengthening of economic  growth,  the  investment  rec overy  and  the  increase  of   private consumption, the general government balance is  projected  to  increase  substa ntially  to  5.9%  of  GDP,   reflecting  additional  spending  pressures  arising  from   accession.  Revenues  are  set  to  decrease  following  the   implementation   of   a   tax   reform,   which   lowers   the    corporate  income  tax  rate.   Under  the  no-policy-change   assumption,  the  fiscal  adjust ment  in  the  election  year   2005  would  be  mainly  cyclical  with  a  positive  role   played  by  the  disbursement  of  structural  funds.  It  is   projected  that  the  deficit  will  fall  to  4.9%  of  GDP  in   2005.   The   medium-term   fiscal   strategy   announced    recently  by  the  government   and  complemented  by  the   programme of expenditure cuts (the so-called Hausner’s  plan) might further contribute to lowering the deficit to  some  limited  degree  in  2005 .  However,  this  forecast   does not take into account the  fiscal reform plan, as the  measures  have  not  yet  been  adopted.  The  gross  debt   ratio,  which  would  stand  at  45.1%  of  GDP  in  2003,  is   expected to increase to above 51% by the end of 2005. 		
November/2003	Slovakia	Keeping up strong growth 	Growth in 2002 and in the first half of 2003   In 2002, real GDP growth a ccelerated to 4.4%. Like in  the  year  before,  domestic  demand  has  been  the  main   growth engine – owing to a strong expansion in private  and  public  consumption.  Private  consumption  was  in   particular  driven  by  an  exceptionally  high  real  wage   increase.  Public  consumpti on  reflected  the  electoral   cycle. Gross fixed investment  contracted slightly after a  very  strong  expansion  in  2001.  The  contribution  to   GDP growth by net exports was minor.    In  the  first  half  of  2003,  growth  slowed  down  to  3.9%   and its composition turned around. The contribution by  domestic demand (excluding stocks) fell to almost zero.  Both  public  and  private  consumption  were  dampened   significantly  by  fiscal  rest raint  and  administered  price   adjustments. Gross fixed capital formation fell. In spite  of the lacklustre performance of Slovakia’s main export  markets  and  reflecting  the   creation  of  significant  new   export  capacity,  exports  of   goods  and  services  rose   strongly by 22.8%,  outpacing import growth of 15.8%  and  leading  to  a  net  external  contribution  to  GDP   growth of 5.1 percentage points.   Growth prospects  The immediate outlook for the Slovak economy is for a  continuation  of  sustained  growth  performance  for  the   rest of 2003, leading to an annual  growth rate of 3.8%.  The growth composition should basically stay the same  as in the first half of the year, although the contribution  of  domestic  demand  is  foreseen  to  become  positive  as   well,  based,   inter  alia,   on  a  pick-up  in  gross  fixed   capital formation during the rest of the year.  As  for  2004  and  2005,  growth  is  predicted  to  steadily   accelerate    to    4.3%,    with    all    domestic    demand     components  making  an  increasing  contribution  and  net   exports   becoming   the   junior,   but   still   significant,    growth contributor.   Inflation  CPI headline inflation reached a record low of 3.3% in  2002   –   down      from   over   7%   in   2001.   As   the    government continues to adjust administered prices and  indirect  taxes,  headline  inflation  in  2003  and  2004  is   likely  to  surge  back  to  over  8%.  In  the  first  half  of   2003,   it   averaged   at   7.8% .   Core   inflation,   which    excludes these effects, averaged at 2.3%.  Assuming  that  second  round  effects  are  kept  under   control,  a  rapid  disinflation  leading  to  an  inflation  rate   of around 5% in 2005 should be possible.   Current Account  Mainly  dominated  by  trade  developments,  the  current   account deficit narrowed subs tantially from over 8% of  GDP  in  2002  to  slightly  below  5%  in  the  12  months   until  June  2003.  Foreign  trade  developments  should   again be the main factor behind a further narrowing this  year  and  a  current  account   deficit  of  around  4½%  of   GDP in 2004 and 2005, as Slovakia further expands its  export capacity. Labour market   Real wages rose significantly in 2002 (by around 6% on  a  CPI  basis),  as  nominal  wage  increases  were  not  kept   in  line  with  the  low  inflation.  In  the  first  half  of  2003,   real  wages  decreased  by  roughly  1½%.  Unemployment   is  slowly  but  steadily  falling.  It  amounted  to  18.6%  in   2002 and to 17.7% in the first half of 2003.   In    spite    of    continuing    enterprise    restructuring,     unemployment  is  set  for  a  slow  but  steady  further   decline  to  around  16½%  by  2005  –  the  main  reason   being  a  more  decisive  policy  stance  in  tackling  the   deep-seated structural  unemployment problem.  Public finances   Approximating     ESA95     standards,     the     general      government deficit reached 7. 2% of GDP in the election  year 2002.   After  the  elections  in  Sept ember  2002,  the  new  Slovak   government has initiated a fiscal turn-around, aiming at  a  general  government  deficit  target  of  5%  of  GDP  for   2003.   To   this   end,   the   government   has   already    advanced  excise  tax  increases  from  the  beginning  of   2004  to  August  2003,  in   the  face  of  emerging  budget   execution risks. In 2004, a fa r-reaching tax reform will  be  implemented,  consisting  mainly  of  the  introduction   of a flat income tax rate and a unified value added tax,  both  at  19%.  Estimates    suggest  that  the  tax  reform  is   likely   to   be   broadly   revenue-neutral.   Against   this    backdrop,   it   is   projected   th at   the   government   will       basically  meet  its  deficit  target  of  3.9%  of  GDP  for   2004 and will reduce the deficit further to around 3½%  of GDP in 2005.   Risks   to   this   scenario   stem   in   particular   from   the    fundamental nature of the tax reforms,  which make any  revenue   forecast   uncertain   and   which   are   not   yet    matched  with  the  same  degree  of  precision  as  regards   substance and sequencing of  corresponding expenditure  reforms.   Furthermore,   the   introduction   of   a   funded    pension pillar, which is considered for 2005, would add  roughly  1%  to  that  year’s  deficit  unless  compensating   measures    are    taken    –    like    for    instance    further     parametric reforms of the pay-as-you-go pillar. 		
November/2003	Slovenia	Steady and balanced growth despite 	The economy in 2002  Slovenia      has      generally      performed      well      in       macroeconomic    terms    and    achieved    stable    GDP     growth;  rates  have  been  steady  at  3-5%  since  1993.  In   2002,   growth   reached   2.9%,   driven   by   domestic    demand,  which  was  mostly  fed  by  revived  investment,   while  household  and  government  consumption  stayed   subdued.  Stronger  domestic  demand  in  turn  stimulated   import growth. The net external demand contribution to  growth  declined  as  weak  EU   markets,  the  main  trade   area  for  Slovenia,  put  downward  pressure  on  export   expansion.  Nevertheless,  total  export  growth remained  relatively  dynamic  thanks  to  continued  market  gains   outside the EU, notably Russia and the Balkans.  Robust  real  export  growth  combined  with  improved   terms of trade led to a shar p improvement in the current  account.  In  2002,   the  current  account   surplus  rose  to   1.7% of GDP, the highest level since 1994. At the same  time,  the  usually  low  inward  foreign  direct  investment   flows  reached  record  levels   at  8.3%  of  GDP,  mostly   linked  to  privatisation  in  banking  and  pharmaceuticals,   constituting the main part of capital inflows in 2002.  Prospects  For  this  year,  th e  forecast  projects  a  deceleration  in   GDP   growth   to   2.1%   despite   especially   buoyant    domestic consumption driving the economy. Next year,  GDP  growth  should  accelerate  to  3.1%  as  domestic   demand  strengthens  and  export  growth  picks  up  with   revived  EU  growth.  All  components  should  push  GDP   growth in 2005, with domestic demand giving the main  impetus. GDP components  Both consumption and investment demand this year are  foreseen  to  recover,  increasing  by  2.3%  and  5.2%,   respectively.  Consumer  and   investor  confidence  have   been rising despite sluggish real wage and employment  growth.  Next  year,  a  modest  upturn  is  projected  with   consumption  and  investment  picking  up  against  the   background  of  EU  accession,  market  competition  and   enterprise restructuring, increasing exports, and a boost  in construction investment stimulated by released funds  from the national housing saving scheme. Exports   will   expand   only   marginally   in   2003,   as    external  demand  from  the  EU  is  weak  while  the  high   export  growth  to  markets  of  former  Yugoslavia,  CIS,   and  CEFTA,  slowly  fades.  For  the  remaining  forecast   period,    export    growth    is    expected    to    accelerate     somewhat.  Import  growth  is  also  set  to  rise  slightly,  in   step  with  strengthened  domestic  (investment)  demand   and exports. Overall, the cu rrent account surplus slowly  erodes by 2005.  Costs and prices  Although  inflation  has  been  inching  downward,  its   persistency remains a concern. For 2002, inflation stood  at  7.5%,  down  from  8.6%  in  2001.  In  the  course  of   2003  some  further  declin e  was  registered,  reaching   6.3% by August. This development is more attributable  to  special  factors  (such  as   caps  on  administered  price   rises  and  excise  tax  changes)   than  to  a  co-ordinated   policy to lower inflation on a sustained basis. A steady  depreciation   of   the   currency   continues   to   add   to    inflationary    pressures.    However,    backward-looking     indexation  mechanisms  have  been  weakened.  After  de- indexation of interest rates, a wage agreement for public  sector  wages  was  concluded  in  July  2003  limiting   backward-looking  indexation  and  taking  into  account   EU  inflation  and  the  euro/tolar  exchange  rate.  For  the   private  sector,  such  an  arrangement  yet  needs  to  be negotiated.    Still,    wage    policy    seems    to    have     successfully  kept  real  wage   rises  below  productivity   growth.  For  this  year,  inflation  is  projected  at  5.9%   while  a  further  decline  to  4.3%  is  envisaged  in  2005,   based   on   a   further   de-indexation   of   the   economy,    although there are risks.  The prime objective of the Bank of Slovenia (BoS) is to  pursue  price  stability.  This  has  proven  hard  to  achieve.   Furthermore,   M3   growth   repeatedly   overshoots   the    band  targets.  In  2002,  M3  achieved  slightly  lower   growth  but  with  23%,  again  surpassed  the  upper  limit   set  at  18%,  providing  room  for  inflation  to  persist.  M3   growth  in  the  first  half  of  2003  has  been  more  limited,   standing  at  16%  y-o-y  in  June  2003.  Like  last  year,   monetary  expansion  is  partly  a  result  of  high  capital   inflows, prompting the BoS to attempt to sterilise these  flows.   Labour market  Employment    fell    marginally    in    2002    while    the     unemployment  rate  remained  stable  at  6%.  This  year   the prospects for the labour market remain gloomy with  employment  decreasing  and  unemployment  increasing.   In  2004,  the  unemployment  rate  is  to  return  to  past   levels of slightly above 6% and then resume its gradual  trend decline as GDP growth strengthens. Public finances  General    government    budget    deficits    have    been     relatively    small.    Nevertheless,    there    have    been     unexpected      shortfalls,      leading      to      budgetary       overshooting    and    the    repeated    introduction    of     supplementary  budgets  in  r ecent  years.  In   2002,  the   deficit rose by 0.6 percentage  points more than planned,  to   2.4%   of   GDP.   With   direct   tax   reform   and    expenditure  limits,  the  deficit  for  this  year  is  projected   to   decline   marginally   to   2.2%   of   GDP   and   then decrease further to 1.8% and 1.7% of GDP in 2004 and  2005, respectively.  Wages  constitute  an  important  part   of   general   government   spending   and   the   recent    agreement on public sector wa ges is expected to contain  budget expenditures. 		
November/2003	Bulgaria	Catching up on the basis of strong domestic demand 	The economy in 2003   Following  three  consecutive  y ears  of  real  GDP  growth   above  4%,  catching-up  continued  at  a  rate  of  4.1%  in   the  first  half  of  2003.  Growth  is  based  on  domestic   demand,    in    particular    private    consumption    and     investment,     arising     from     strong     increases     in      employment,  net  income  and  bank  credit.  While  net   exports had a slightly positive contribution to growth of  0.1%  in  2002,  there  was  a  strong  negative  contribution   of almost 4% in the first half of 2003.   Consumer  price  inflation  has  declined  further  from   5.8%  on  annual  average  in  2002  to  1.6%  on  average   until  September  2003,  mostly  resulting  from  low  food   prices and low import prices following the depreciation  of  the  US  dollar.  Registered  unemployment  decreased   to  13.0%  in  August  2003  and  is  about  4½  percentage   points lower than one year ear lier due to jobs created in  the    private    sector    and    government    employment     schemes.  The  current  account  deficit  was  at  4.7%  of   GDP in 2002, considerably lower than in 2001, when it  stood at 6.1% of GDP. However, it increased to 5.0% of  forecast GDP until July 2003  because of higher deficits  in the trade and income balances. Net inflows of foreign  direct  investment  in  2002  amounted  to  about  3.1%  of   GDP,  almost  the  same  as  in  the  first  half  of  2003  at   estimated 2.7% of forecast GDP.   Prospects  Growth  of  real  GDP  is  expected  to  amount  to  4½%  in   2003 and to accelerate to rates of 5% in 2004 and 5½%  in  2005.  This  will  be  due  to  an  improving  external   environment, in particular in  the EU as its main trading  partner,  as  well  as  the  continuation  of  an  economic   policy  oriented  towards  macroeconomic  stability  and   structural reforms.   While  GDP  growth  is  expected   to  be  rather  steady,  its   composition  shows  some  vari ation  over  the  forecasting   horizon.  Private  consumption  will  be  very  strong  in   2003 because of high credit growth, higher employment  and increases in real income above productivity growth  due to the unexpectedly low  inflation. These effects are  likely  to  moderate  somewhat   in  2004,  but  accelerating   investment   in   view   of   the   business   opportunities    expected from EU accession and some fiscal loosening  could  stimulate  domestic  demand  further  in  2005.  Net   exports  are  forecast  to  have   a  contribution  of  –3.5%  in   2003, -1.2% in 2004 and –1.9% in 2005.  Inflation   Consumer  price  inflation  in  the  second  half  of  2003  is   expected  to  be  higher  than  in  the  first  half,  mainly   arising  from  increases  in   administered  and  regulated   prices,  and  could  reach  3.3%   at  the  end  of  the  year.  If   wage  increases  remain  moderate,  average  inflation  is   likely  to  have  rates  of  3½%  in  2004  and  4%  in  2005,   mostly due to catching-up e ffects for service prices and  increases  in  administered  pr ices  and  indirect  taxes  to   implement  commitments  undertaken  in  the  accession   negotiations.   Labour markets   In    view    of    continuing    high    GDP    growth,    net     employment  gains  of  1½%  per  year  in  2004  and  2005   would  make  it  possible  to  achieve  an  unemployment   rate   of   about   12.3%   in   2005   since   the   induced    increasing  participation  rate  is  likely  to  be  offset  by  a   declining share of the working-age population.   Public finances   For   2003,   the   forecast   assumes   that   the   general    government  deficit  target  of  0.7%  of  GDP  will  be   revised  towards  a  balanced  budget  in  order  to  avoid  a   substantial fiscal expansion at the end of the year given  the  revenue  over  performance  until  August  2003  with   an accumulated budget surplus (in cash terms) of more  than 2% of forecast GDP. Th e expected deficit in 2004  of 0.7% of GDP is in line with the medium-term fiscal  framework as presented in the Pre-accession Economic  Programme  2003.  However,  the  election  year  2005   could see a limited widening of the budget deficit to 1%  of  GDP  and  less  wage  discipline.  The  government’s   commitment  to  reducing  the  expenditure-to-GDP  ratio   implies  that  public  consumption  should  expand  less   than  GDP.  The  continuation  of  running  a  high  primary   surplus and of high GDP growth will further reduce the  debt-to-GDP  ratio  to  belo w  50%  over  the  forecasting   horizon.  External balance  The deficit of the trade bala nce is expected to decrease  from 10.9% of GDP in 2003 to 10.0% of GDP in 2004,  but  to  increase  again  to  10 .4%  in  2005  as  a  result  of   strong domestic demand and the high import content of   fixed investment because of the rather limited domestic  production of investment goods and intermediate goods.   The  substantial  difference   between  trade  and  current   account  deficit  arises  from   high  positive  net  exports  of   services,  in  particular  tourism,  as  well  as  positive  net   current transfers. The current account deficit is forecast  to  increase  above  6%  of  GDP  in  2003  and  just  below   6% of GDP in 2004, but could widen again in 2005 as a  result  of  strong  domestic  demand  and  less  favourable   terms  of  trade.  FDI  could  be  at  record  levels  in  2003   and  2004  related  to  both  greenfield  investment  and   privatisation.  However,  privatisation  is  planned  to  be   finalised  until  the  end  of  2004  so  that  FDI  might  be   lower and be mainly related to greenfield investment in  2005. 		
November/2003	Romania	A weakening current ac count accompanies domestic  driven growth and  further disinflation  	The economy in 2003   Growth slowed down somewhat but remained robust in  2003   as   the   economic   rec overy   entered   its   fourth    consecutive  year.  Real  GDP   growth  equalled  4.9%  in   2002   and   4.3%   in   the   first   half   of   2003   but   its    composition  changed  as  do mestic  demand  accelerated   and    the    external    balance    deteriorated.    In    2002,     household consumption growth slowed down to 3% and  net exports contributed positively to growth for the first  time  in  the  current  upswing.  During  the  first  half  of   2003,  instead,  household  consumption  growth  picked   up again, rising by 5.4% on an annual basis, on the back  of  sharply  rising  net  wages  and  booming  consumer   credit.  With  investment  spending  also  continuing  to   increase   apace   at   7.8%,   import   growth   remained    sustained    at    13.1%.    At    11.3%,    export    growth     decelerated  causing  the  cont ribution  of  net  exports  to   growth to turn negative again.  As  a  result  of  these  trends ,  the  current  account  deficit   began  widening  again  in  2003.  After  dropping  sharply   to  3.5%  of  GDP  in  2002,  by  July  2003,  the  cumulative   current account deficit over the previous twelve months  rose   to   an   estimated   4.3%    of   GDP.   However,   the    process of sustained and gradual disinflation that started  in   late   1999   continued.   After   falling   to   17.8%   by    December  2002  against  an  offi cial  target  of  22%,  the   year-on-year   inflation   rate   declined   to   15.9%   in    September 2003.  Prospects  The  immediate  outlook  fo r  the  Romanian  economy   points      to      sustained      growth,      broadly      stable       unemployment  and  declining  inflation.  Relative  to  the   Spring 2003 forecast, a wors ened external situation and  a  sharper  acceleration  in  domestic  demand  justify  an   upward revision in the project ed current account deficit.  Following  a  tightening  of  policies  over  the  second  half   of  2003,  the  forecast  scen ario  assumes  the  ongoing   acceleration of domestic demand will be kept in check.  However,  given  the  planned  relaxation  of  the  fiscal   stance  and  the  uncertainties  surrounding  the  planned   concomitant  reduction  in  the  quasi-fiscal  deficit,  risks   are clearly on the downside.   GDP growth and components   After  totalling  4.6%  in  2003,  projected  GDP  growth  is   expected  to  accelerate  slightly  on  the  back  of  domestic   demand. Rising real incomes and increasing availability  of  credit  will  underpin  a  strong  growth  of  household   consumption  while  investment  spending  grows  at  an   accelerating  pace  thanks  to  higher  capital  outlays  by   both   the   private   and   public   sectors.   Exports,   are    expected to continue expanding rapidly thanks to strong  productivity   gains   and   a   strengthening   recovery   in    Romania's EU markets.  Howe ver, with strong domestic  demand  supporting  imports  growth,  the  contribution  of   net exports to GDP growth is projected to turn negative  again from 2003 onwards.   Inflation  Despite  significant  increases  in  energy  tariffs  at  the   beginning  of  September,  CPI  inflation  is  projected  to   continue  declining,  dropping  to  14.0%  year-on-year  by   end-2002, and reaching single  digit levels by end-2004  as the central bank gradually lowers the rate of nominal  depreciation of the exchange rate. Largely as a result of  a  sharp  increase  in  the  mi nimum  wage  and  a  cut  in   employee’s rate for social secu rity contribution, real net  wages increased by 8.7% in the first eight months of the  year  compared  to  the  corr esponding  period  in  2002.   Albeit lower, wage growth is projected to remain robust  in   2004   and   2005   due   to   further   minimum   wage    increases and strong productivity gains Labour market   Statistical revisions significantly affect the behaviour of  labour  market  indicators  in  2004,  as  well  as  during  the   current     year.     Continued     labour     shedding     by      restructuring  enterprises  is  expected  to  moderate  the   positive effects of sustained economic growth on labour  demand.   Against   the   background   of   a   declining    population and very slight rises in the participation rate,  the unemployment rate is projected to remain relatively  low.  Public finances   Despite   lower   than   planned   revenues,   the   general    government deficit only amounted to 0.6% of GDP over  the   first   seven   months   of   the   year.   This   prudent    implementation of the 2003 budget and the adoption of  a revised budget compensating for the revenue shortfall  and accommodating for additional spending to advance  structural  reform  imply  that  the  2.7%  of  GDP  general   government deficit target should be easily met.   As  of  2004,  however,  net  borrowing  by  the  general   government will increase to 3%  of GDP, largely due to  a further cut in the social security contribution rate, the  introduction  of  a  reduced  VAT  rate  and  a  rise  in   transfers  linked  to  enterprise  restructuring.  Gross  debt,   however,   is   projected   to   remain   roughly   stable   at    around 21.5% of GDP.  External balance   Romania’s  external  position   is  projected  to  weaken  on   the    back    of    a    widening    trade    deficit.    Despite     continuously   strong   export   growth,   in   fact,   robust    domestic demand is projected to pull in imports of both  consumer  and  capital  goods.  Coupled  with  a  slight   worsening  in  net  factor  income  from  abroad,  this  will   cause  the  current  account  deficit  to  rise  throughout  the   period.  However,  the  continued  improvement  in  the   service  trade  balance  and  the  steady,  albeit  gradual,   increase  in  transfers  from  abroad  are  projected  to  limit     the extent of the external deterioration.  		
April/2004	Cyprus	Continued  moderate  growth  and  fiscal  slippage  in  2003,  renewed  fiscal   consolidation efforts to start in 2004 	The situation in 2003   In  2003  the  decline  in  tourist  arrivals  continued,  as  a   result  of  the  Iraq  war,  SARS,  and  low  EU  growth.   GDP  growth  in  2003  is  therefore  estimated  at  a   m odest  2%,  similar  to  2002.  From  July  onward  a   gradual  restrained  recovery  seems  to  be  on  the  way,   with  Q3  and  Q4  growth  at  2-2.5%.  The  expansion   continued   to   be   domestic-demand   led,   notably   in    construction        investment        and        government         consumption,  as  fiscal  policy  remained  expansionary   and  the  government  deficit  widened.  Consumption   growth  was  modest  at  1.5%  in  2003,  following  real   wage  growth,  although  disposable  income  increased   due  to  tax  reform  and  continuing  full-employment   conditions,   and   consumer   confidence   picked   up    somewhat.   Investment   declined   by   nearly   3.0%,    although  when  corrected  for  ships/aircraft  purchases   in  2002,  growth  would  still  be  above  4%,  while   construction  investment  remained  buoyant.  Demand   was supported by lower interest rates after the Central  Bank  of  Cyprus  (CBC)  lowered  rates  by  50  points  to   4.5%  in  April  2003  which,  together  with  somewhat   higher inflation rates, reduced real interest rates.  Following  a  10%  decline  in  2002,  tourist  arrivals   dropped  a  further  5%  in  2003  (although  stabilising   from  the  UK,  Cyprus’  largest  market).  Total  export   growth was marginal while imports declined. Overall,  and with slightly improved terms of trade, the current  account deficit reached 4.4% of GDP, below the 2002  level  but  still  relatively  high  and  therefore  remaining   a potential concern. Prospects in 2004 and 2005   After  a  difficult  international  environment  in  2001- 2003,   contributing   to   low   growth   and   increasing    economic   imbalances   in   Cyprus,   the   outlook   is    cautiously   positive.   Tourist   arrivals   should   revive    gradually in 2004-5, in line with historical experience  and  reflecting  global  recovery  and  a  positive  spill- over  of  the  2004  Olympic  Games  in  Athens.  For   2004,  GDP  growth  is  projected  to  climb  to  3.4%,   strengthening  further  in  2005  to  4.1%,  as  external   demand  picks  up.  Investment growth  should  recover,   encouraged    by    EU    accession,    liberalisation    in     financial   and   utilities   markets,   and   infrastructure    projects (airports in Larnaca and Paphos and a port in  Larnaca),  while  consumption  growth  strengthens  in   line  with  real  wage  development.  Domestic  private   demand  therefore  remains  a  driving  force,  although   fiscal   consolidation   is   expected   to   put   downward    pressure  on  total  domestic  demand.  Higher  domestic   demand  will  stimulate  import  growth  but  the  revival   in  tourism  exports  and  fiscal  consolidation  should   bring  a  lower  current  account  deficit.  Overall  the   forecast  projects  a  decrease  in  the  current  account   deficit in 2004 and 2005 to around 3.6% of GDP.     It  must  be  noted  that  these  projections  are  subject  to   unusual  uncertainty:  negotiations  for  a  settlement  of   the  Cyprus  problem  restarted  in  early  2004.  In  the   event  of  reunification  the  island’s  economic  situation   would fundamentally change.   Labour market, costs and prices   Wi th relatively   low   growth   continuing   in   2003,    unemployment rose slightly to 4.4%, up from 3.9% in  2002.  The  relatively  flexible  labour  market,  linked  to   the  service  economy,  has  held  up  well  and  continued   to  operate  at  near  full-employment  levels.  For  this   year  and  next  unemployment  is  expected  to  inch   lower again as GDP growth picks up.  The peg to the euro with a closely managed monetary  policy  and  relatively  low  wage  pressures  have  been   among  the  main  factors  keeping  inflation  in  check.   Prices  in  2002  and  2003  were  mainly  pushed  by   higher   VAT   taxation   related   to   EU   accession.    Inflation reached 2.8% in 2002 and climbed to 4% for  2003  (lower  than  originally  expected)  but  is  foreseen to   drop   back   to   about   2%   for   2004   and   2005,    following  similar  VAT-hikes  and  inflation  paths  in   the  past;  it  stood  at  1.4%  y-o-y  in  February  2004.  In   November    2003,    following    publication    of    an     academic paper containing a citizen’s opinion survey,  newspaper   articles   discussing   devaluation   of   the    pound  appeared  in  the  Cyprus  press.  However,  such   speculation  was  strongly  rejected  by  the  CBC  while   the    pound    remained    stable    vis-à-vis    the    euro     throughout.  Real  wage  increases  in  2002  exceeded   productivity   growth   but   are   estimated   to   have    remained  below  the  latter  for  2003  (1%  and  1.5%   respectively).  For  2004-2005  real  wage  increases  are   expected to remain at or below productivity growth.  Public finance  After   slipping   in   2002,   fiscal   consolidation   went    further    awry    in    2003    and    the    consolidation     programme  was  effectively  abandoned  in  the  course   of   the   year.   Increased   spending   through   higher    defence  outlays  and  expansionary  measures  to  offset   subdued   external   demand   plus   revenue   shortfalls    linked  to  low  growth  and  tax  avoidance  led  to  a   government deficit of 6.3% of GDP, even higher than  the    5.2%    Autumn    forecast.    The    new    fiscal     consolidation  plan  adopted  in  September  2003  no   longer targets a budget balance over the medium term  (and was in the meantime revised upward). Even then,  considerable    corrective    measures    are    required.     Positively,   investment   will   not   be   cut   back.   The    quality  of  public  finances  should  improve  due  to   public   finance   reform   to   be   finished   end-2004.    Measures  will  then  be  in  place  to  improve  revenues   (e.g.  increasing  government  service  fees,  reinforcing   of  tax  compliance)  and  expenditures  (reduction  of   military  outlays,  agricultural  subsidies,  containment   of public sector wages). The forecast is for a gradually  declining  -but  still  relatively  high-  deficit  of  4.6%  of   GDP  for  2004  and  4.1%  of  GDP  by  2005,  somewhat   above the government targets. 		
April/2004	Czech Republic	Worrying dynamics of public debt 	The economy in 2003  In  2003,  real  GDP  growth  was  strong  reaching   2.9%,  as  compared  to  2.2%  in  the  Commission’s   autumn  2003  forecast.  The  main  driving  force  of   economic growth was private consumption (mainly  by  households)  and  exports.  Private  consumption   grew  by  5.4%,  which  was  unexpected  given  the   rising  unemployment  rate.  Exports  grew  by  6.7%   which  was  also  above  expectations  as  the  external   environment     remained     difficult.     Government      consumption stagnated in 2003 (0.0%).  Buoyant   household   consumption   was   mainly   a    result  of  the  combination  of  an  increase  in  real   disposable income and of low nominal interest rates  that  enabled  an  expansion  of  consumer  credit.  The   growth  rate  of  gross  fixed  capital  formation  was   3.7%.  In  total,  the  contribution  of  final  domestic   demand  to  GDP  growth  was  4.3  percentage  points.   Although   exports   expressed   in   current   koruna    prices  went  up  by  6.7%  in  2003,  imports  increased   by    7.6%    and    net    exports    made    a    negative     contribution   to   GDP   growth   (–1.6   percentage    points).  Growth prospects in 2004 and 2005  Growth prospects for 2004 and 2005 largely depend  on  the  degree  of  economic  recovery  in  the  EU,  in   particular in Germany. They will also be influenced  by    the    recently    adopted    fiscal    consolidation     package.  GDP  growth  for  2004  is  predicted  to  be   the  same  as  in  2003  (2.9%)  and  accelerate  in  2005   (3.4%).    Due    to    increases    in    indirect    taxes,     household consumption is projected to decelerate in  2004  and  to  increase  somewhat  again  in  2005,  in   line  with  the  assumed  economic  recovery.  Due  to   cuts    in    government    expenditures,    government     consumption  will  stagnate  in  2004  and  in  2005.   Growth of gross fixed capital formation is expected  to  slightly  accelerate  to  3.8%  in  2004  and  4.5%  in   2005.   The   negative   growth   contribution   of   net    exports is projected to weaken.  Inflation In    2003,    the    Czech    Republic    faced    a    new     phenomenon:     falling     prices.     Average     HICP      inflation    was    -0.1%.    Since    April    2002,    the     m onetary  authorities  have  been  undershooting  the   inflation  target.  In  2004,  inflation  is  forecast  to   increase    to    2.8%    on    average,    mainly    as    a     consequence  of  higher  indirect  taxes.  The  annual   HICP inflation is expected to remain 2.8% in 2005,  assuming  that  second-round  effects  of  indirect  tax   increases are kept under control.  Labour market   Restructuring   in   the   industrial   sector   led   to   a    continued increase in the unemployment rate during  2003  and  the  average  unemployment  rate  reached   7.8%.   In   addition   to   the   ongoing   restructuring    process,  unemployment  is  expected  to  be  affected   by  the  public  finance  reform,  according  to  which   employment    in    the    public    sector    should    be     diminished  by  2%  annually  over  the  period  2004- 2006.  Structural  impediments  in  the  Czech  labour   market will cause that economic resurgence will not  be  accompanied  by  revival  in  the  labour  market.   The  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  reach  8.2%   both in 2004 an d in 2005.  Current account  In   2003,   the   trade   balance   deficit   developed    positively. Despite high import growth on the back  of   strong   private   demand   and   investment,   the    overall deficit was smaller than expected (-2.9% of  GDP).   This   improvement   was   partly   due   to   a    favourable  development  of  the  terms  of  trade.  The   smaller  trade  balance  deficit  was  offset  by  the   diminishing  surplus  in  the  balance  of  services.  The   deficit  in  the  income  balance  further  increased  due   to higher reinvested and repatriated profits. In total,  the current account deficit reached 6.5% of GDP. In 2004 and 2005, the trade balance is projected to  slightly  improve,  mainly  has  a  result  of  improved   non-price  competitiveness  of  domestic  producers.   The   surplus   in   the   balance   of   services   as   a    percentage  of  GDP  is  also  expected  to  slightly   increase,  reaching  1.1%  of  GDP  in  2005.  Foreign   investors’  profits  are  expected  to  the  repatriated,   which  is  partially  linked  to  the  effort  of  EU-based   companies  to  improve  their balance  sheets.  This  is   expected to worsen the income balance. As a result,  the  current  account  deficit  should  remain  around   6¾% of GDP in 2004 and 2005.  Public finances  According  to  ESA95  data  communicated  by  the   Czech authorities, the general government deficit in  2003  reached  12.9%  of  GDP.  Almost  half  of  this   deficit  is  due  to  one  single  imputed  state  guarantee   (about   6.3%   of   GDP).   Without   this   imputed    guarantee the deficit would be about 6.6% of GDP,  including   other   capital   transfers   (to   the   Czech    Consolidation  Agency  and  to  the  Railways  Route   Administration).  This  deficit  would  be  better  than   the  8.0%  of  GDP  projected  in  the  Commission’s   Autumn forecast. Overall, the execution of the state  budget was better than expected in 2003. Due to the  high  2003  general  government  deficit,  gross  public   debt jumped from 28.9% of GDP in 2002 to 37.6%  of GDP in 2003.  In 2004 and in 2005, the general government deficit  is  projected  to  improve  and  to  reach  5.9%  of  GDP   and   5.1%   of   GDP,   respectively.   Diminishing    deficits  will  mainly  be  a  consequence  of  fiscal   consolidation  which  focuses  on  the  expenditure   side.  The  envisaged  expenditure  savings  should   represent     more     than     two     thirds     of     total      consolidation  the  remaining  consolidation  should   be  reached  by  increased  revenues.  However,  there   are   fiscal   risks   linked   to   the   remaining   state    guarantees  which  are  currently  estimated  at  about   7%  of  GDP.  Gross  public  debt  is  expected  to   increase  from  40.6%  of  GDP  in  2004  to  42.4%  of   GDP in 2005. 		
April/2004	Estonia	External  account  deficit  set  to  narrow,  with  growth  becoming  more   export-driven.	The situation in 2003  GDP  growth  in  2003  decreased  to  a  still  respectable   4.8%.  In  contrast  to  2002,  growth  was  based  upon  a   mo re  balanced  composition:  investment  growth  of   well above 10% and private consumption – supported  by   employment   growth,   rising   real   wages   and    increased  bank  lending  –  were  the  most  important   contributors. Export growth also picked up again, at a  m odest  rate.  However,  with  imports  still  growing  far   mo re rapidly than exports, the net foreign contribution  remained negative. This resulted in a further widening  of  the  current  account  deficit  to  13.7%  of  GDP  in   2003.  CPI  inflation  came  down  to  an  annual  average   of only 1.3%, owing to exchange rate movements and  other  temporary  factors.  Labour  market  conditions   continued  to  improve  and  the  unemployment  rate   declined to 9.3% of the labour force in the 4 th quarter,  while employment increased by 1 % for the year as a  whole.   The   general   government   surplus   in   2003    increased further to 2.6% of GDP.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005   Real  GDP  is  expected  to  grow  at  around  5-6  %  over   2004-05.     Whereas     private     consumption     and      investment will remain the most important sources of  growth  also  in  2004  and  2005,  the  overall  outlook  is   for  more  balanced  growth,  given  slowly  decreasing   domestic  demand  and  a  steady  improvement  in  the   external   environment.   Consequently,   the   current    account deficit is forecast to narrow to around 9 % of  GDP  by  2005.  Inflation  is  not  expected  to  remain  at   its  current  low  level,  but  to  accelerate  to  around  3%.   Following   the   positive   outturn   in   2002/2003,   the    general   government   budget   is   forecast   to   remain    balanced  or  in  small  surplus  over  the  forecasting   period.  Labour market, costs and prices  The strong growth performance over recent years has  translated   into   sizeable   employment   gains,   and    unemployment  came  down  to  below  10%  of  the   labour force at the end of 2003. Early figures for 2004  indicate  a  continuation  of  this  positive  trend.  Even   mo re      encouraging,      unemployment      decreased       significantly     in     North-eastern     Estonia,     where      unemployment  is  twice  as  high  as  in  the  rest  of  the   country.   Unemployment   is   forecast   to   continue    declining  in  the  medium  term,  towards  a  rate  around   9.5%, but a considerable skills mismatch will prevent  a  faster  improvement  in  labour  market  conditions.   Real wages grew by 8.3% in 2003, owing not least to  rapid  disinflation.  Nonetheless,  Estonia’s  competitive   position is expected to remain strong over the forecast  period,  since  it  is  underpinned  by  robust  productivity   growth and a flexible labour market.  Inflationary  pressure  receded  more  than  expected,  to   an annual average of just 1.3% in 2003, thanks largely  to  the  strength  of  the  euro  to  which  the  Kroon  is   pegged.  Thus,  inflation  in  Estonia  at  present  is  lower   than  in  the  euro-area.  However,  this  strong  drop  in   inflation was mainly due to temporary factors, and the  trend is expected to reverse in 2004, with a number of  tax  measures  and  administered  price  hikes  exerting   upward  pressure  on  prices.  Given  on  the  other  hand   the  weakening  impact  of th e  US  dollar  on  kroon   prices   for   imported   oil   and   consumer   electronics    goods,   the   inflation   forecast   for   2004   and   2005    remains below 3%.   Balance of payments  The  global  economic  slowdown,  and  in  particular  its   effects  on  the  telecommunication  sector  continued  to   weaken   Estonia's   trade   balance.   In   addition,   the    exceptionally  cold  winter  and  the  freezing  of  the  bay   of  Tallinn  in  2002/2003  had  a  negative  effect  on   services  exports.  The  delayed  recovery  in  the  EU   added  to  the  drag  on  demand  for  Estonian  goods   and  services,  which  grew  by  only  5.1%  in  2003.   At    the  same  time,  imports  increased  by  8.1%.  As  a       consequence,   in   2003   the current   account deficit  widened  to  an  estimated  13.7% of GDP.   As the re-  covery in the EU gathers momentum, export growth  in  Estonia  is  forecast  to  gradually  accelerate  over   2004  and  2005,  while  import  growth  is  forecast  to   temporarily  slow  down  in  2004,  partly  due  to  base   effects.   As   the   external   environment   improves    further,   and   investment   recovers,   following   a    temporary  slowdown  in  2004,  demand  for  imports   both   for   consumer   goods   and   for   intermediate    inputs  will  pick  up  again  in  2005.  The  capital   account  is  expected  to  remain  in  surplus,  which   along  with  sizeable  FDI  and  portfolio  inflows  will   help   to   better   balance   the   external   account   of    Estonia.   On   the   whole,   the   current   account   is    forecast  to  slowly  come  down  to  a  deficit  around   9% of GDP by 2005.   Public finance  The  general  government  posted  a  surprise  surplus   of 2.6% of GDP in 2003. This was achieved mainly  through  improved  tax  collection,  despite  additional   election-induced  spending  in  2003.    Certain  local   governments        (notably        Tallinn)        reported         considerable   deficits.      Tax   cuts   that   are   being    implemented   from   2004,   along   with   increased    social     benefits,     and     EU     accession-related      expenditure  are  expected  to  weaken  somewhat  the   b udgetary  position  in  2004  and  2005.  On  the  other   hand,  projected  higher  cyclical  tax  revenues,  and   strict expenditure control are expected to offset part  of  the  revenue  losses  from  the  tax  cut.  On  the   whole,  for  2004  a  reduced  surplus  of  around  0.7%   of  GDP  is  projected,  whereas  for  2005  a  balanced   budget is expected. 		
April/2004	Hungary	Strengthening of economic growth,  challenges ahead for fiscal consolidation	 The situation in 2003   In 2003 real GDP growth eased somewhat to 2.9%  owing   to   sluggish   investment   activity   and   a    negative  contribution  from  net  exports.  The  fiscal   deficit  significantly  exceeded  the  authorities'  target   for the second year running, reaching 5.9% of GDP  as  a  result  of  expenditure  slippages  (higher  than   expected   current   expenditures,   including   social    benefits,  and  interest  payments)  and  weaker  tax   revenues   (especially   from   personal   income   and    corporate  taxes).  The  external  position  deteriorated   significantly    with    the    current    account    deficit     widening    to    5.7%    of    GDP.    The    successful     disinflation process of the previous years came to a  halt in mid-2003, and inflation picked up in the last  m onths  of  the  year  reaching  an  annual  average  of   4.7%.  Prospects in 2004 and 2005  GDP  growth,  which  had  accelerated  in  the  second   half  of  2003,  is  forecast  to  remain  solid  reaching   3.2% in 2004 and 3.4% in 2005. Strong investment  growth  and  a  recovery  in  external  demand—and   hence  a  positive  contribution  of  net  exports—are   expected to underpin GDP growth in the near term.  Private  consumption,  which  had  bolstered  GDP   growth     in     recent     years,     will     slow     down      considerably    in    2004-05,    mainly    due    to    a     m oderation     in     wage     growth.     Construction      investment  is  expected  to  decline  in  the  latter  part   of  the  forecast  period  on  account  of  changes  in  the   subsidised housing loan system, although that trend  will   be   offset   by   buoyant   business   investment    activity,  especially  in  the  manufacturing  sector.  As   the  government  strives  to  control  the  public  sector   deficit, public infrastructure investment will decline  in  2004.  However,  spending  pressure  is  likely  to   emerge,  as  commitments  related  to  co-financing  of   EU-  financed  investments  increase,  particularly  in   2005. Labour market, costs and prices  A   significant   deceleration   in   wage   growth   is    forecast   following   three   years   of   hefty   wage    increases,  reaching  50%  in  some  cases.  However,   while public wages will remain broadly unchanged  in  real  terms,  private  sector  wages  are  expected  to   rise  somewhat  faster  than  the  7-8%  nominal  wage   growth that was agreed in recent wage negotiations.   The  unemployment  rate  is  forecast  to  decline  from   5.8%  of  the  labour  force  in  2003  to  5.6%  in  2005.   Moderate  employment  growth  of  around  ½%  is   likely  to  be  offset  by  a  growing  civilian  labour   force. Due  to  tax  hikes,  notably  an  increase  in  VAT  and   excises  taxes,  a  further  acceleration  of  inflation  to   6.9%   can   be   expected   in   2004.   Assuming   no    second-round effects, and no significant weakening  of  the  currency  from  the  present  level,  inflationary   pressures  are  likely  to  dissipate  and  inflation  is   expected to decline to 4.6% in 2005.   Balance of payment developments  An   improvement   in   the   trade   balance,   slowing    domestic  demand  growth,  due  to  expected  fiscal   tightening   and   decelerating   private   consumption    growth,  will  contribute  to  a  gradual  narrowing  of   the  current  account  deficit  from  5.4  %  of  GDP  in   2004 to 5.1% in 2005 1 . Public finances  In  addition  to  the  recently  revised  budget  deficit   target  for  2004  (from  3.8%  to  4.6%  of  GDP),  the   government  announced  a  series  of  measures  for  expenditure  cuts  equivalent  to  around  1%  of  GDP.   These  measures  are  aiming  at  rationalising  resource   management,  and  the  postponement  of  several  large   public investments projects. A real wage freeze in the  public   sector,   and   the   ongoing   reduction   of   the    number of public employees should also contribute to  the  reduction  of  expenditures.  Measures,  such  as  the   recent     freezing     of     subsidized     pharmaceutical      products’  prices  should  prevent  the  overspending  on   drug   subsidies,   as   seen   in   2003.   The   substantial    tightening   of   housing   subsidies   will   only   have    substantial effect in 2005. Due  to  the  tax  reform  of  last  year,  higher  revenue   from  indirect  taxes  (VAT  and  excise  taxes)  can  be   expected.  Direct  tax’  rates  (both  personal  income  tax   and  corporate  taxes)  were  lowered,  while  numerous   tax   allowances   and   credits   were   eliminated.   This    should  contribute  to  a  decline  in  the  revenue  of   corporate  taxes,  while  revenues  from  the  personal   income tax are expected to remain broadly stable.   These   measures   should   provide   a   basis   for   a    significant  narrowing  of  the  budget  deficit.  However,   the  revenue  shortfall  and  the  overspending  of  2003   still indicate some risks to achieve the target for 2004.  The risks of higher-than-envisaged housing subsidies,  tax  exemptions  and  interest  payments  remain.  The   additional   revenues   from   an   improvement   in   tax    collection efficiency might also not materialize to the  envisaged   extent,   as   such   measures   are   effective    rather   in   the   long   term.   Therefore   the   general    government deficit forecast for 2004 is 4.9% of GDP.  In  2005,  expenditure  related  to  co-financing  of  EU- related  investment  projects,  and  the  realisation  of   other  postponed  investment  project  might  limit  the   scope for a deficit reduction. Therefore a narrowing of  the deficit to 4.3% of GDP is forecast.   The gross debt ratio is estimated to have reached 59%  of GDP in 2003 and is expected to decline to 58% by  the end of 2005.  		
April/2004	Latvia	Continued robust growth, widening current account deficit 	The situation in 2003   Despite  a  weak  external  environment,  GDP  growth   continued  strongly  at  6.1%  in  2002  and  accelerated   further to 7.4% in the first three quarters of 2003 year- on-year. For 2003 as a whole, GDP growth is likely to  have  reached  7.5%.  Private  consumption  and  gross   fixed capital formation were particularly buoyant and  became driving factors for growth.  Private  consumption  is  estimated  to  have  grown  by   about 8% in 2003, supported by employment growth,  rising  real  wages  and  increased  bank  lending.  Gross   fixed capital formation remained buoyant, growing by  some 9.5%, as a result of favourable credit conditions  and   reinforced   macroeconomic   stability.   Exports    growth  was  strong  at  12.7%;  however,  imports  grew   faster  and  this  caused  a  widening  of  the  current   account    deficit.    The    current    account    balance     weakened  by  30%  and  the  deficit  increased  from   7.6%   to   9.1%   of   GDP.   During   2003,   inflation    accelerated to 2.9% from 2% in 2002. This was partly  due to  higher  regulated  prices  on  gas,  heating  and   rent.  Imports  also  become  more  expensive.  While   employment growth was sluggish, the unemployment  rate  went  down  to  10.5%.  The  general  government   deficit  in  2003  decreased  to  1.8%  of  GDP,  largely   owing to better-than-expected tax revenues.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005  Growth  prospects  for  2004  and  2005  are  strong,  with   an  expected  growth  rate  of  6.2%  each  year.  In  both   years final domestic demand is expected to be driving  growth,    primarily    led    by    increases    in    private     consumption on the back of sustained increases in real  disposable income and better access to credit. In 2004  and   2005,   private   consumption   is   expected   to    continue  to  show  healthy  growth  at  a  slightly  lower   pace  of  7.1-6.5%  as  2003  increase  of  disposable   income  is  going  to  wear  out.  Overall  investment   growth  is  lik ely  to  remain  high  at  10%  in  2004  and   2005.  Housing  investment  is  projected  to  increase   over the entire forecast period. The large depletion of  stocks   in   2002   should   come   to   an   end,   but   no    significant contribution to GDP growth from stocks is  expected for the forecast period.  External  demand  will  continue  to  be  important  for   growth.  The  recovery  of  the  EU  economy  and  a   further  assumed  depreciation  of  the  lat  against  the   euro will keep export growth strong. Import growth is  expected to remain robust, albeit at a slower pace than  exports growth, allowing for  a narrowing of the trade  balance.  Thus,  for  2005  the  contribution  from  net   exports will have recovered to –1.9 percentage points  from  –2.3  percentage  points  in  2003.  Accordingly,   real GDP is expected to grow at around 6.2% or close  to potential in both forecast years.  Labour market, costs and prices  High    growth    has    contributed    to    lowering    the     unemployment  rate,  which  decreased  from  11.3%  in   December   2002   to   10.5%   in   December   2003.    However,  upward  pressure  on  unemployment  from   enterprise   and   rural   restructuring   is   expected   to    remain.  In spite of a strong growth performance, and sizeable  employment   gains   since   2001,   the   unemployment    rate—which  remains  at  around  10.5%  of  the  labour   force—is forecast to drop only slightly in the medium  term,  to  around  10.1%.  Moderate  employment  gains   of   0.5%   per   year   over   the   forecast   period   will    contribute   to   the   decline,   although   considerable    regional  development  disparities  will  hold  back  a   faster   improvement   in   labour   market   conditions. During 2003, the inflation rate went up to 2.9% from  a sharp rise in health care costs. Imports also became  mo re  expensive.  Inflation  is  expected  to  increase  to  4.0% during the forecast period. This rise is linked to  the  expected  adjustment  of  prices  to  EU  levels  and   wage increases. In addition, there will be a new round  of administrative price hikes. From 2004, an increase  in  excise  duties  on  fuel  and  petrol  will  further  push   inflation. However, the full impact of the effect of the  increase  will  only  be  visible  in  the  second  half  of   2004  and  beginning  of  2005.  Thereafter  inflation  is   set to decelerate.  The current account  The  growth  of  exports  and  imports  in  2003  was   buoyant.  Exports  increased  by  almost  13%  in  2003   while   imports   increased   by   14.3%.   Exports   are    expected  to  expand  by  10-8 .5%  in  2004  and  2005.   Imports   should   grow   broadly   in   line   with   final    demand,  resulting  in  a  small  negative  contribution  to   GDP growth from net exports in both years.  The current account deficit increased to 9.1% of GDP  in  2003.  As  the  trade  balance  is  expected  to  worsen,   this will result in a further rise of the current account  deficit   by   about   2   percentage   points   during   the    forecast period.  Public finances  In  2003,  the  general  government  deficit  notified  by   the  Latvian  authorities  in  March  2004,  but  subject  to   further  verification  by  Eurostat  is  one  percentage   point  lower  than  expected  in  autumn  and  represents   1.8%  of  GDP.  This  was  mainly  due  to  better-than- expected   tax   revenues   and   close   monitoring   of    expenditure by the government. The total government  expenditure   did   not   reach   the   initially   allocated    amount.  For  the  forecast  period  a  broadening  of  the   VAT   base   and   the   real   estate   tax   base   should    outweigh the intended cut in the corporate income tax.  Consequently,  the  deficit  is  expected  to  approach  2%   of GDP in 2 004 and 2005. 		
April/2004	Lithuania	A broad-based economic expansion 	The situation in 2003  Lithuania’s   macroeconomic   performance   remained    particularly  strong  in  2003.  Real  output  continued   expanding  rapidly  and  is  provisionally  estimated  to   have  increased  by  8.9%  in  2003,  in  the  absence  of   significant    external    and    fiscal    imbalances    and     inflationary pressures. Domestic demand consolidated  as the major driver for growth. Private consumption is  estimated   to   have   grown   by   above   9%   in   2003,    fuelled by strong employment growth and low interest  rates. Gross fixed capital formation remained buoyant  and  is  forecast  to  have  increased  by  some  12%,   induced    by    favourable credit    conditions    and     reinforced macroeconomic stability.  Notwithstanding     a     marked     nominal     effective      appreciation     of     the     litas,     Lithuania’s     export      performance   remained   robust   in   2003,   although    export  growth  stood  below  the  impressive  levels  of   previous  years.  Import  growth  also  held  strong  and   led to a negative contribution of net trade to growth in  2003  which,  together  with  a  marked  deterioration  of   the  income  account,  drove  the  current  account  deficit   above 6% of GDP.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005   Real  GDP  growth  is  foreseen  to  remain  robust  at   about  6.5-7%  in  2004  and  2005.  Gross  fixed  capital   formation is expected to continue growing vigorously,  stimulated   by   low   interest   rates   and   increasing    investment  grants  from  the  EU,  while  the  anticipated   recovery  of  external  demand  in  Lithuania’s  major   trading partners and further productivity gains should  ensure    that    the    strong    export    performance    is     sustained.  Public  consumption  growth  is  expected  to   edge    up,    partly    associated    with    government’s     increasing  demand  for  goods  and  services  related  to   the implementation of programmes co-financed by the  EU.  Private  consumption  is  expected  to  remain  firm   due  to  sustained  employment  growth,  higher  income   prospects   and   sharp   credit   growth.   The   savings- investment  balance  is  likely  to  deteriorate  slightly  in   2004,  reflecting  robust  domestic  demand,  but  the   current   account   deficit   is   expected   to   stabilise    thereafter  at  around  6%  of  GDP,  provided  that  the   fiscal  consolidation  plans  are  attained.  Nevertheless,   the  present  credit  growth  dynamics  is  engendering   uncertainty  about  the  medium-term  developments  of   the private savings-investment balance and increasing  the risk for higher current account imbalances.  Labour market, costs and prices  Against the background of buoyant economic growth,  the  labour  market  has  significantly  improved  in  the   last two years, experiencing high employment growth  and a decrease in the unemployment rate from 16.1%  in  2001  to  12.7%  in  2003.  Employment  growth  is   expected  to  remain  relatively  high  over  the  forecast   horizon,  induced  by  strong  labour  demand  by  the   private  sector.  The  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to   decrease   to   10.7%   in   2005,   sustained   by   strong    employment  growth  and  the  effect  of  active  labour   market  policies.  Nevertheless,  significant  structural   rigidities   in   the   labour   market   related   to   low    workforce  mobility  and  mismatches  between  demand   and   supply   of   skills   constitute   a   risk   for   the    projections.  Strong  productivity  gains,  moderate  wage  inflation   and   a   large   effective   appreciation   of   the   litas    contributed  to  an  annual  average  deflation  rate  of   1.1%  in  2003  (as  measured  by  HICP).  The  deflation   trend  is  expected  to  start  reversing  in  the  second  half   of 2004 and inflation is expected to progressively pick  up  to  about  2.2%  by  2005.  Higher  prices  will  be   initially  influenced  by  tax  alignments  due  to  EU   accession  such  as  changes  excise  rates  on  fuel  and   tobacco  products  and  the  elimination  of  a  reduced   VAT  rate  on  heating  of  residential  buildings.  Other   factors  are  expected  to  add  more  pressure  on  prices,   such  as  accelerating  wage  inflation,  price  increases  among  the  regulated  sectors  and  higher  prices  of   public  transport.  Nevertheless,  maintaining  inflation   at around the foreseen levels will largely depend on a  rapid  implementation  of  structural  reforms  that  allow   Lithuania  to  sustain  the  current  productivity  growth   trend, so as to temper the impact on unit labour costs.  The  expected  inflation  scenario  assumes  that  fiscal   policy  will  shift  away  from  the  present  pro-cyclical   stance in 2005.  Public finance  The declining trend of the general government deficit  reversed  in  2003,  when  the  deficit  increased  slightly   to  1.7%  of  GDP,  from  1.4  %  in  2002.  The  increase   was largely due to higher current expenditure (mainly  in     the     form     of     agricultural     subsidies     and      compensations   for   the   loss   of   rouble   savings)    allocated  through  a  supplementary  budget  in  July   2003. The   general   government   deficit   is   expected   to    increase  further  to  2.8%  of  GDP  in  2004,  primarily   led  by  a  surge  in  public  investment,  salary  increases   for non-civil servant public workers and the transition  costs  of  the  pension  reform.  Fiscal  consolidation  is   expected  to  resume  from  2005,  when  the  deficit  is   expected   to   drop   to   2.6%   of   GDP.   The   fiscal    projections  assume  that  government  arrears  on  VAT   refunds   owned   by   the   government   to   enterprises,    which  increased  significantly  in  2001  and  2002,  are   gradually reduced.  		
April/2004	Malta	Fiscal challenges lie ahead 	The economy in 2003  The Maltese economy largely weathered the effects of  the  international  deceleration  in  2002,  but  failed  to   maintain speed in 2003. On the whole, real GDP grew  by 1. 7% in 2002  and  0.4%  in  2003.  Real  growth   contracted  by  1.9%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2003,  but   gathered momentum in the second and third quarters,  increasing by 0.7% and 1.9% respectively. This trend  was  not  entirely  consolidated  in  the  fourth  quarter.   Economic  growth  in  2003  was  driven  by  high  public   expenditure and a sudden spark in gross fixed capital  formation,   which   led   to   an   increase   in   imports.    Uncertainty    in    international    markets,    especially     faltering   demand   for   semiconductors,   negatively    influenced  export  growth  in  2003,  but  it  is  likely  to   improve  gradually  as  the  expected  strengthening  of   the technological sector in the United States and Asia  occurs.  Poor  results  in  the  tourist  sector  could  not   compensate  for  a  deterioration  of  the  current  account   balance by 1.3 percentage points.  The consumer price  index  decelerated  to  1.3%  in  2003,  stemming  from   subdued  domestic  demand  and  a  low  pass-through  of   the  Maltese  lira  depreciation  against  the  euro.  Lower   activity    in    the    tourist    sector    and    industrial     restructuring  in  manufacturing  caused  considerable   job   losses   and   negatively   influenced   employment    developments. The rate of unemployment worsened to  8.2%   in   2003,   from   7.5%   in   2002.   The   general    government deficit will jump to 9.7% of GDP in 2003  from  5.7%  in  2002.  This  one-off  rise  is  explained  by   the impact of the shipyards restructuring in 2003. As a  result,  the  debt  ratio  will  soar  around  7.8  percentage   points, to 72.0% of GDP in 2003. Prospects   The  immediate  outlook  for  the  Maltese  economy  is   for  a  gradual  recovery  in  the  growth  rate  to  1.4%  in   2004,  accelerating  to  2%  in  2005,  supported  by  the   improvement    in    external    demand    and    capital     formation.   The   accomplishment   of   the   necessary    structural  reforms,  coupled  with  the  requirement  to   reduce  the  huge  public  finance  imbalance  and  reduce   public    debt    will    set    the    pace    for    economic     developments in Malta.   GDP components   Private   consumption   is   foreseen   to   remain   below    historical  rates  as  the  situation  in  the  labour  market   and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  recent  VAT  increase  are   likely to dampen eventual improvements in household  disposable income. Despite previous high government  consumption  stemming  from  mandatory  and  quasi- mandatory  expenditure,  this  variable  is  expected  to   decelerate  in  the  forthcoming  years  as  a  response  to   maintain  fiscal  stringency  to  bring  the  public  deficit   down  to  sustainable  levels.    The  key  drivers  of  GDP   growth  will  be  external  demand,  where  exports  are   projected  to  increase  by  1.4%  in  2004  and  2.8  %  in   2005, reflecting better economic conditions in Malta’s  main   trading   partners,   and   gross   fixed   capital    formation  expected  to  grow  4.2%  and  2.6%  in  2004   and  2005,  respectively,  induced  by  stronger  demand   in   the   manufacturing   sector,   public   works   and    industrial   restructuring.      Due   to   the   very   open    character   of   the   Maltese   economy,   imports   are    estimated  to  grow  by  2.7%  in  the  period,  while  the   current account balance will slightly improve in 2005,  supported  by  a  recovery  in  tourism  revenue  and  net   transfers from the EU.  Costs and prices    As  a  result  of  a  VAT  increase  at  the  beginning  of   2004,  the  rate  of  inflation  is likely  to  increase  in  the   first  half  of  the  year,  but  the  removal  of    agriculture   and  food  levies  as  from  May  1 st will  ease  pressures   on  the  consumer  price  index  (CPI).  As  long  as  world   primary  commodity  prices  and  oil  prices  variations   remain  moderate,  significant  price  increases  are  not   expected, the CPI staying stable at slightly above 2%  in the period. Labour market  The  survey-based  unemployment  rate  attained  8.2%   in  December  2003.  This  was  due  to  poor  economic   growth,   the   implementation   of   early   retirement    schemes  linked  to  industrial restructuring,  notably  in   the  shipyards.  Furthermore,  previous  rises  in  public   wages    spilled    over    to    the    private    sector    and     subsequently    increased    unit    labour    costs.    The     unemployment rate is forecast to further deteriorate in  2004 to 8.6%, to improve gradually in 2005, provided  labour  costs  could  be  kept  under  control  to  regain   competitiveness and accelerate employment creation.  Public finances  High  mandatory  and  quasi-mandatory  expenditures,   healthcare   and   pension   systems,   early   retirement    schemes associated with shipyard restructuring, lower  than  expected  tax  collection  due  to  the  economic   slowdown    and    large    outlays    connected    to    the     construction   of   the   new   Mater   Dei   Hospital   are    overloading  public  deficit  and  public  debt  figures.  In   addition  to  this,  the  shipyards  restructuring  in  2003   brought about a one-off rise in public liabilities which  led general government deficit to 9.7% of GDP. As a  result, the debt-to GDP ratio climbed to 72% of GDP  in  2003.  The  recent  tax  rises  and  budgetary  control   streamlining,  expected  economic  recovery  and  the   im pact of EU financing on the budget as from May 1 st should bring the  down ge neral government deficit to  5.9%    and    4.5%    of    GDP    in    2004    and    2005     respectively.  As a result, a slowdown in the increase  in the public debt ratio might be expected from 2004. 		
April/2004	Poland	A broad-based  recovery  underpinned  by  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy  in   2004	Economic situation in 2003  After  the  economic  slowdown  experienced  in  2001- 02,  the  recovery  gained  strength  in  2003 . Real  GDP   growth  accelerated  to  an  impressive  4.7%  year-on- year  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2003  from  2.2%  in  the   first  quarter,  bringing  growth  for  2003  as  a  whole  to   3.7%  compared  to  1.4%  in  2002.  The  driving  force   behind  growth  last  year  was  net  exports,  boosted  by   the  sharp  real  effective  depreciation  of  the  zloty.   Private  consumption  was  held  back  by  weak  real   income growth, while fixed investment contracted for  the   third   consecutive   year,   although   less   than   in    previous years. The economic upswing was helped by  an  accommodative  fiscal  policy  and  more  favourable   m onetary  conditions,  resulting  from  the  easing  of   m onetary  policy  and  the  depreciation  of  the  currency   against the euro.   Prospects in 2004 and 2005  Real GDP growth is projected to gradually accelerate  to  4.6%  in  2004  and  4.8%  in 2005.  Net  exports  will   continue   to   support   growth   this   year   but   their    contribution  will  turn  negative  next  year.  Domestic   demand will strengthen over the forecast period, with  rising  consumer  demand  and  an  expected  rebound  in   investment.  In  addition,  against  the  background  of   easier  monetary  conditions,  the  substantial  loosening   of  fiscal  policy  this  year  will  provide  an  additional   stimulus to growth.   GDP components  Boosted by increasing corporate profits, an improving  economic  outlook  and  EU  accession,  investment  is   projected  to  pick  up  in  2004  and  grow  more  strongly   in  2005,  thus  widening  the  base  of  the  recovery.   Investment activity began to recover, but only timidly,  in  the  third  quarter  of  2003  and  should  gradually   strengthen  this  year  and  next.  Provided  that  access  to   finance  improves  for  firms,  investment  growth  could   get close to 10% in volume terms in 2005.   Private  consumption  is  projected  to  accelerate  only   m oderately  this  year,  as  wage  growth  will  remain   subdued given the still difficult situation in the labour  ma rket.  Another  restraining  factor  is  the  pick-up  in   inflation  that  will  reduce  households’  real  incomes.   Growing     consumer     confidence     and     improved      employment prospects should lead to faster consumer  spending in 2005.   Export growth is expected to remain robust, supported  by the depreciation of the zloty, productivity gains of  Polish  companies  and  the  growth  revival  in  Poland’s   main  trading  partners.  Import  growth  will  rise  in   parallel with the recovery in investment activity and is  projected to outpace export growth in 2005.  Labour market, costs and prices  The  unemployment  rate  stabilised  at  the  very  high   level  of  19.8%  of  the  labour  force  in  2003.  Despite   the acceleration of growth, employment growth is set  to  increase  only  moderately  in  a  context  of  still  large   job losses linked to the ongoing restructuring process  in  industry  and  agriculture.  Employment  growth  will   not be strong enough to make a substantial dent in the  level  of  unemployment,  which  is  projected  to  stay   high at 19.3% of the labour force in 2005.  The   recovery   will   gradually   increase   inflationary    pressures that remained subdued in 2003 in a context  of   moderate   wage   growth   and   weak   domestic    demand.  The  forecast  predicts  a  sharp  increase  in   inflation  from  the  very  low  level  of  0.7%  on  average   in  2003  to  3.0%  in  2005.  The  inflationary  push  will   come  from  the  acceleration  of  domestic  demand,  the   pass-through    of    the    currency    depreciation    and     accession-related tax and price adjustments. However,  inflation will remain within the target range set by the  National  Bank  of  Poland  (2.5%  +/-  1  percentage   point).  External accounts  Reflecting  strong  export  growth  and  weak  imports,   the  current  account  deficit  narrowed  to  2.0%  of  GDP   last  year.  A  still  good  performance  from  exports  will   limit  the  increase  in  the  current  account  deficit  in   2004,   but   following   stronger   import   growth,   the    deficit  is  projected  to  widen  more  markedly  in  2005,   reaching  2.8%  of  GDP  compared  to  2.3%  in  2004.   Higher transfers from the EU will cushion the current  account deficit and improve the balance on the capital  account. Public finances  In  2003,  the  general  government  deficit  is  estimated   to  be  slightly  lower  than  expected  in  the  autumn  and   represents     4.1%     of     GDP.     As     the     Eurostat      communiqué (issued 2 March) on the classification of  funded  pension  schemes  is  of  a  generic  nature  with   the  individual  cases  being  analysed  bilaterally,  the   forecast still considers the open pension funds as part  of  the  government  sector  (reducing  the  deficit  by   1.6% of GDP).   In    2004,    notwithstanding    the    strengthening    of     economic  growth,  the  general  government  deficit  is   projected  to  increase  su bstantially  to  6%  of  GDP   (compared to a government target of 5.7%). Eventual  savings, announced in the Hausner plan, will be offset  by  additional  expenditures  resulting  from  a  higher   indexation  of  disability  pensions  and  the  unforeseen   magnitude  of  the  zloty  depreciation  in  2003  inducing   an increased contribution to the EU budget. Revenues  would   decrease   following   the   lowering   of   the    corporate income tax rate and the change in the VAT  legislation. It is projected that the deficit will fall in 2005 to 4.5%  of  GDP.  The  improvement  of  the  deficit  would  be   mainly  cyclical  and  reflect  positive  net  inflows  from   the   EU   budget.   The   forecast   takes   into   account    savings voted in Parliament in March 2004. The gross  debt ratio is estimated to have reached 45.4% of GDP  in 2003 and would increase to over 50% by the end of  2005.		
April/2004	Slovakia	Robust growth continues 	Growth in 2003  In 2003, real GDP growth remained robust but slowed  do wn  slightly  to  4.2%  (from  4.4%  in  2002)  and  its   composition   turned   around.   Whereas,   in   the   year    before,  domestic  demand  had  been  the  main  growth   engine,   its   growth   contribution   (including   stock- building)     became     negative     in     2003.     Private      consumption  was  dampened  significantly  by  fiscal   restraint  and  adjustments  in  administered  prices  and   contracted.  So  did  gross  fixed  capital  formation.    In   spite of the lacklustre performance of Slovakia’s main  export    markets    and    reflecting    the    creation    of     significant new export capacity, exports of goods and  services rose strongly by some 23%, outpacing import  growth  of  about  14%  and  leading  to  a  net  external   contribution to GDP growth  of 6.5 percentage points.  Growth prospects   In  2004  and  2005,  growth  is  predicted  to  stay  at   approximately  the  same  level  as  in  2003.  Domestic   demand is expected to contribute positively to growth  again   (by   some   3   to   4   percentage   points),   in    consequence   of   a   gradual   acceleration   of   private    consumption  and  a  strong  pick-up  in  gross  fixed   capital formation. The latter is not least due to already  announced   greenfield   investments.   Export   growth    rates  are  anticipated  at  close  to  10%.  In  tandem  with   domestic  demand,  imports  are  expected  to  grow  at   similar  rates.  Altogether,  the  growth  contribution  by   external demand should hover around zero.  Inflation As  the  government  continues  to  adjust  administered   prices   and   indirect   taxes,   headline   inflation   will    prospectively  be  around  8%  in  2004.  In  2003,  it   reached  8½  %,  while  core  inflation  averaged  2.6  %.   Assuming  that  second-round  effects  are  kept  under   control,  significant  disinflation  should  be  possible  in   2005 -- leading to an i nflation rate of around 4½ %.  Current account  Dominated  by  a  very  strong  export  performance,  the   current  account  deficit  narrowed  from  slightly  over   8% of GDP in 2002 to less than 1% of GDP in 2003.  Foreign  trade  developments  will  continue  to  be  the   main   factor   behind   the   current   account   deficit.    Accordingly, the current account deficit should widen  again  in  2004  and  2005,  owing,  inter  alia,  to  higher   investment-related  imports.  However,  it  is  likely  to   stay significantly below 5 % of GDP.   Labour market  After a significant rise in 2002 resulting from a virtual  halt  in  administered  price  adjustments,  real  wages   declined  again  in  2003  (by  roughly  1½  %).  They  are   expected  to  continue  to  do  so  in  2004.  A  return  of   positive  real  wage  growth  rates  is  not  forecast  before   2005. Unemployment  has  been  slowly  but  steadily  falling   from  its  peak  above  19%  in  2001.  It  amounted  to  an   average  of  around  17%  in  2003.  In  spite  of  still   continuing  enterprise  restructuring,  it  is  set  for  a   further  decline  to  close  to  some  16  %  in  2005  –  the   main  reason  being  a  more  decisive  policy  stance  in   tackling   the   deep-seated   structural   labour   market    shortcomings.  Public finances  The general government deficit reached 5.7% of GDP  in the election year 2002.  After   the   elections   in   September   2002,   the   new    Slovak   authorities   initiated   a   fiscal   turn-around,    aiming at a general government deficit target of 5% of  GDP  for  2003.  With  a  deficit  of  3.6%  of  GDP,  the   government  has  substantially  over-performed  on  this   target.  At  the  beginning  of  2004,  a  far-reaching  tax   reform    was    implemented,    consisting    mainly    of     introduction  of  a  flat  income tax  and  a  unified  value   added  tax,  both  at  a  rate  of  19%.  Estimates  suggest   that  the  tax  reform  is  likely  to  be  broadly  revenue- neutral. Against this backdrop, it is projected that the  government will broadly meet its deficit target of 4%  of GDP for 2004.   For 2005, the deficit forecast is roughly 4 % of GDP,  since the government has not yet taken any measures  to  compensate  for  the  effects  of  the  introduction  of  a   mandatory  funded  pension  pillar  in  that  year.  These   effects   are   not   yet   included   in   the   government’s    announced deficit target of 3.1% of GDP.    Risks  to  this  scenario  stem  in  particular  from  the   fundamental  nature  of  the  tax  reforms,  which  make   revenue  forecasts  relatively  uncertain.  In  addition,   there  remain  uncertainties  on  the  expenditure  side,  in   particular in connection with health reform measures. 		
April/2004	Slovenia	Inflation continues to be on a declining trend	The economy in 2003   The   Slovene   economy   is   showing   a   remarkable    resilience;  the  real  GDP  growth  rate  averaged  4%  in   1995-2002. For 2003, however, growth is estimated to  have  decelerated  to  2.3%,  mainly  due  to  modest   export  expansion.  Domestic  demand,  on  the  other   hand,  remained  buoyant.  Strong  credit  growth  and   m oderate     real     wage     increases     kept     private      consumption robust. Investment expenditure was also  booming,  but  it  is  doubtful  whether  the  expansion  in   gross   capital   formation   truly   reflects   investors’    optimism    about    future    prospects    as    business     confidence has been fading and stocks have increased.  Imports   of   investment   goods   were   exceptionally    strong  in  the  second  half  of  2003.  Export  growth,  on   the other hand, decelerated further in the unfavourable  international  environment;  a  weak  EU  economy,  the   main  trade  partner  for  Slovenia,  failed  to  provide   adequate  demand  while  market  growth  of  CEFTA   (Central  European  Free  Trade  Agreement),  Russia   and     former     Yugoslavia     did     not     compensate      sufficiently,  unlike  in  2002.  The  net  external  demand   contribution   to   growth   turned   negative   while   the    current  account  surplus  quickly  eroded,  coming  close   to a balance much sooner than expected. Moreover, in  2003 a net outflow of FDI was registered for the first  time.   Outlook for 2004-2005   The   forecast   projects   a   gradual   recovery   of   the    economy. This year, an upturn is anticipated as export  growth picks up while domestic demand continues to  strengthen.    Both    consumption    and    investment     expenditure are expected to grow further, following a  boost  in  construction  activity  stimulated  by  credit   demand from the national housing saving scheme, and  increasing  exports,  linked  to  a  revived  EU  economy,   market    competition    and    enterprise    restructuring.     Imports  are  also  set  to  rise  slightly,  in  step  with   strengthened   domestic   (investment)   demand   and    exports. All in all, real GDP growth should accelerate  to 3.6% in 2005 whereas the current account will turn  (marginally) negative in 2004 and 2005.  Prices and wages   Inflation has declined markedly in the last two years –  the  average  rate  of  consumer  price  growth  dropped   from  8.6%  in  2001  to  5.7%  in  2003  –  but  is  still   relatively high. After adopting a programme on ERM- II   participation   and   adoption   of   the   euro,   the    government   enforced   co-ordination   of   economic    policies so as to meet conditions for early EMU entry.  An   anti-inflationary   policy   commitment   was   met    through  caps  on  administered  price  rises  and  indirect   taxes as well as frequent adjustments of excise duties  on oil. Also, in pursuing the objective of a generalised  de-indexation   of   the   economy,   backward-looking    indexation  mechanisms  have  been  further  weakened.   After    de-indexation    of    interest    rates,    a    wage     agreement  for  public  sector  wages  was  concluded  in   July   2003   introducing   forward-looking   indexation    with  anticipated  rather  than actual  domestic  inflation   and  also  taking  into  account  EU  inflation  and  the   euro/tolar   exchange   rate.   Furthermore,   monetary    policy    has    been    geared    towards    slowing    the     depreciation    of    the    currency,    thus    somewhat     compressing the inherent inflationary pass through. In  2003,  the  Bank  of  Slovenia  lowered  the  interest  rates   by  a  cumulative  225  basis  points.  However,  bringing   down  inflation  sustainably  might  prove  difficult  to   achieve as inflationary pressures continue to be fed by  slow liberalisation in various sectors, inflexible labour  markets,  and  remaining  indexation  mechanisms . In  addition,  steady  disinflation  might  be  under  pressure   in  an  environment  of  rallying  private  consumption.   The  public  finance  stance  is  therefore  being  further   strengthened. Labour market   In  2003,  the  labour  market  remained  weak  with  a   slight   fall   in   employment   and   an   increase   of    unemployment.    This  year  the  unemployment  rate  is   to return to past levels of slightly above 6% and then  resume  its  gradual  trend  decline  as  GDP  growth   strengthens.   External sector  A  slow  recovery  in  the  EU  weighed  on  Slovenia’s   external   sector   position.   2003   saw   a   larger   trade    deficit  and  a  smaller  surplus  in  services  as  compared   to  the  year  before,  roughly balancing  out  the  current   account.  The  deterioration  in  the  current  account  is   expected  to  continue  moderately  in  2004  and  2005,   partly attenuated by the capital transfers from the EU  funds.     Public finance   After  unexpected  setbacks  in  previous  years,  fiscal   consolidation  seemed  to  be  well  on  track.  Although   the  2003  budget  was  amended  during  the  year  -  a   common  practice  in  previous  years,  as  well  -  the   general government deficit was 1.8% of GDP, slightly  better than projected, and this against the background  of  faltering  growth.  The  general  government  budget   deficit is projected to remain broadly stable, thanks to  expenditure  limits  while  a  decline  in  revenues  due  to   the  direct  tax  reform  is  compensated  by  an  inflow  of   EU  funds.  Nevertheless,  a  potential  revision  of  the   government   accounts,   linked   to   the   sectoral   re- classification    of    some    public    institutions,    may     improve or worsen the deficit marginally (about 0.2%  of GDP). 		
April/2004	Bulgaria	Rebalancing domestic and external demand 	The economy in 2003  Real  GDP  growth  of  4.3%  was  based  on  very  strong   domestic  demand,  coming  in  particular  from  private   consumption   and   investment.      This   was   due   to    increases  in  employment  and  net  income  as  well  as,   mo st   importantly,   a   considerable   surge   in   bank    credits,  although  from  a  low  base.  Since  many  of  the   demanded  products,  mostly  durable  consumer  goods   and investment goods, are not produced domestically,  imports increased by almost 20% in real terms.  As a  consequence,  net  exports  had  a  very  strong  negative   contribution to GDP growth.  Consumer price inflation was very low in the first half  of 2003, also because of low import prices, but picked  up  again  in  the  second  half  following  increases  in   administered  prices  and  food  prices.    This  resulted  in   a  low  average  inflation  rate  and  a  higher  end-of-year   inflation rate.  Unemployment decreased significantly  as a result of net job creation in both the private sector  and  government  employment  schemes.    However,   there   is   also   a   statistical   effect   from   measures    introduced    to    enforce    the    existence    of    labour     contracts.   Preliminary  data  set  the  current  account  deficit  at  a   record  8.6%  of  GDP,  largely  because  of  a  high  trade   deficit.    However,  these  figures  might  be  subject  to   revision at a later stage since net errors and omissions  are currently at 2.5% of GDP.  Net inflows of foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  have  been  very  high  at  6.8%   of   GDP.   Since   these   are   not   only   related   to    privatisation,  but  to  a  large  part  to  the  expansion  of   existing  or  the  creation  of  new  production  capacity,   they have contributed to the import boom.  In view of  the   deterioration   of   the   current   account   and   the    revenue  over-performance  which  had  resulted  in  a   cash surplus peaking at 2.8% of GDP in October, the  general government deficit - initially targeted at 0.7%  of GDP - was revised and turned out close to balance  at the end of the year.  Prospects for 2004 and 2005  Real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  accelerate  further  to   rates of 5% in 2004 and 5½% in 2005 on the basis of  a rebalancing of domestic and external demand.  Main  assumptions  are  an  acceleration  of  activity  in  the   economies  of  Bulgaria’s  main  trading  partners,  in   particular  in  the  enlarged  EU,  as  well  as  a  continued   prudent      economic      policy      oriented      towards       macroeconomic stability and structural reforms.  The  acceleration  of  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  go   along  with  a  significant  change  in  its  composition   compared  to  2003.    Given  that  households  and  firms   face   increased   indebtedness   and   that   banks   are    becoming  gradually  more  constrained  in  additional   lending,  private  consumption  and  investment  as  well   as imports should rise at more moderate rates than in  2003  while  exports  could  increase  more  strongly.     However,  improved  business  opportunities  expected   from  EU  accession  and  rising  net  income  should   prevent   domestic   demand   from   decelerating   more    significantly.   Increases of excise taxes and of energy prices suggest  a  somewhat  higher  average  inflation  rate  in  2004.    If   wage  increases  remain  moderate,  average  consumer   price inflation is likely to see rates of 6% in 2004 and  of 4½% in 2005.  The    projected    GDP    growth    will    allow    net     employment gains of 1.5% per year in 2004 and 2005.   This will make it possible to lower the unemployment  rate  further  if  the  active  population  remains  broadly   constant  because  the  induced  increasing  participation   rate   corresponds   to   the   declining   share   of   the    working-age population. Public finances and current account  An  improved  external  environment  and  less  strong   domestic  demand  will  allow  improving  the  external   position.    Also,  the  substantial  investment  over  the   last  years  should  gradually  have  a  positive  effect  on   external  competitiveness.    Therefore,  the  trade  and   current  account  deficit  can  be  expected  to  decrease,   also  as  a  result  of  favourable  terms  of  trade.    The   significant  difference  between  the  trade  and  current   account   deficit   arises   from   high   net   exports   of    services, in particular tourism, as well as received net  current  transfers,  also  from  the  EU.    However,  the   income  balance  will  remain  negative  in  the  years  to   come  because  of  the  repatriation  of  profits  from  FDI   and,   although   declining,   payments   for   servicing    foreign  debt.    As  in  2003,  FDI  could  again  be  at   record levels in 2004 due to the finalisation of the last  major privatisation deals, while greenfield investment  continues to be high.  In  view  of  the  link  between  the  current  account  and   the   fiscal   position   through   the   investment-savings    balance,   the   forecast   assumes   that   fiscal   policy    remains   prudent.      For   2004   the   expected   deficit    amounts to 0.7% of GDP. However, the election year  2005 could see a small widening of the budget deficit  to  1%  of  GDP.    The  commitment  to  reducing  the   expenditure-to-GDP ratio, which actually increased in  2 003   because   of   the   good   revenue   performance,    implies  that  public  consumption  should  expand  by   less than GDP in 2004 and 2005 which is in line with  income  tax  reductions  implemented  at  the  beginning   of  2004.    The  assumed  continuation  of  a  primary   surplus  and  of  high  GDP  growth  will  further  reduce   the public-debt-to-GDP ratio. 		
April/2004	Romania	Sustained growth and pro-cyclical fiscal stance cause weak current account 	The economy in 2003   In  2003,  Romania’s  four-year  old  economic  recovery   weathered  the  economic  slowdown  in  the  EU  as   growth  remained  robust.    According  to  preliminary   figures,  real  GDP  growth  reached  4.9%  in  2003.     However,  growth  was  increasingly  unbalanced  and   driven  mainly  by  domestic  demand.    In  particular,   household consumption rose sharply at a pace of 7.1%  on the back of surging consumer credit and high wage  growth.      Moreover,   with   a   real   growth   of   4.6%    government    consumption    expanded    considerably     mo re  than  expected.    Gross  fixed  capital  formation   rose   rapidly   at   9.2%,   pointing   to   the   ongoing    replacement of Romania’s capital stock.   The strong domestic demand led to a sustained import  growth  of  16.3%.    With  export  growth  decelerating,   reaching   11.1%   for   the   year,   export   performance    appeared  less  vigorous  compared  to  previous  years.     This   was   also   reflected   in   industrial   production    growing at a significantly lower pace in 2003 than in  previous    years.        Consequently,    a    significant     deterioration  of  the  trade  balance  occurred,  and,  after   contributing positively to growth in 2002, net exports  turned strongly negative during 2003.  As a result, the  current   account   deficit   widened   significantly   over    2003.    After  dropping  sharply  to  3.5%  of  GDP  in   2002,  the  cumulative  current  account  deficit  rose   again to 5.9% of GDP in 2003.   Prospects for 2004 and 2005   The  outlook  for  the  Romanian  economy  points  to   sustained     economic     growth,     slowly     declining      unemployment  and  further  disinflation.    Relative  to   the     Autumn     2003     forecast,     the     significant      deterioration  in  the  trade  balance  in  2003  and  a   sharper  acceleration  in  domestic  demand  cause  an   upward revision in the current account deficit over the  forecast   period.      Based   on   a   no-policy-change    assumption,  the  continuation  of  a  pro-cyclical  fiscal   stance   leads   to   government   expenditure   for   2004    being revised upwards.   GDP growth and components  After reaching 4.9% in 2003, GDP growth is expected  to   accelerate   due   to   sustained   domestic   demand.    Household   consumption   is   expected   to   decelerate    slightly,  although  further  real  wage  growth  and  a   permanent  effect  on  disposable  income  from  lower   social    security    contribution    underpin    demand.     Consumer  credits  are  expected  to  grow  at  a  more   m oderate  pace.    Growth  of  investment  is  expected  to   remain   high   over   the   forecast   period   due   to   the    ongoing  modernisation  of  production  facilities  and  a   structural    change    towards    less    labour-intensive     production.    Export  market  growth,  stronger  inflows   of  FDI  and  improved  access  to  financing  will  also   support investments.  For 2004 and 2005, net exports  are  expected  to  remain  negative,  but  at  a  level  more   compatible with a sustainable current account deficit.  Inflation In  2003,  consumer  price  inflation  remained  on  a   downward  path  with  the  year-on-year  inflation  rate   declining to 14.1% in December, thereby allowing the  central  bank’s  target  to  be  met.    For  2004  and  2005,   inflation  is  expected  to  be  brought  further  down  in   line  with  the  disinflation  target  of  the  authorities.    In   view of the robust activity, expectations of high wage  growth,  still  insufficient  financial  discipline,  some   downward   pre ssure   on   the   currency   and   needed    upwards  adjustment  of  administered  prices  the  target   remains, however, ambitious. After accelerating in the  first  half  of  2003,  the  pace  of  real  wage  growth   m oderated in the latter part of the year, resulting in an  average  real  wage  increase  of  8.7%  in  2003.  Albeit   lower, real wage growth is projected to remain robust  in 2004 and 2005, due to further productivity gains.   Labour market  Continued   growth   in   employment   will   allow   the    reduction  in  unemployment  despite  lay-offs  incurred   by   continued   economic   restructuring.      A   broadly    stable  labour  force  supports  this  reduction.    Labour   market  trends  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  as   they    are    affected    by    revisions    and    changing     methodology. Public finances  The   fiscal   stance   in   2003   turned   pro-cyclical   as    revenue  gains  were  largely  spent  towards  the  end  of   the  year.    Strong  growth  in  tax  revenue  and  further   savings on interest payments resulted, however, in an  undershooting  of  the  deficit  target  for  2003,  reaching   2.0%  according  to  ESA  95  standards.    The  general   government deficit is expected to reach 3.0% in 2004  and 2005 on the back of continued high spending and  mo re  subdued  revenue  growth.    However,  a  more   restrictive   fiscal   policy   for   2004   than   originally    intended   might   be   the   result   of   a   planned   pre- cautionary stand-by arrangement with the IMF.   External balance  For  2004  and  2005,  the  external  balance  is  expected   to improve.  Private consumption and investment will  continue  to  drive  imports  up,  and  the  pro-cyclical   fiscal  stance  also  sustains  high  demand.    Yet,  import   growth    should,    nevertheless,    be    moderate,    as     exceptional   cereal   imports   in   2003   will   not   be    repeated.        Export    markets    are    expected    to     progressively  pick  up  and  export  growth  is  likely  to   outpace   market   growth.      As   higher   transfers   are    expected   to   mitigate   the   worsening   in   net   factor    income   and   the   services   balance   will   remain   in    surplus,  the  current  account  deficit  is  expected  to   narrow gradually.  		
November/2004	Belgium	Steady growth but some challenges ahead 	Economic recovery since the second half of 2003  After   three   years   of   weak   economic   growth,   the    economic  activity  in  Belg ium  strengthened  in  the   second  half  of  2003  and  first  half  of  2004.  Quarter- on-previous  quarter  GDP  rose  around  0.7%  in  these   four   quarters.   In   line   with   signs   of   a   moderate    slowdown in the internatio nal economy, some factors  (namely survey data) have  been pointing to somewhat  lower economic growth in B elgium in the second half  of the current year.   Both  domestic  and  external   demand  have  contributed   to  the  recovery.  In  the  first  half  of  2004  private   consumption  picked  up   substantially  to  2.4%  (year- on-year) as a result of higher employment and higher  consumer  confidence.  Gross  capital  formation  fell  by   1.5%  due  to  a  reduction  in  corporations’  investment   but   is   expected   to   impr ove   thanks   to   favourable    domestic    and    especially    external    demand,    an     increasingly    high    capacity    utilisation    rate    and     continued low interest rates.  Exports have been rising  strongly  as  a  result  of  vigorous  external  demand  and   the  much  lower  appreciation  of   the  euro.  This  should   lead  to  a  more  balanced   composition  of  growth  than   in  2003.  Employment  started  to  increase  again  but   still    at    a    low    rate,    not    enough    to    reduce     unemployment.  Accordingly,  productivity  picked  up   vigorously, as it typically does  in the first stages of an  upswing.  Inflation   picked  up  in  April  and  May  as  a   result of the high oil prices bu t should rise by no more  than 2% this year compared  to 1.5% in 2003 (HIPC).  Prospects for 2005 and 2006   It is expected that, following a small slowdown in the  second  half  of  2004,  GDP  growth  will  pick  up  again   as  from  the  first  half  of  2005.  Among  the  specific   domestic    factors    which    will    affect    economic     developments  in  Belgium,  the  on-going  direct  tax   reform  will  give  a  push  to  domestic  demand  by   providing   a   temporary   stim ulus   to   consumption,    especially  in  2005  and  2006.  Some  expansionary   effect  is  also  expected  from  the  2006  local  elections   on local public investment, both in 2005 and the first  half of 2006. Finally, wage moderation is expected to  last  because  wage  increases  in  the  three  main  partner   countries  France,  the  Netherlands  and  Germany  are   anticipated  to  remain  low.  Employment  is  forecast  to   grow   faster   in   2005   an d   2006,   leading   to   some    reduction  in  unemployment,  which  will  however  still   remain high.  Given  the  expected  wage  moderation,  the  slightly   lower   productivity   growth   in   2005   and   2006   as    compared  to  2004  will  not   put  at  risk  the  external   competitiveness.  This  is   expected  to  allow  for  an   increase in the companies’ profit rates and a moderate  recovery in investment.  Public finances: one-off measures and the direct  tax reform raise challenges for the future  As  regards  public  finances,   in  2003  the  government   accounts  benefited  from  a  net  amount  of  1.5%  of   GDP  in  one-off  measures,  which  contributed  to  a   surplus  of  0.4%  of  GDP.  In  2004  the  budget  is   affected  by  the  following  temporary  measures:  1)  the   anticipation  from  2004  to  2003  of  a  large  part  of  the   funding for the SNCB (0.4% of GDP); 2) sales in real  estate of less than 0.1% of  GDP; 3) the net impact of  several  changes  in  the  withholding  tax  on  earned   income  boosting  tax  proceeds  by  less  than  0.1%  of   GDP;  4)  the  “declaration  libératoire  unique”  would   yield a net amount of 0.1% of GDP (compared to the  0.3%  of  GDP  expected  initially  by  the  government).   Taken  together  these  four  measures  are  expected  to   have  a  positive  impact  on   the  2004  budget  of  the   order of 0.6% of GDP.   Other  than  the  temporary  effects,  the  2004  budget   results are mainly affected by the economic recovery,  which  leads  to  higher  increases  in  direct  and  indirect   taxes  than  in  the  previous   years,  by  the  continued   lowering  in  interest  payments,  and  in  the  opposite   direction, a sizable overrun in health care spending.  For 2005, a deficit of 0.3% of GDP is estimated.  This    partly  explained  by  lower  temporary  measures   stemming from the withholding taxes and sales of real  estate  (around  0.2%  of  GDP  compared  to  previous   0.6%).  Other  factors  that   impact  on  the  2005  budget   are: on the negative side, lower direct taxes (by 0.2%  of  GDP)  as  a  result  of  the  tax  reform;  some  higher   public  investment  in  the  run-up  to  the  2006  local   elections and higher interest payments than otherwise  because of the planned assumption by the state of the  debt  of  the  public  railway  company  SNCB.  From  the   positive  side  there  is  a  package  of  measures  in  the   draft  2005  budget  roughly  estimated  at  around  0.4%   of GDP . For 2006, under the no-policy change assumption, the  deficit  is  projected  to  increase  to  0.5%  of  GDP,   despite lower interest payments. This is mainly due to  the  phasing  out  of  the  one-off  measures  (0.2%  of   GDP) and the lower direct tax yields than in 2005 (by  0.4%  of  GDP)  under  the  last  transition  stage  of  the   direct tax reform. As regards the debt-to-GDP ratio, it  is expected to come belo w 100% of GDP in 2004 for  the first time since the early  eighties and will continue  to  fall  further  in  the  whole  forecast  period.  However,   the  decrease  will  be  smaller  in  2005  due  to  the   planned assumption by the state of SNCB debt in the  context  of  its  restructuring.  This  is  expected  to  raise   the  general  government  de bt  by  EUR  7.4  billion  or   2.6%  of  GDP.  The  government  intends  to  make  this   operation  next  year  provided  that:  1)  it  is  decided  at   the  EU  level  that  this  meas ure  only  affects  the  debt,   not  the  deficit;  and  2)  that  the  debt-to-GDP  ratio   remains below 100% after the operation which will be  the case if our forecast materialises.   Finally, following a decision from the European Court  of  Justice,  the  government  may  have  to  pay  back  the   amounts  collected  for  many  years  on  some  stock   exchange  operations,  but  the  procedural  details  and   the  amount  are  not  yet  known,  hence  the  impact  of   this decision is not include d in this deficit estimate. 		
November/2004	Czech Republic	Fiscal consolidation easier due to growth recovery 	The situation in the first half of 2004  During  2004,  the  Czech  Statistical  Office  revised  the   national   accounts   to   adju st   them   to   the   ESA   95    methodology.    This    statistical    revision    shows    a     somewhat  different  cyclical  pattern  and,  as  regards   demand   components,   weaker   consumption   growth    and  stronger  investment  growth  than  was  recorded   earlier.  The  changes  in  our  forecast  reflect  to  a  large   extent the new historical data.  In the first half of 2004, real GDP growth was strong  and accelerating, reaching 3.5% y-o-y in the first and  4.1%  in  the  second  quarter.  The  improvement  of   economic  activity  was  mainly   due  to  buoyant  gross   fixed  capital  formation  which   increased  in  real  terms   by 9.6% y-o-y in the first  and by 12.8% in the second  quarter.   Household   consumption   was   robust,   but    decelerating   against   the   backdrop   of   falling   real    disposable  income  and  rising  unemployment.  Public   consumption  declined,  reflecting  the  consequences  of   fiscal consolidation. The external sector was buoyant.  Growth of exports strengthen ed to 23.1% y-o-y in the  second  quarter  and  growth  of  imports  accelerated  to   24.7%.  The  increase  in  foreign  trade  volumes  in  the   second  quarter  was  mainly   due  to  the  elimination  of   the remaining trade ba rriers with the EU-15.  Growth prospects  The immediate outlook for the Czech economy is for  solid economic growth for the  rest of 2004, leading to  an annual growth rate of 3.8%. Investment is expected  to be the main driving force. Public consumption and  foreign  trade  should  have   a  negative  contribution  to   GDP growth.  GDP  growth  in  2005  will  remain  strong  at  3.8%,   accelerating  further  to  4%  in  2006,  supported  by  the   external   sector.   Final   domestic   demand   will   stay    robust.  In  particular,  invest ment  should  continue  to   expand strongly, though at a slower pace than before.  Inflation After   several   months   of   falling   prices   in   2003,    inflation picked up in 2004 against the backdrop of an  increase  in  indirect  taxes  and  high  oil  prices.  After   around  two  years,  this  took  inflation  back  into  the   target  band  of  2.2-4.2%  in   September  2004.  With   increasing  signs  of  cost  push  inflation,  the  Czech   monetary  authorities  hiked  the  base  rate  in  two  steps   by a total of 50 basis points. Forecasting a further rise  in   prices   in   the   remainder   of   the   year,   average    inflation  in  2004  is  estimate d  to  be  2.8%.  Inflation  is   projected to stay above 3% in 2005 as high oil prices  will translate into higher cost s and the negative output  gap  will  slowly  close.  Inflation  for  2006  is  estimated   at 2.9% in line with the medium term monetary policy  target.  Labour market  The  labour  market  is  slow  to  react  to  the  pick-up  in   economic  activity  due  to  st ructural  rigidities.  This   together    with    the    ongo ing    adjustments    of    the     industrial    sector    let    the    trend    of    decreasing     employment continue in 2004  and 2005. A reversal is  expected  only  in  2006.   The  unemployment  rate  is   forecast  to  rise  to  8.3%  this  year  and  to  fall  slightly   thereafter  against  the  backdrop  of  a  strong  economic   performance.  Current account  The  developments  in  2004  were  characterised  by   increasing  deficits  in  the   income  balance,  mainly  due   to  high  repatriated  profits  linked  to  previous  FDI   inflows. However, the overall structure of the current  account  appears  healthy,  with  a  slightly  declining   deficit  in  the  trade  balance  and  an  increasing  surplus   in  the  service  balance.  This   suggests  that  there  is  no   major  problem  of  international  competitiveness  for   the  Czech  economy.  The  trade  balance  deficit  is   expected to further decrease to 2.4% of GDP in 2004  from 2.7% of GDP in 2003, while the current account  deficit  is  projected  to  be  6.1%  of  GDP,  almost  the   same as in 2003. The trade balance deficit is projected  to remain at 2.4% of GDP in 2005, mainly due to high   oil  prices,  and  to  improve  on ly  slightly  to  2.2%  of   GDP  in  2006.  The  surplus  in  the  service  balance  is   expected  to  slightly  rise.  The  current  account  deficit   declines  to  5.7%  of  GDP  in  2006  as  outflows  of   repatriated profits will be increasing.  Public finances  As    a    result    of    stronger    growth,    the    general     government  deficit  in  2004  is   likely  to  be  lower  than   expected,  decreasing  to  4.8%  of  GDP.  Gross  debt  is   foreseen  to  be  unchanged  compared  with  2003,  at   37.8%  of  GDP.  The  2005  state  budget  deficit  as   approved  by  the  Parliament  is  in  line  with  the  fiscal   consolidation   path   set    in   the   May   convergence    programme.  As  economic  growth  is  expected  to  be   strong,  the  general  government  deficit  is  forecast  to   diminish  further  in  2005,  albeit  slowly,  to  4.7%  of   GDP. If the expenditure ceili ngs of individual budget  lines are applied prudently, the authorities could even  over-achieve this target.  Continued    strong    GDP    growth    should    further     facilitate  the  process  of  fiscal   consolidation  in  the   election  year  2006,  but  im portant  expenditure  cuts,   particularly  regarding  gove rnment  consumption,  still   need  to  be  agreed  upon.  Therefore,  the  expenditure   ceilings  for  2006  are  not  tak en  into  account  and  the   2006  deficit  is  projected   to  be  4.3%  of  GDP.  If   expenditure  ceilings  were  fu lly  applied,  the  deficit   target  of  3.8%  of  GDP  fores een  in  the  convergence   programme is in reach. Gross public debt is expected  to  increase  from  39.4%  of   GDP  in  2005  to  40.6%  of   GDP in 2006.  		
November/2004	Denmark	Consumption-led recovery on track  	The situation in 2004  The recovery of economic activ ity in Denmark, which  started  in  the  second  half   of  2003,  has  continued  in   2004.  Exports  expa nded  unexpectedly   strongly  in  the   first half of the year, but GDP growth remains driven  mainly  by  domestic  dema nd,  in  particular  private   consumption.  Household  spending  has  been  boosted   by  substantial  increases  in   real  disposable  incomes   due  to  direct  and  indirect  tax  cuts,  as  well  as  the   suspension in 2004  and 2005 of the contributions to a  mandatory  pension  savings  scheme.  Car  sales  have   rebounded  strongly  after   the  fall  in  2003,  and  the   robust increases in car sales in 2004 has contributed to  the  strength  of  private  cons umption.  The  target  for   real    public    consumption    growth    set    by    the     government  for  2003  was  exceeded.  However,  the   instruments  applied  by  the  government  to  limit  local   government spending are becoming more binding and  public  consumption  is  set  to  grow  only  modestly  in   2004.  Investment   growth  accelerated  in  the  second   quarter,  in  particular  in   equipment  investment,  and   industry   confidence   indicat ors   point   to   continued    expansion. After a hesitant first quarter, exports grew  robustly  in  the  second  quarter  as  foreign  demand   increased.   The present trends are expected to continue during the  rest   of   the   year.   Backed   by   strong   consumer    confidence,  consumption  is  expected  to  accelerate   further to reach its highest growth rate since 1994, as  the income tax cuts come  through into take-home pay.  As   imports   should   increase   robustly,   the   growth    contribution of net exports is  expected to be negative.   Prospects for 2005 and 2006   Continuing the upswing fr om 2004, domestic demand  should  lead  to  GDP  growth  of  2½%,  slightly  higher   than  in  2004.  Private  consumption  is  expected  to   remain  buoyant,  albeit  growing  by  marginally  less   than  in  2004.  Th e  suspension  of  the  special  pension   savings   contributions   will   again   free   funds   for    consumption.  However,  somewhat  higher  inflation   reduces  real  disposable  income  and  could  marginally   dampen  consumption  growth.  Investment  is  set  to   accelerate   as   foreign   demand   remains   high   and    capacity utilisation increases.  Denmark’s   export   markets   are   foreseen   to   grow    robustly  in  2005,  albeit  slightly  less  than  in  2004.   Danish   exports   are   set   to    grow   less   than   export    markets,  thus  losing  ma rket  shares  throughout  the   forecast period. A loss of market shares in an upswing  is  a  recurrent  phenomenon  in  Denmark  and  is  linked   to  the  composition  of  exports.  Moreover,  relatively   high wage increases in recent years have put pressure  on competitiveness. On this basis, Denmark’s exports  are  expected  to  grow  by  so me  5¼%  in  2005,  with  a   slight negative growth contribution from net exports.  In  2006,  the  stimulative  effect  of  the  March  2004   fiscal   package   is   reduced   as   the   special   pension    saving  scheme  (1%  of  gross   income)  is  reinstated.   Private   consumption   growth   is   thus   dampened.    Exports are expected to grow at a fairly robust, albeit  declining,  pace.  Import  growth  decelerates  due  to   lower   domestic   demand   and   the   contribution   to    growth from net exports turns  positive. On this basis,  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  be  2%,  around  the  rate   assessed to be sustainable in the medium term.  Labour market, costs and prices   After weakening substantially  in 2003, with markedly  falling employment and with  unemployment rising to  around  6%,  the  labour  market  started  to  improve  in   the  first  half  of  2004.  Employment  increased  but,  as   the   labour   force   also   increased,   unemployment    remained broadly unchanged. In view of the expected  strength of domestic demand in the second half of the  year,  it  is  expected  that  th e  labour  market  will  turn   and unemployment will start to fall. The improvement  in  the  labour  market  is  expe cted  to  continue  through   out  the  forecast  period,  with  unemployment  reaching   around 5% in 2006.  Wage growth has been higher in Denmark than in the  euro area in recent years. In the context of a still-weak  labour market, private sector wage growth decelerated  in  the  first  half  of  2004 .  Over  the  forecast  period,   wage  growth  is  expected  to  be  some  3¼%,  rising   moderately  as  the  labour  market  tightens  towards  the   end of the period.   Consumer  price  inflation  ha s  been  subdued  in  2004,   with  average  HICP  inflatio n  set  to  be  1.1%.  The   dampened  inflation  is  due  to  lower  import  prices,   reductions  in  excise  duties  and  decelerating  wage   growth. In 2005, inflation is  set to increase somewhat  as   the   effects   of   the   reduction   in   excise   duties    disappears   and   import   prices   are   expected   to   be    higher, in part due to higher oil prices.  Public finances   Public  finances  are  set  to  remain  sound  over  the   forecast  period.  A  surplus  of  1%  of  GDP  in  2004  is   expected  to  increase  to  around  1½%  of  GDP  in  2005   and  2006.  This  improvement   is  due  to  lower  labour- market related expenditure, normalised revenues from  the  pension  fund  yield  ta x,  but  also  substantially   increased  oil-related  revenues  from  North  Sea  oil   activities,   as   well   as   from   the   higher   oil   prices.    Following  a  decision  by  Euro stat  in  March  2004,  the   surplus  of  the  supplementary  labour  market  pension   (ATP)  has  been  reclassified   outside  the  government   sector.  This  reduces  the  general  government  balance   in  Denmark  by  around  1  percentage  point  of  GDP.   This  statistical  change  is  of  no  consequence  for  the   longer-term sustainability of public finances.  		
November/2004	Germany	Gradual shift from external to domestic demand  	The economy in 2004  In the first half of 2004, Germany’s economy grew at  a solid pace, thus putting a long stagnation to an end.  Quarterly  growth  rates  of  0.4%  in  the  first  and  0.5%   in  the  second  quarter,  albe it  low  in  comparison  with   those  of  other  EU  countries,  have  been  the  strongest   in three years.   The  upswing  is  the  result  of  booming  export  demand   in particular for investment goods for which Germany  continues   to   enjoy   a   st rong   competitive   position.    From  the  standard  pattern  for  recovery  in  Germany,   strong exports should have been transmitted relatively  quickly  into  a  turnaround  in  domestic  demand.  This   has  not  occurred.  Domestic  demand  fell  strongly  in   the  first  quarter  (-0.8%)  and  continued  to  contract  in   the second quarte r, albeit slightly.  Most   disappointing   has   been   the   performance   of    equipment  investment,  which   is  the  more  remarkable   because   practically   the   entire   additional   income    resulting  from  the  recent  upswing  has  occurred  as   higher  profits  amidst  s tagnant  labour  compensation.   Moreover  investment  volumes  are  one-fifth  below   their peak levels of 2000 an d capacity utilisation rates  have  meanwhile  returned  to  their  long-term  average.   Despite    a    rather    favoura ble    current    situation,     companies   remain   apparen tly   sceptical   about   the    duration  of  the  upswing,  havi ng  been  disappointed  in   their optimism for the previous three years. Rising oil  prices and, to a lesser extent, the strong euro are likely  to   play   a   role   in   this   context.   Also,   private    consumption  remained  stagnant.  Demand  is  suffering   from  very  low  wage  increases  (the  mirror  image  of   falling  unit  labour  costs)  and  a  still  ongoing  drop  in   employment.  Only  the  tax   reduction  at  the  beginning   of  2004  compensated  for  the  falling  gross  real  wages   and  kept  net  wages  sligh tly  positive.  However,  an   increase   in   the   savings   rate   (not   least   driven   by    uncertainty related to labour market reforms) kept real  consumption from increasing.   Prospects  Since  the  upswing  seen  in  the   first  half  of  the  year  is   exclusively based on global developments, it remains  fragile.  As  the  external  impulse  wears  off  due  to  less   buoyant   export   growth   combined   with   a   stronger    import  demand,  the  overall  growth  rate  might  soften   somewhat.  Nevertheless  there  are  first  signs  that  at   long  last  a  spill-over  into  the  domestic  economy  will   take place, leading to a gradual shift from the external  to  a  domestic  growth  c ontribution.  Early  indicators   are  a  rise  in  investment  goo ds  sales,  a  strong  import   increase, and encouraging retail sales.   While an end to the decline  of residential construction  is  not  in  sight,  an  increase  in  equipment  investment   volumes  is  likely.  This  increase  should  gradually   strengthen   as   capacity   constraints   become   more    binding.  Throughout  the  forecast  period,  companies   should benefit from very low wage increases, as high  unemployment  and  the  weak  labour  market  has  left   trade  unions  in  a  weak  position.  Private  consumption   should  also  start  to  rise.  While  wage  increases  will   stay  subdued,  the  fall  in  em ployment  should  reverse   as the recovery continues. Labour market reforms will  do  their  part  to  lower  the  employment  threshold  and   reduce de facto unemployment.   As   a   major   part   of   its   “Agenda   2010”   reform    programme, the federal gov ernment passed legislation  that improves incentives to  take up work coupled with   cuts  in  social  transfers  in  2005  (so-called  “Hartz  IV”   package).  As  a  consequence  of  tightening  the  social   benefit  eligibility  criteria,  more  than  200  000  persons   are  estimated  to  be  forced  to  register  as  unemployed   in order to continue receiving social benefits. Thus the  surge in unemployment in the table below occurs as a  statistical  effect  due  to  the  systems  change.  At  the   same time, it can be expected that the introduction of  the   Hartz-measures   in   Ja nuary   2005   will   quickly    dispel  much  of  the  uncertainty  even  of  large  parts  of   the population that are not  immediately concerned by  the reforms. The savings rate is therefore projected to  fall throughout the forecast period.   Government  consumption  in  the  next  two  years  will   provide no growth contribution due to the tight fiscal  situation,  although  the   composition  of  growth  will   become much more tax-fri endly than in 2004.   Even though the assumption underlying the forecast is  a complete replacement of the net foreign contribution  with  domestic  investment  and  consumption  demand,   the  growth  profile  should  sh ow  neither  a  significant   acceleration nor deceleration. The seeming slowdown  in projected GDP growth from  close to 2% in 2004 to  values  slightly  above  1½ %  in  2005  and  2006  is   almost entirely the result of changing calendar factors,  which  add  some  ½  pp  to  growth  in  the  current  leap   year and subtract ¼ pp in each of the following years.   The main downside risk to the forecast can be seen in  higher oil prices and a parallel strong slowdown in the  world  economy.  On  the  upside,  the  Hartz-reforms   leave  Germany  with  a  more  flexible  labour  market   and   improve   the   economi c   growth   potential.   The    dynamics  of  this  are,  however,  hard  to  gauge  and   depend   both   on   successful   implementation   and    whether it is followed by further reforms.   As  a  consequence  of  low  wage  growth,  inflation  will   remain   moderate.   After   a   relatively   strong   HICP    increase  in  the  current  year  (as  a  result  of  high  oil   prices   and   the   statistical   effect   of   medical   co- payments),  inflation  should  return  to  very  low  levels   of 1¼ % annually.  Public finances   The  general  government  deficit  is  projected  to  reach   3.9%  of  GDP  in  2004,  thus  continuing  its  steady  rise   since  2001.  This  is   mainly  due  to  a   projected  fall  in   government revenues by 0.5% in 2004. One important  reason  is  the  large  reductio n  in  income  taxes  rates   equalling  0.7%  of  GDP  that  was  implemented  at  the   beginning of 2004 as part of the tax relief laws passed  in  2000.  This  was  only  partly  counterfinanced  by  a   broadening  of  the  tax  base .  In  addition,  lacklustre   domestic  demand  has  kept  consumption  tax  revenues   low.  Tax  shortfalls  are  further  accelerated  by  low   mineral  oil  taxes  in  the  wake   of  rising  oil  prices  and   the  fact  that  the  increase  in  the  tobacco  tax  rate  in   March  2004  did  not  translate  into  higher  revenues  so   far.  A  tax  amnesty,  aimed  at  repatriating  savings   currently deposited undeclared abroad, is projected to  contribute less than planned to government revenues.   General  government  expenditures  are  projected  to   remain   almost   unchanged    in   nominal   terms.   The    health  sector  reforms  introdu ced  in  the  beginning  of   2004  substantially  reduced  government  spending  on   health   care,   which   enables   the   statutory   health    insurance   providers   to   run   a   surplus   this   year,    reducing the debt they have accumulated over the last  years. Also, pension transfer s have been cut. However  the ongoing worsening of the labour market has led to  rising      expenditures      on      transfers      such      as       unemployment and social assistance.   In cyclically-adjusted terms, the deficit is expected to  widen from 3.0% of GDP in 2003 to 3.4% of GDP in  2004.  However,  with  the  output  gap  closing,  this  is   mainly the result of the ta x-unfriendly composition of  growth, rather than discretionary loosening.   Deficit above 3% of GDP in 2005  In  2005,  the  German  general  government  deficit  is   projected  to  fall  to  3.4%  of  GDP,  on  unchanged   policies,  which  would  imply  a  fourth  consecutive   breach of the 3% of GDP ceiling. General government  revenue is expected to grow by almost 2% despite the  implementation  of  the  last  stage  of  the  tax  relief  law   from  the  year  2000,  not  least  because  rising  profits   will  lead  to  higher  corpor ate  taxes.  In  addition,  the   introduction  of  a  road  toll   is  expected  to  add  to   revenues.   Expenditures   are   expected   to    rise   only   slightly,    though  by  more  than  in   2004.  The  dampening  effect   of   the   health   sector   reforms   will   abate.   Whether    statutory health insurers w ill continue to run surpluses  to   reduce   their   accumulated   debt,   may   not   least    depend  on  political  pressure  on  them  to  lower  the   47 47 Chapter 3  Member States, Germany - 48 -  contribution   rates.   The   Hartz   IV   reforms   should    reduce  social  spending,  t hough  initially  this  may  be   mitigated  by  administrative   frictions  in  the  transition   to the new system.   In cyclically-adjusted terms, the deficit is expected to  narrow  by  0.5  percentage  points  to  2.9%  of  GDP  in   2005,  not  least  as  the  composition  of  GDP  growth  is   projected     to     become     more     tax-friendly.     The      mainbudgetary  risks  for  2005   would  be  a  continuing   stagnation of private consum ption translating into tax  shortfalls  and  the  labour   market  developing  more   unfavourably than projected.  The  general  government  deficit  is  projected  to  fall   below  3%  of  GDP  in  2006   by  a  narrow  margin.   Growing  private  consumption  is  expected  to  bolster   tax  revenues,  while  no  further  tax  cuts  are  planned.   Again,   the   tax   revenue   effects   from   the   growth    composition   shifting   to   domestic   demand   will   be    mechanically    reflected    in    a    reduction    of    the     cyclically-adjusted   deficit.    Expenditure   growth   is    expected   to   accelerate,   though   yet   moderately.   A    recovering  labour  market  in  combination  with  the   legislated labour market reforms are expected to show  effect on social transfers.   Nonetheless,  the  expenditure  restraint  of  2004  and   2005   comprised   in   part   one-time   measures,   like    pension  and  public  sector  wage  freezes,  and  without   further structural measures, health care spending may  return to pre-2004 high growth rates. Thus, in order to  bring the public finances on  a sustainable path, further  long-term  consolidation  meas ures  on  the  expenditure   side  are  needed.  Government  debt  is  expected  to   continue rising until 2006, s taying considerably above  the reference value of 60% of GDP. 		
November/2004	Estonia	Buoyant exports and lively domestic demand set to continue 	The situation in 2004  GDP growth accelerated during the first six months of  2004  to  6.3%  year-on-year   from  an  annual  growth   rate of 5.1% in 2003. Main dri vers of growth in 2004  are  net  exports,  supported  by  good  results  in  foreign   tourism,  and  buoyant  domestic  demand.  Investment   grew by 6.1 % in the first half of this year, regaining  strength  since  last  year.  C onstruction  did  particularly   well  on  the  back  of  a  strong  pre-accession  housing   boom  that  also  boosted   credit  demand  by  over  30%.   During  the  second  quarter ,  CPI  inflation  picked  up   strongly, to rates around 4%, reflecting hikes in excise  taxes   and   some   administrative   prices   that   were    induced  by  EU  accession.  Since  July,  these  one-off   effects    have    started    to    abate    and    inflation    is     moderating again. Labour market conditions continue  to improve. The unemployment rate declined to 9.1%  of   the   labour   force   in   the   2nd   quarter,   while    employment is constantly in creasing from a low level.  The planned general government surplus for 2004 was  revised downwards to 0.3% of GDP, from 0.7%, with  a  supplementary  budget  to  the  tune  of  0.4%  of  GDP.   On  the  whole,  the  situation  in  2004  is  marked  by   various  EU  accession  effects,  most  of  which  can  be   expected to be temporary.   Prospects for 2004 and 2005   EU   accession   not   only   affected   prices,   but   also    triggered    a    housing    boom    supporting    strong     construction  activity,  combin ed  with  buoyant  credit   expansion.   Household   demand   was   reinforced   by    inventory build-up in the months prior to 1 May 2004.  It   also   changes   the   composition   of   government    revenues,  and  inflates  both   revenue  and  expenditure   ratios.  Therefore,  2004  ma y  display  some  irregular   economic     developments     in     response     to     this      ‘exogenous  shock’.  Given  the  strong  base  from  the   first  two  quarters,  real  GDP  is  expected  to  grow  by   5.9%  this  year,  and  to  further  accelerate  over  the   forecast  horizon.  With  exports  picking  up  strongly,   and    government    consumption    declining,    growth     should  become  somewhat  more  balanced.  The  fiscal   stimulus from the reduction  of the government surplus  by  roughly  2.5%  of  GDP  this   year, and the inflow of  EU  transfers  will  fuel  gr owth  well  into  2005-2006.   Investment is expected to remain strong, not least due  to    public    infrastructure    spending    and    smooth     absorption   of   EU   transf ers   since   May.   Inflation    should  peak  at  3.5%  in  2005  and  abate  gradually   thereafter.   Oil   prices   remain   a   risk   factor   to   the    inflation  forecast,  with  a  first  petrol  price  increase  in   October.   Labour market, costs and prices  The  strong  growth  performance  over  recent  years   continues to translate both  into sustained employment  gains   and   lower   unemployment.   Also,   regional    disparities in the labour market are starting to decline.  These  trends  are  forecast  to  prevail  over  the  forecast   period.  The  persisting  skills   mismatch  will  prevent  a   faster  improvement  in  la bour  market  conditions,  and   could   at   some   point   even   lead   to   shortages   of    qualified  labour,  which  are  likely  to  be  reinforced  by   strong  demand  for  Estonian   workers  in  neighbouring   EU  countries.  As  a  result  of  higher  inflation  coupled   with  considerable  wage  moderation,  real  wages  are   increasing  more  slowly  in   2004  than  in   2003.  Over   the forecast period, declining real unit labour costs are  expected  to  further  impr ove  Estonia’s  competitive   position.   Balance of payments  External   trade   data   are   les s   reliable   at   present,    following the methodologi cal changes in computation  that  were  required  upon  EU  accession.  Even  if  the   levels  and  growth  rates  are  uncertain,  Estonia’s  trade   balance  has  somewhat  improved  through  a  strong   pick-up in exports that wa s caused by the rebound of  external  demand,  both  from  the  EU  and  beyond.  The   positive   contribution   fro m   the   services   balance increased,  thanks  to  a  g ood  foreign  tourism  season.   On   the   current   account,   these   overall   positive    developments are largely offset by a negative income  balance  which  reflects  primarily  repatriated  profits   (often in the form of reinvested earnings which come  back  on  the  capital  account  as  FDI),  but  also  large   inter-banking   operations   between   the   dominating    Scandinavian  banks  and  their  Estonian  branches.  On   the  capital  account,  increasing  outward  foreign  direct   investment  of  Estonian  companies,  primarily  into  the   Baltic   neighbour   states   is   offsetting   part   of   the    incoming    FDI.    Overall,     the    capital    account    is     expected   to   remain   in   surplus,   which   along   with    sizeable  FDI  and  portfolio  inflows  will  help  to  better   balance the external account of Estonia in the medium  term.  On  the  whole,  the  decline  of  the  high  current   account deficit risks being delayed beyond 2004. The  deficit  is  forecast  to  remain  around  13%  of  GDP  in   2004, before starting to come  down to a level around  10% of GDP at the end of the forecast period.  Public finance  A  strong  fiscal  stimulus  is  supporting  growth,  since   the  revised  surplus  of  3.1%   of  GDP  in  2003  is  being   reduced to an expected 0.5% this year. In the medium  term,  the  Estonian  government  is  targeting  balanced   budgets.  However,  prudent   budget  assump tions  and   continuing  improvements   in  tax  collectio n  are  likely   to  lead  to  modest  surpluses  also  in  2005  and  2006.   Certain   local   governments    (notably   the   city   of    Tallinn) continue to report considerable deficits, albeit  on  a  declining  trend,  since  some  are  reaching  their   legal borrowing limits. A  supplementary 2004 budget  to   the   tune   of   0.4%   of   GDP   was   presented   to    Parliament  in  September.  It  will  compensate  local   governments  for  shortfalls  in   income  tax  shares  that   occurred as a consequence of the ongoing tax reform.  The  2005  budget  was  adopted  by  the  government  in   September,  and  foresees  the  implementation  of  a  cut   in  the  flat  tax  rate  for  both  corporate  and  personal   income tax by 2 percentage points.  		
November/2004	Greece	Challenges in the post-Olympic Games’ period 	Economic activity in 2004   Although  decelerating  with   respect  to  the  previous   years,  economic  activity  remained  buoyant  in  2004,   with  real  GDP  growth  estimated  at  3.8%,  well  above   the  the  euro  area  average.  Growth  was  driven  by   domestic     demand,     in     particular     government      consumption,    linked    to    the    Olympic    Games.     However,      investment      growth      slowed      down       significantly  compared  with  2003,  since  the  bulk  of   construction   investment    related   to   the   Olympic    Games  was  fully  realised  by  June  2004.  Yet,  for  the   year  as  a  whole,  gross  fixed  capital  formation  was  a   significant   contributor    to   GDP   growth.   Despite    supportive  monetary  conditions,  private  consumption   is  expected  to  decelerate  somewhat  relative  to  the   previous  year,  as  real  disposable  income  growth  in   2004   seems   to   slow   dow n.   Owing   to   the   sharp    acceleration  of  exports  of  services  and  to  an  increase   in the net current transfer s from the rest of the world,  the current account deficit s eems to have narrowed in  2004. Exports of goods deteriorated due to substantial  competitiveness  losses.  In  parallel,  imports  of  goods,   in   particular   equipment,   increased,   pushed   up   by    dynamic investment.   Employment  growth  was  strong,  following  booming   economic     activity,     and     helped     reducing     the      unemployment  rate.  Yet,  the  unemployement  rate  in   Greece   remained   among   the   highest   in   the   EU.    Compensation    per    head     increased    due    to    the     implementation  of  the  2004  wage  agreement  in  the   private  sector,  while  consumer  prices  are  expected  to   decline to 2.9% in 2004  from 3.5% in 2003.  Prospects for 2005 and 2006   As the Olympic Games related investments cease and  the  government  implements   significant,  but  likely   insufficient  budgetary  adjustments,  domestic  demand   is  expected  to  decelerate.  Nevertheless  the  domestic   sector  will  continue  being  the  main  driving  force  of   GDP  growth.  Real  GDP  growth  should  resume  to  a   slightly  above  potential  rate,  reaching  3.3%  in  both   2005  and  2006.  On  the  back  of  rising  indebtedness   and  expectations  for  a  deceleration  of  real  disposable   income,   private   consumption   is   expected   to   slow    down.  Public  consumption  is  expected  to  sharply   decelerate  as  the  government  undertakes  measures  to   reduce   the   excessive   deficit.   Since   the   Olympic    Games  related  investments  will  not  be  recurring  in   2005, growth of fixed capital formation is expected to  slow   down,   albeit   still   outpacing   the   euro   area    average.   The  current  account  deficit  is  projected  to  decline  in   2005 and in 2006, since exports of goods and services  are expected to increase within the context of a global  economic  recovery.  On  the  other  hand,  the  growth   rate of imports of goods should slow down due to the  projected  deceleration  of  investment.  As  a  result,  the   negative  contribution  of  the  external  sector  should   narrow in 2005 and be  positive in 2006.   Costs and prices    The  consumer  price  index  (national  definition)  is   expected to increase by 2.8% in 2005 and by 2.6% in  2006. According to the new two-year wage agreement  concluded on 13 May 2004, employees will receive a  nominal  pay  rise  of  6.0%   in  2004  and  5.5%  in  2005.   This is well above average  inflation. Unit labour costs  for  the  whole  economy  are  expected  to  decelerate   during  the  forecast  period.  Still  the  growth  of  unit   labour  costs  in  Greece  will  remain  well  above  the   euro    area    average.    This    may    adversely    affect     competitiveness, since real wage growth will outpace  productivity  growth,  which   is  projected  at  2.3%  and   2.2% in 2005 and 2006 respectively.   Public finances   The EDP notification of September 2004 showed that,  in   spite   of   strong   growth,   Greece   has   been   in    excessive  deficit  since  2000.  After  reaching  4.6%  of   GDP   in   2003,   the   deficit   is   expected   to   further       increase  in  2004  to  5.5%  of  GDP.  Although  partly   attributable    to    some    non-recurrent    factors    (e.g.     organisation  of  the  Olympi c  Games,  electoral  cycle),   rising  deficits  clearly  point   to  a  lack  of  control  over   primary    spending    (wages,    pensions    and    social     transfers,    operational    spending),    while    budget     revenues, including revenues from EU grants, seem to  fall short of projections. The debt ratio is expected to  significantly  increase  in  2004   (112.1%  of  GDP),  up   from  109.9%  in  2003.  Based  on  a  rather  optimistic   macroeconomic  scenario,  the  2005  draft  State  budget   targets    a    significant    reduction    in    the    general     government deficit, from 5.3% of GDP in 2004 (EDP  notification)  to  2.8%,  thus  falling  just  below  the  3%   threshold     as     required      in     the     EDP     Council      recommendation under Art.10 4(7). This improvement  in  the  general  government  deficit  by  2.5  pp  (2.2  pp   increase  in  primary  surplus  and  0.3  pp  decline  in   interest  payments)  does  not  imply  a  tightening  in   fiscal  policy  stance  as  it  stems  mostly  from  the  one- off  expenditures  related  to  the  Olympic  Games  in   2004   and   from   expected   buoyant   revenues,   in    particular  from  social  contributions.  According  to  the   Commission Autumn 2004 forecasts, which are based  on  a  more  realistic  scenario,  the  general  government   deficit is projected to fall by 1.9 pp and attain at 3.6%  of GDP in 2005. This should be the result of a 1.6 pp  increase in the primary surplus and a 0.3 pp decline in  interest  payments.  Theref ore  the  budgetary  plans  of   the   government   appear   insufficient   to   bring   the    nominal  deficit  below  the  3%  threshold.  Under  the   assumption of unchanged policies a deficit of 3.0% of  GDP is projected for 2006. The primary balance is set  to   improve   by   0.5   pp   in    that   year.   The   general    government  debt  ratio  is   expected  to  still  decline  at  a   very slow pace during the forecasting period. In 2005,  the  debt  ratio  is  projected  to  reach  111,9%  of  GDP   and 110.2% in 2006. 		
November/2004	Spain	Losing competitiveness	Economic developments in 2004  GDP growth in 2003 was recently revised upwards by  0.1   of   a   percentage   point   to   2.5%,   with   private    consumption and investment in dwellings as the main  driving forces. In contrast, the external sector posted a  negative    contribution    to    GDP    growth    of    0.8     percentage points. The first two quarters of 2004 offer  a   similar   picture,   with   growth   based   on   strong    domestic demand, while the external sector recorded a  growing negative contribution.   Private consumption, sustained by sound employment  growth,  is  currently  keeping  its  dynamism  and  even   gaining some momentum compared with the previous  year.  Construction  continues   to  grow  slightly  above   4%  and  is  expected  to  remain  robust  during  the   second  half  of  2004.  Invest ment  in  equipment  was   rather   sluggish   in   the   first   two   quarters   and   is    expected to show a very limited recovery in the rest of  the  current  year  due  to   the  still  uncertain  economic   outlook.  Overall,  domestic  demand  should  accelerate   in     2004,     sustained     by     private     consumption      expenditure and investment in dwellings.  The  strength  of  domestic  demand  continues  to  boost   imports   of   goods   and   serv ices   in   2004   whereas    exports  growth  is  less  dynamic  due  to  poor  external   market     conditions     and     competitiveness     losses      stemming   mainly   from   cumulated   inflation   and    productivity  differentials.  As  a  result,  the  external   sector  is  expected  to  register  a  negative  contribution   slightly  above  1%.  All  in  all,  for  2004  as  a  whole,   GDP   is   foreseen   to   grow   by   2.6%,   only   0.1    percentage  point  more  than  in  2003.  These  figures   present   an   unbalanced   growth   scenario   based   on       growing  household  indebtedness  linked  to  the  boom   in   residential   construction.    In   addition,   the   high    negative   contribution   of    the   external   sector   may    reveal      some      weaknesses      in      the      external       competitiveness,   which   c ould   challenge   economic    performance in the medium term.   Prospects for 2005 and 2006  Due   to   still   sound   empl oyment   growth   and   easy    monetary conditions, growth in 2005 will continue to  be  based  on  buoyant  domestic  demand,  along  with  a   broadly  stable  negative  external  contribution  to  GDP   growth.    The    expected    moderation    of    private     consumption   stems   from   the   sizeable   households’    indebtedness while the still  high inflationary pressures  and  the  worsening  in  the  terms  of  trade  may  also   negatively   affect   consumers’   purchasing   capacity.    Construction  is  also  foreseen   to  register  a  moderate   deceleration that should be offset by a mild pick-up in  investment  in  equipment.  The  latter,  although  still   behaving timidly, would be  the main factor explaining  the   anticipated   acceleration   in   gross   fixed   capital    formation.  Conversely,  still  uncertain  prospects  for   the  international  economic  setting  would  be  behind   the modest acceleration of exports, whereas the strong  final demand would keep feeding imports growth well  above   exports.   Ac cordingly,   GDP   growth   would    remain  barely  changed  with  respect  to  the  previous   year at 2.6%.   The year 2006 is projected to record a broadly similar  performance,  with  GDP  accelerating  marginally  to   2.7%,  still  below  potential.  Growth  composition  is   expected to remain unbalanced, based on the strength  of   domestic   demand,   while   the   negative   external    contribution   would   remain   close   to   a   bleak   1%.    Although    still    recordin g    healthy    growth    rates,     households’  indebtedness  is  expected  to  take  its  toll   by  constraining  private  consumption  developments.   Construction  is  expected  to  further  decelerate,  partly   due  to  tighter  monetary  conditions,  while  investment   should   accelerate   only   slightly   in   line   with   the    moderate recovery of exports.  Labour market   Employment growth should re sume at close to 2% in  terms  of  full-time  equivalent  jobs  during  the  whole   forecast   period.   Job   creation   is   expected   to   be    concentrated  in  sectors  wh ere  productivity  is  low,   mainly  construction  and  some  market  services.  In   contrast,  job  losses,  although  at  a  lower  pace,  will   continue   in   manufacturing   activities   in   2004   and    2005. This trend is expected to revert at the end of the  forecast  period.  The  employment  rate  is  foreseen  to   follow an upward trend and increase by at around two  percentage  points  over  the  forecast  period,  ending  at   slightly above 63% (EUROSTAT definition).  Notwithstanding  the  envisage d  increase  in  the  active   population  by  2%  throughout  the  forecast  horizon,   mainly due to still-high immigration flows and female  participation,    the    expected    employment    growth     should help reduce the unemployment rate below 11%  in  2005  (EUROSTAT  definition).  Nevertheless,  the   decreasing path of unemployment reduction should be  very  flat  and  the  unemployment  rate  should  remain   well above 10% at the end of the forecast period.   Costs and prices  Despite  the  moderation  in  unprocessed  food  prices,   the  oil  price  hikes  in  the  s econd  and  third  quarters  of   the year pushed up head line inflation significantly. As  a  result,  HICP  is  forecast  to  grow  slightly  above  3%   on  average  in  2004,  barely  changed  compared  to  the   previous year. Inflation  is  expected  to  moderate  from  the  second   quarter  of  2005.  On  average,  HICP  inflation  should   ease  marginally  to  2.9%  in   2005  and  fall  further  to   2.5%  in  2006.  Despite  this  deceleration  in  terms  of   HICP,  inflationary  pressures  in  the  Spanish  economy   will  persist  during  the  projection  period.  Leaving   aside  energy  components,  prices  of  imported  goods   show  a  more  moderate  behaviour  than  domestically   produced goods. Thus, the GDP deflator should grow  well above the HICP. While this gap is expected to be  around 0.7 percentage points in 2004, it is foreseen to  widen to almost 1% in 2006.   Compensation  per  head  should  decelerate  in  2004.   However,  the  rise  in  inflation  in  2004  will  accelerate   wage increases through inde xation provisions in 2005.  In  the  absence  of  inflatio nary  surprises  in  2005,  the   effect  of  indexation  clauses  in  2006  should  be  more   moderate.   Accordingly,   in   2006,   compensation   of    employees per head is projected to decelerate to some  3.6%.  This  wage  behaviour,  coupled  with  sluggish   apparent  labour  productivity,  should  imply  a  rise  in   unit labour costs in 2005 and lead to a moderation by  the end of the projection period.   External sector  The   growing   trade   deficit   in   goods   reflects   both    strong   domestic   demand   growth   relative   to   weak    external  markets  and  the  ongo ing  worsening  in  cost   competitiveness.  This  def icit  will  be  only  partially   offset by the services balan ce.  The  traditio nal surplus  recorded  by  services  is  expected  to  narrow  gradually   during   the   forecasting   period,   mainly   due   to   the    subdued   behaviour   of   tourism.   Accordingly,   the    current  account  deficit  is  fo reseen  to  wi den  further   over  the  forecast  horizon,  raising  concerns  about  its   sustainability.   The  increasing  presence  of  Spanish  firms  overseas,   coupled    with    falling    flows    of    foreign    direct     investment,   will   tend   to   moderate   the   traditional    deficit  of  the  balance  of  pr imary  incomes  during  the   forecast period. In contrast, the high immigrant flows  will  keep  the  deficit  of  net   current  transfers  broadly   stable.    As  a  result,  the  current  account  balance  and   the net lending position of the economy are envisaged  to   deteriorate   steadily   to   nearly   5%   and   4%,    respectively. These numbers  reveal a competitiveness  loss  that  stems  from  the  cu mulated  positiv e  inflation   differentials  and  low  prod uctivity  growth  and  scant   product differentiation.  Public finances  In 2003, despite personal income tax cuts, the general  government   balance   achieved   a   better   result   than    expected,  supported  by  robust  indirect  tax  collection   and social security contributions, registering a surplus  of 0.4% of GDP.  Revenues  in  2004  remain  buoyant  because  of  the   relatively    strong    domestic    demand    and    robust     employment     growth.     However,     some     one-off      measures  adopted  by  the   new  government   in  office   since  March  2004  that  do   not  involve  revisions  for   past years will affect the general government balance  in  the  current  year.  Among  them,  the  assumption  of   the Railway Network Company’s debt by the Central  government will increase its deficit by 0.7% of GDP.  Other  minor  adjustments  correspond  to  the  inclusion   of    RTVE    (public    television)    in    the    general     government  sector  in  2004,  which  raises  the  State   deficit  by  0.08%  of  GDP  and  a  credit  granted  to   Argentina  amounting  to  0.03%  of  GDP.  Overall,  the   initially   planned   balanced   budget   for   the   general    government sector in 2004 is  now expected to turn to  a deficit of 0.5% of GDP.  In the budget for 2005, the  government targets a small  surplus  of  0.2%  of  GDP  for   the  consolidated  balance   of  the  State  and  the  social  security  system.  When   including   the   territorial    governments,   the   general    government surplus is reduced to 0.1% of GDP.   The   new   draft   budget   plans   to   increase   social    protection   and   expenditure    in   infrastructures   and    R&D  and  innovation  activities,  which  are  considered   to  be  the  main  spending  areas.  On  the  revenues  side,   indirect  and  direct  taxes,  as  well  as  social  security   contributions    are    expected    to    remain    buoyant,     supported  by  strong  job  cr eation  and  firms’  higher   profits in 2005. The official target, however, might be  based on optimistic growth assumptions. Therefore, a  more realistic macroeconomic scenario would yield a  marginal deficit of 0.1% of GDP.   Under a no-policy change assumption, 2006 could be  close to a balanced budget for the general government  as a whole. This projection is subject to a high degree  of    uncertainty    and    pressures    for    higher    social     expenditure  might  change  th is  scenario.  Accordingly,   after  deteriorating  in  200 4,  the  primary  surplus  is   projected  to  remain  broadly  stable  at  around  2%  in   2005  and  2006.  The  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  expected  to   continue  to  decline  during  the  forecast  period,  falling   below  50%  of  GDP  already  in  2004  and  to  around   43% of GDP by end-2006. 		
November/2004	France	Sound growth and limited fiscal efforts 	The situation in 2004   The  economic  recovery  continued  in  the  first  half  of   2004,   when   real   GDP   growth   exceeded   3%   in    annualised  terms,  after  2.5%  in  the  second  half  of   2003.  This  was  the  stronge st  performance  in  the  last   four years. Contrary to wh at was observed in the euro  area  as  a  whole,  the  French  recovery  was  supported   by     domestic     demand,     especially     by     private      consumption.  In  a  context  of  protracted  weakness  of   household’s  gross  disposable  income,  the  dynamism   of consumption was driven by a large and unexpected  decline in the saving ratio: after the implementation of  reforms   on   pensions   and   healthcare,   the   latest    consumer’s  surveys  suggest  that  households  are  less   concerned  by  their  current  financial  situation.  The   rebound   on   equity   markets   and   the   increase   in    housing prices may also have encouraged households  to  free  up  some  savings.   Nevertheless,  the  decline  in   the saving ratio occurred despite the ongoing increase  in  unemployment:  the  clear  rebound  of  real  GDP   growth  observed  for  one  year  has  not  yet  triggered   any    improvement    in    th e    labour    market,    with     employment  growth  remaining  very  weak  in  the  first   half  of  2004  (see  graph  below).  In  a  context  of   improving demand prospects, and of increasing profit  margins, business investment accelerated significantly  in the first half of this y ear, contributing further to the  economic   rebound.   The   latter    was   limited   by   a    significant   drag   from   the   external   sector,   which    reflected  the  relative  weakness  of  exports,  especially   compared  to  developments  in  some  other  euro  area   countries, and buoyant imports.   Recent    macroeconomic    indicators    suggest    that     economic  activity  is  gradually  decelerating.  Notably,   personal  business  expectations  in  the  manufacturing   industry  have  hardly  improv ed  in  the  recent  months.   In such a context, and factoring in a rise in uncertainty  linked  to  the  sharp  increase   of  oil  prices,  investment   should be less buoyant in the  second half of the year.   Private consumption is likely to decelerate, also since  the  strong  increase  of  the  first  half  of  the  year  was   partly due to exceptional  factors (energy consumption  was  particularly  strong  due  to  unusually  bad  weather   conditions).  Moreover,  the  short-term  employment   outlook  does  not  augur  well  for  consumption  in  the   coming     months:     the     latest     surveys     in     the      manufacturing  and  service  sectors  reveal  that  hiring   intentions remain at a relativ ely low level, suggesting  that    employment    growth    may    not    accelerate     significantly before 2005.   All in all, real GDP growth is projected to slow down  to  an  annualised  rate  of  le ss  than  2%  in  the  second   half  of  2004.  On  average,   real  GDP  growth  in  2004   would  still  post  a  clear  acceleration  compared  to   2003, when it reached only 0.5%.  Prospects for 2005 and 2006  Real GDP growth is forecast to diminish somewhat in  2005  and  2006.  Economic  activity  should  be  mainly   driven   by   domestic   demand,   while   the   negative    influence of net trade would gradually diminish.  Private  consumption  is  projected  to  increase  more  in   line  with  households’  real  disposable  income,  which   would  accelerate  gradually  in  2005  and  2006,  due  to   the projected recovery in  employment and wages. The  savings  ratio  of  households  is  still  expected  to  edge     down   marginally   until   next   summer.   This   would    reflect  the  introduction  of  ta x  exemptions  on  interest   payments    on    consumer    credits,    and    on    inter- generational financial transfer s which are expected to  encourage  households  to  free  up  some  savings.  In   total,  private  consumpti on  would  increase  by  1.7%   and 2.1% in 2005 and 2006 re spectively, after 2.4% in  2004.   Investment  is  projected  to  remain  relatively  dynamic   in  the  next  two  years.  It   should  still  be  supported  by   favourable     financing     conditions,     and     by     the      introduction of new tax incentiv es, notably cuts in the  taxe  professionnelle   (a  flat  local  tax  on  productive   capital)   on   new   capital   expenditure.   The   gradual    deceleration projected over the forecast period – from  3.7% in 2005 to 3.4% in 2006 - would be triggered by  a slight deterioration in demand expectations.   After losing export market  shares in 2003, mostly due  to  the  appreciation  of  the  exchange  rate  and  to  an   unfavourable  sectoral  com position  of  global  growth   (recession  in  the  electronic  and  aeronautic  sectors),   exports volumes ar e projected to increase more in line  with  export  market  growth  over  the  next  two  years.   This  better  performance  would  notably  stem  from  an   improvement   of   price   comp etitiveness.   In   such   a    context,   and   despite   the   projected   dynamism   of    imports, related to the robu stness of final demand, net  trade would no longer exert a significant drag on real  GDP growth in 2005 and 2006.  Labour markets, costs and prices   The current weakness of em ployment growth, largely  explained by the need for companies to improve their  financial  situation  and  uncertainties  concerning  the   durability  of  the  recovery,  shou ld  come  to  an  end  in   2005 and 2006. This would  allow a substantial decline  in  the  unemployment  rate,  from  9.9%  of  the  labour   force in 2004 to 9.5% in  2006 (ILO definition). Such  developments  would  be  consistent  with  a  gradual   slowdown  of  labour  produc tivity,  after  the  strong   cyclical rebound of 2004.  In  a  context  of  a  still  positive  unemployment  gap,   wage  moderation  is  expected  to  continue  in  2005.   Nevertheless, the harmonisation of the different levels  of  the  minimum  wage  induced  by  the  policies  of   reduction  in  working  time  to   35  hours  per  week  will   support  the  increase  in  real  wages  in  2005.  In  2006,   wages  should  post  a  slight  cyclical  acceleration,  in   line  with  the  improvement   of  the  situation  in  the   labour market.  As  a  consequence  of  the  moderation  in  unit  labour   costs  and  import  prices,  core  inflation  is  projected  to   remain roughly constant in 2005. A modest increase is  projected    for    2006.    Headline    inflation    should     nevertheless  decline  somewh at  in  2005  due  to  the   disappearance   of   the   impact   of   past   increases   in    tobacco  prices  (reducing  th e  inflation  rate  by  0.5   percentage  point  in  2005),  which  would  more  than   compensate for the increase in energy prices.   Government finances  The general government deficit is expected to decline  from 4.1% of GDP in 2003 to 3.7% of GDP in 2004.  The   decline   of   the   deficit   is   favoured   by   the    improvement  of  the  macroeconomic  situation,  which   will  trigger  additional  fiscal  revenues  of  about  0.3%   of   GDP   compared   to   Budget   plans.   Moreover,    discretionary measures on the tax side will contribute  to  a  reduction  in  the  def icit  by  about  0.1%  of  GDP.   The  tax  burden  is  nevertheless  expected  to  decline   marginally  –  from  43.8%  of  GDP  to  43.6%  of  GDP,   mostly  due  to  the  weakness  of  employment  growth   and its consequences for social contribution revenues.  The  ratio  of  general  government  expenditure  to  GDP   is  projected  to  decline  from  54.7%  of  GDP  to  54.2%   of  GDP.  This  assumes  that  the  expenditure  target  in   the  State  sector  will  be  respected  and  that  no  further   slippages will occur in the health and local authorities  sectors,  compared  to  those  already  acknowledged  by   the French authorities.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  projection  for  the  2004   deficit  is  exactly  the  same   as  in  Spring,  when  real   GDP  growth  for  2004  was  forecast  not  to  exceed   1.7%, as against 2.4% expected currently. This is due  to the fact that, in the m eantime, the 2003 deficit was  revised  upwards,  tax  cuts  were  implemented,  and   expenditures  were  not  kept  in  line  with  plans.  All  in   all,    according    to    Commission    calculations,    the     cyclically-adjusted    deficit    will    improve    by    0.3     percentage  point  of  GDP  in  2004,  as  against  0.8   percentage  point  initially  co mmitted  by  the  French   authorities.  The  general  gove rnment  debt  is  expected   to continue to increase from 63.7% of GDP in 2003 to  64.9% of GDP in 2004.  In 2005, the general governm ent deficit is projected to  decline   further   to   3.0%   of   GDP.   This   forecast    assumes   that   expenditure   plans   included   in   the    Finance Law for 2005 will  be  respected,  except  for  a   slippage in health expenditure, which are projected to  increase  by  4.0%,  as  against  3.2%  expected  by  the   French authorities. Indeed, alth ough the reform of the  health insurance system adopted last Summer is likely  to  trigger  substantial  savings  over  time,  the  precise   budgetary  impact  of  some  measures  is  uncertain.  On   the  revenue  side,  the  forecast  incorporates  one-off   measures  for  a  total  amount  of  0.5%  of  GDP.  These   revenues  are  related  to  the  transfer  to  the  social   security sector of the responsibility for the payment of  pensions to EDF employees. The macroeconomic and  budgetary  forecast  for  2005  is  consistent  with  an   improvement in the cyclically-adjusted balance by 0.7  percentage  point  of  GDP,  the  largest  part  of  which   reflects  however  the  impact  of  the  one-off  measures.   The risks to this government deficit forecast for 2005  are  skewed  to  the  upside.   Beyond  the  uncertainties   surrounding  macroeconomic  developments  stemming   notably  from  the  recent  incr ease  in  oil  prices,  further   expenditure  slippage  cannot  be  ruled  out,  notably  in   the health and local authorities  sectors. Moreover, this  forecast  does  not  incorporate  the  cuts  of  taxes  on   energy  announced  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  on  19   October 2004. While it is no t possible to quantify the  impact  of  these  measures  at  the  current  juncture,  it   cannot be excluded that it wo uld be sufficient to bring  the 2005 deficit forecast above 3% of GDP.  In  2006,  despite  the  fact  that  real  GDP  growth  is   expected  to  be  close  to  its  potential  rate,  the  general   government  deficit  is  proj ected  to  increas e  again  to   3.3%   of   GDP.   This   reflects   the   fact   that   the    exceptional   payments   contributing   to   the   deficit    reduction   in   2005   will   va nish   in   2006,   and   that    significant  tax  cuts  are  already  planned  for  that  year   (0.2%  of  GDP).  This  projection  is  based  on  the   assumption  that  real  gove rnment  expenditures  will   increase by about 1¾ % in real terms, to be compared  with  a  projection  of  1.2%  in  the  latest  multi-annual   budgetary projection of the French authorities. 		
November/2004	Ireland	Adjusting to sustainable growth levels 	Activity in 2004   According to preliminary national accounts, real GDP  increased by 4.1% on the year in the second quarter of  2004,   after   expanding   by   6.1%   in   the   previous    quarter.  On  the  domestic  side,  economic  activity  has   been   mixed.   While   consumer   demand   grew   only    modestly    by    comparison    with    previous    years,     investment  growth  has  been   strong  and,  in  particular,   residential building activity c ontinued to grow at high  levels. On the external side, figures for the first half of  2004   suggest   a   marked   improvement   in   exports    reflecting  a  more  favourable   trading  environment.  At   the   same   time,   imports   have   risen   more   slowly,    resulting  in  a  stronger  growth  contribution  from  net   exports  as  compared  to  2003.  As  regards  the  third   quarter   of   2004,   the   latest   purchasing   managers’    indices  for  manufacturing  an d  services  continued  to   report  increased  activity.  Confidence  indicators  also   generally  point  to  an  im provement,  although  there   have been some fluctuations in consumer sentiment.   For the year as a whole, real GDP growth is expected  to reach 5.2% in 2004, compared with 3.7% in 2003.  While   still   impressive,   the   extraordinary   growth    performance  of  the  second   half  of  the  1990s,  then   mainly  due  to  a  favourable  external  environment  and   sizeable  pool  of  available  labour,  is  unlikely  to  be   repeated. As net profit outflo ws  are  projected  to  hold   their  normal  upward  trend,  th e  corresponding  growth   rate in GNI terms is somewhat lower.   Prospects for 2005 and 2006  Growth  of  the  economy  is   expected  to  stabilise  close   to the rate commonly thought  to be sustainable in the  medium  term.  Overall,  GDP  is  projected  to  grow  by   4.8% and 5.0% in 2005 and 2006 respectively. On the  domestic  side,  private  consumption  is  underpinned   into   2005   by   healthy   em ployment   growth,   but    somewhat  lower  consumer  confidence  is  likely  to  act   as  some  offset.  In  2006 ,  private  spending  slightly   accelerates  as  it  is  assumed  to  benefit  from  a  modest   fall  in  the  savings  rate,   as  funds  in  Special  Savings   Incentive    Accounts    ( SSIA )    reach    maturity.    By     contrast,    the    contribution    to    growth    of    public     consumption is subdued by virtue of further spending  restraint.  Investment  in   equipment  should  somewhat   rebound   over   the   forecast   horizon,   following   a    sustained period of weakness since 2001. However, as  growth  in  housing  completions  is  expected  to  taper   off    after    double-digit    growth    in    2004,    fixed     investment   should   overall   tend   to   record   slower    growth  rates  in  2005  and   2006.  As  a  result,  overall   domestic  demand  growth  should  be  fairly  stable.  On   the external side, the performance of the international  economy  and  oil  prices  are  the  key  medium-term   risks. Labour market  In  2004,  employment  growth  is  set  to  strengthen  to   2.4%  on  the  year  in  response  to  improved  economic   conditions.   However,   in    view   of   the   expected    economic   activity   and   the   cap   on   public   sector    employment,  employment  gains  will  be  weaker  in   2005  and  2006.  With  a  somewhat  slower  rate  of   expansion     projected     for     the     labour     force,      unemployment  should  remain   just  under  4½%  in  the   forecast  period,  implying  fairly  tight  labour  market   conditions.   Cost and prices  In  line  with  the  available  data  for  the  first  half  of   2004, per capita compensation  is estimated to grow at  just  above  5%  on  the  year  in  2004.  Some  further   easing  in  view  of  fairly  moderate  pay  provisions  in   the  second  half  of  the  national  agreement  Sustaining   Progress      and      a      lower      contribution      from       “benchmarking” awards to public sector wage growth  (alignment  of  public  sector  wages  with  equivalent   private  sector)  is  expected  to  be  partly  offset  by   relatively tight conditions in the labour market. HICP  inflation  averaged  4.0%  in  2003  and  continued  to   decline   markedly   in   the   first   months   of   2004,    bottoming   out   in   April   ju st   under   the   euro   area    average.  HICP  inflation   has   somewhat  picked  up   since   then,   partly   reflecting   adverse   energy   price    developments, and is likely to reach 2.3% for the year  as a whole. As private spending revives further, HICP  inflation  is  expected  to  ri se  gradually  to  just  above   2½% by the end of 2006.   Public finances  The  main  measures  implemented  in  the  budget  for   2004  included  a  further  re duction  of  the  growth  rate   of   current   discretionary   expenditure,   a   return   to    positive  growth  in  capital  spending  after  a  slowdown   in 2003 and, on the revenue side, a modest increase in  indirect  taxes  and  a  partial  adjustment  to  inflation  of   the     personal     income     tax     system.     Provided      expenditures  continue  to  be   broadly  in  line  with  the   budget  and  taking  account  of  one-off  receipts  from   strengthened  tax  enforcement  and  all  other  factors   (including duties on buoy ant capital transactions), the  actual  outturn  of  the  gene ral  government  deficit  is   forecast  to  reach  around  0.2%  of  GDP.  The  deficit  is   projected  to  stabilise  at  around  ½%  of  GDP  in  2005   and  2006.  Given  the  non-indexed  nature  of  the  tax   and   social   benefit   systems,   the   no-policy   change    assumption   for   2005   is   made   operational,   in   the    absence   of   previously   announced   measures,   by    freezing average tax rates and adjusting social transfer  payments  by  the  forecast  CPI  inflation  rate  (with  a   small   top-up).   Government   debt   is   projected   to    stabilise at just under one-third of GDP. 		
November/2004	Italy	Muted and lagged response to the buoyant global environment 	The economy in 2004  Following the meagre perfo rmance in 2003, when real  GDP  grew  by  only  0.3%,  economic  activity  finally   started  to  pick  up   again  in  the  first  half  of  2004.   However,   the   pace   of   recovery   was   significantly    slower than in the rest of the euro area and appears to  rest  on  uneven  foundations.  The  driving  forces  have   not   consolidated   yet,   with   private   consumption    expenditure  exhibiting  a  fairly  unsteady  pattern,  the   inventory  cycle  tapering  off  and  exports  benefiting   with  a  long  lag  from  the  buoyancy  of  world  trade   growth.  Only  gross  fixed  capital  formation  seems  to   have embarked on a steady upward path.  Based   on   the   available   evidence,   the   economic    recovery is not likely to ga in much momentum in the  second  half  of  2004.  It  will  continue  at  a  relatively   measured  pace  and  is  expected  to  yield  an  annual   average  rate  of  economic  growth  of  1.3%,  0.8  of  a   percentage point less than the euro area average.   Despite  weak  economic  growth  and  a  still  sizeable   negative   output   gap   inflation   remained   sticky   at    around 2.3% throughout the year. As a reaction to this  and  in  view  of  the  high  pri ce  of  oil,  the  government   decided  to  freeze  a  series  of  controlled  prices  and   tariffs  in  2004.  It  also  re ached  an  agreement  with   large   retailers   to   keep    prices   of   certain   products    unchanged  until  the  end  of  the  year  on  a  voluntary   basis  in  exchange  for  the   prospect  of  new  legislation   liberalising the sector.   The  labour  market  continued  to  create  new  jobs  at  a   relatively   healthy   pace   in   the   first   part   of   2004.    According   to   the   national   accounts   statistics   the    number  of  full  time  equivalents  increased  by  0.6%   compared to the same period last year. With a view to  harmonise  national  statistics  with  EU  legislation  the   Italian Statistical Office carried out a major reform of  the  labour  force  survey  in  2004.  The  new  method   entailed  a  shift  in  the  level  of  most  labour  market   series.   The   rate   of   unem ployment   is   consistently    lower  compared  to  the  previous  labour  force  survey.   In particular, the 2003 annual average is now recorded  at 8.4%, as opposed to 8.7% before.  Growth prospects to 2006   In  view  of  the  lagged  revival  in  2004,  the  Italian   economy  is  expected  to  diverge  somewhat  from  the   cyclical  pattern  foreseen  in  the  rest  of  the  EU.  While   most   EU   economies   are   expected   to   decelerate    somewhat  in  2005  and  2 006,  echoing  the  assumed   slowdown  in  world  trade  and  global  growth,  Italy  is   projected  to  gradually  catch  up  from  behind.  Real   GDP growth is forecast to rise to 1.8% in 2005 and to  stabilise in 2006. The growth  differential vis-à-vis the  euro area average narrows but stays negative.  The  growth  projection  is  es sentially  built  upon  the   assumption   that   domestic   demand   will   eventually    steady and strengthen in view of a relatively broad set  of   favourable   fundamentals .   Private   consumption    expenditure should benefit from ongoing job creation,  real  wage  increases,  and   rising  house  prices.  In  a   similar  vein,  investment  is   expected  to  remain  on  the   upward  path  traced  out  in  2004  on  the  back  of  the   improving business confidence, low real interest rates  and rising profit margins.  No  major  improvement  is  expected  on  the  external   side, where Italian exports are likely to face the déjà- vu  of  the  recent  past.  In  particular,  the  erosion  of  ex-   port  markets  is  expected  to  continue  reflecting  the   unfavourable   specialisation    of   the   Italian   industry    coupled  with  declining  pr ice  competitiveness.  As  a   result,  net  exports  are  projected  to  act  as  a  drag  on   economic  growth  throughout  the  forecast  period.  The   size of the drag is likely to decline as the appreciation  of the euro levels out.  Costs and prices   Inflation is projected to eas e only very slowly over the  forecast horizon. Part of the stickiness will result from  the  lagged  adjustment  mechanism  for  electricity  and   gas  prices  charged  to  private  households.  This  has   dampened  the  impact  of  th e  sharp  increase  in  oil   prices  in  2004  but  will  release  the  rest  of  the  effect   over     the     course     of      2005.     Moreover,     the      aforementioned  effort  of  th e  government  to  postpone   the   increase   of   controlled   prices   as   well   as   the    negotiated  temporary  price  stop  in  parts  of  the  retail   sector are likely to trigger a rebound at the beginning  of  2005.  Subsequently,  the   still  negative  output  gap,   the  projected  increase  in   productivity  and  slowing   import prices, are expected to work their way through  to   consumer   price   inflation.   Overall,   the   annual    increase  in  the  HICP  is  likely  to  drop  below  the  2%   threshold only towards the end of 2006.  Labour market  The  measured  pace  of  economic  expansion  in  2005   and   2006   is   projected   to   be   accompanied   by   an    essentially steady annual increase of employment. As  in  the  past  several  years,   the  head  count  figures  will   grow  faster  than  the  full-time  equivalents  reflecting   the  higher  degree  of  f lexibility  ensuing  from  the   successive     stages     of     labour     market     reform      implemented since the mid-1990s. The job content of  economic growth is projected to ease somewhat as the  level  effect  resulting  from  the   reforms  is  expected  to   peter   out,   giving   way   to   a   more   traditional   link    between    GDP    and    employment    growth.    The     ‘normalisation’  of  the  labour  market  is  also  expected   to   flatten   the   downward   trend   in   the   rate   of    unemployment.  Public finances  The  general  government  defi cit  is  estimated  to  reach   3.0%  of  GDP  in  2004,  as  compared  to  2.4%  of  GDP   in  2003  and  to  an   initial  target  of  2.2%  of  GDP.  A   sizable  decrease  in  interest   expenditure  falls  short  to   compensate  a  marked  deterioration  of  the  primary   surplus, which is forecast to drop to 2.0% of GDP. In  cyclically-adjusted  terms   both  the  budget  deficit  and   the primary surplus deteriorate significantly compared  to 2003.   The   budgetary   outturn   in   2004   also   reflects   a    declining    contribution    from    one-off    measures.     Specifically, in 2003 temporary measures reduced the  deficit  by  more  than  2  percentage  points  of  GDP.  In   2004,    higher    than    planned    revenues    from    tax     amnesties are expected to offset the limited success of  other temporary measures, i.e. the amnesty for zoning  code violations and sale  of publicly-owned real assets.  In  the  Commission  forecast,  the  total  impact  of  one- off  measures  amounts  to  around  1½  pp  of  GDP  in   2004.  The  Commission  deficit  forecast  of  3%  for  2004  is   marginally  above  the  official  target  of  2.9%  of  GDP   because of a residual uncertainty attached to a part of  the  very  recently  disclosed  administrative  measures   complementing    the    additional    fiscal    correction     announced in July this year.  In 2005, the general governm ent deficit is projected to  remain  at  3%  of  GDP,  while  the  primary  surplus  is   expected  to  improve  marginally  to  2.1%.  As  the   output   gap   is   projected   to   narrow   in   2005   this    projection    would    entail    a    deterioration    of    the     underlying  budgetary  positi on  as  measured  by  the   cyclically-adjusted budget balance.   The    Commission    forecast    presupposes    a    full     implementation  of  the  fiscal  adjustment  presented  in   the  draft  2005  budg et  which  is  officially  expected  to   close   the   gap   between   the   unchanged   legislation    deficit  of  4.4%  of  GDP  and  the  target  of  2.7%  of   GDP.  The  target  is  1.2  percentage  point  higher  than   the  objective  presented  in   the  2003  updated  stability   programme.  The  difference  between  the  Commission   deficit forecast and the government target is due to the  following   two   elements.   First,   the   draft   budget    assumes an increase in real GDP of 2.1% as compared  to   1.8%   in   the   Commi ssion   scenario.   The   lower    growth  projection  accounts  for  one  decimal  point  of   the  deficit  to  GDP  ratio.  Second,  the  remaining  two   decimal   points   of   the   difference   in   the   deficit    projection  refer  to  a  classification  issue.  The  Italian   Government    has    classifi ed    ANAS,    the    public     company in charge of the maintenance of state roads,  outside  the  general  government  sector  as  of  2005.   However,  at  this  stage  it  seems  unlikely  that  ANAS   will  meet  the  ESA95  conditions  to  qualify  as  part  of   the private sector in that year.   The  Commission  deficit  projection  for  2005  does  not   incorporate  the  repeatedly  announced  tax  cuts,  as  no   measures  were  officially  adopted  before  the  cut-off   date of this forecast.   The  balance  of  risks  is  clearly  skewed  towards  a   higher deficit in 2005. The  authorities plan to achieve  a   large   fiscal   correction   combined   with   a   deficit    neutral   tax   cut.   Overall,   this   strategy   entails   an    adjustment of around 2¼ % of GDP, the largest of the  current  legislative  period.  Implementation  of  the  2%   ceiling  on  the  nominal  annual  increase  in  primary   expenditure  excluding  pens ions  -  the  main  pillar  of   the  fiscal  adjustment  -  will  prove  very  challenging   especially in health care. Even a small deviation from  budget  plans  will  imply  a  deficit  above  the  3%  of   GDP reference value.  Following  established  prac tice,  the  deficit  projection   for  2006  of  3.6%  of  GDP  is  based  on  unchanged   legislation.  In  spite  of  privatisation   and  securitisation  proceeds   amounting to 1.5% of GDP, the debt ratio is projected  to  decline  by  only  0.2  percentage  point  in  2004,  to   106%   of   GDP.   In   2005,   the   debt   is   forecast   to    decrease    to    104.6%    of    GDP,    discounting    the     announced  disposal  of  financial  assets  estimated  at   around  1.8%  of  GDP.  The  same  volume  of  disposals   is  expected  in  2006 ,  when  the  debt  ratio  is  projected   to decline by a mere 0.2% of GDP. 		
November/2004	Cyprus	Growth picking up and fiscal consolidation  	The economy in 2003   The  unfavourable  external  environment  continued  to   negatively  affect  tourism  in  2003.  As  in  2002,  real   GDP  growth  reached  2%.  Economic  activity  was   mainly   driven   by   domestic   demand,   notably   in    government     and     construction     investment     and      consumption  (notably  public  sector  wages)  as  fiscal   policy  turned  more  expansionary,  widening  the  fiscal   deficit    to    6.4%    of    GDP.    Private    consumption     increased  by  2.4%,  underpin ned  by  rising  disposable   income linked to high wage growth, continuing near- full  employment  conditions,  and  aided  by  tax  reform   (including  lower  marginal   income  tax  rates).  Private   investment   dropped   by   mo re   than   3%.   However,    corrected  for  purchases  of  ships  and  aircraft  in  2002,   investment  increased  by  about  4%,  mainly  driven  by   investment in construction and machinery/equipment.  Demand  was  further  supported  through  lower  real   interest    rates,    resulting    from    slightly    increased     inflation  rates  and  a  0.5%  nominal  rate  decrease  in   April 2003.  Tourist  arrivals  declined   by  nearly  5%,  linked  to  the   Iraq   war,   SARS   and   low   EU   growth.   Moreover    receipts fell by 10%, due to price discounts. Together  with  slow  growth  in  Midd le  East  export  markets  and   deteriorating  competitiveness  as  the  Cyprus  pound   (linked  to  the  euro)  appreciated  vis-à-vis  the  dollar   and  pound,  total  real  export  growth  remained  near- stagnant. Modest domestic demand and export growth  made  imports  drop  by  1%,  while  the  terms  of  trade   improved  slightly.  Altogether,  the  current  account   (CA) deficit decreased to 3.5% of GDP.  Prospects   The  forecast  for  2004  projects  a  modest  rebound  in   real  GDP  growth  to  3.5%.  The  recovery  is  mainly   domestic-demand  led,  but  the  slightly  more  positive   2004 growth prospects for the EU (especially the UK  and  Germany,  Cyprus’  main   tourist  source  countries)   also  support  this  outlook.  Th e  rebound  is  expected  to   strengthen  somewhat  further  in  2005  and  2006  to   around   4%.   External   demand   (tourism)   is   also    projected to accelerate after the sluggish expansion so  far. However, uncertainties rema in, notably in tourism  and    oil    price    developments,    where    Cyrus    is     vulnerable.   Hence,   given   the   fragile   international    growth   outlook,   the   forecast   remains   cautious   on    tourist arrivals and receipts.   GDP components   The  gradual  recovery  starting  in  the  2 nd   half  of  2003   strengthened  in  early  2004 ,  with  GDP  growth  in  Q1   and  Q2  at  y-o-y  3.6%  an d  4.1%  respectively.  For   2004  consumption  growth  is  projected  at  3.2%  while   for  2005-2006  marginally  hi gher  rates  are  foreseen,   stimulated   by   much   the   same   factors   as   2003.    Recovering investment growth  in 2004 is expected to  reach   5.3%   and   then   continue   to   show   vigorous    growth  for  the  remainder  of  the  period,  given  that   structural   growth   factors   such   as   EU   accession,    ongoing  liberalisation  and  restructuring  in  financial   and   utilities   markets   and   planned   infrastructure    projects (airports in Larnaca and Paphos and a port in  Larnaca) are still in place.   Tourism  has  been  recovering  markedly  more  slower   than   expected   so   far.   Arrivals   in   Jan-September    increased   by   only   2.9%,   (well)   below   historical    growth  rates.  With  strengthening  domestic  demand   and   import   growth,   the   CA   deficit   for   2004   is    projected  to  rise  to  4.5%   of  GDP  and  then  to  decline   to  3.7%  by  2006,  linked  to  modest  export  recovery,   fiscal  consolidation,  and  –for  2006-improving  terms   of trade.   Costs and prices, labour market  Following increases in VAT  and excise duties in line  with the EU  acquis , inflation increased  to 4% in 2003,  although the appreciation of the  pound and the drop in  industrial import prices tempered price pressures. For  Jan-September    2004,    inflation    stood    at    1.6%     compared to the same period in 2003.   For both 2004 and 2005, inf lation is expected to reach  2.4%, linked also to oil price pressures, before inching  down  to  2.1%  by  2006,  in  line  with  previous  VAT- related   inflation   spikes.    To   counter   devaluation    rumours  related  to,   inter  alia ,  political  uncertainty   after  the  Greek  Cypriot  ‘No’  vote  to  the  UN  Annan   plan  and  capital  outflow  ri sks  following  full  capital   liberalisation on the eve of EU accession, the Central  Bank  of  Cyprus  in  April  increased  interest  rates  by   1%-point.  The  Cyprus  pound   remained  stable  against   the  euro  and  in  subsequent  months,  capital  outflows   reversed again.   Unemployment  increased  to  4.4%  in  2003  but  is   expected to move downward again to below 4% in the  forecast  period  as  growth  picks  up.  It  can  also  be   noted that the limited border opening with the Turkish  Cypriot  community  (T/C)  in  the  North  has  led  to  an   increasing  share  of  daily  commuting  T/C  workers  in   total employment (to about 1%).  Public finances   Government  revenues  in  Ja n-August  2004  increased   by  15%  and  expenditure  by  0.5%  compared  to  the   same   period   last   year.    However,   major   parts   of    expenditure  takes  place  at  the  end  of  the  year,  while   there  have  been  delays   in  introducing  some  2004   fiscal  consolidation  revenue  measures.  Nevertheless,   given these results, the forecast expects that the 2004  deficit  target  of  5.2%  of  GDP  will  be  met.  For  2005   the deficit is projected at 3.0% of GDP or marginally  above the Convergence Programme (CP) target, given  the Commission’s slightly more cautious GDP growth  projection. Similarly, for 2006, the forecast projects a  deficit  of  2.4%  or  slightly  higher  than  in  the  CP,   mainly   due   to   a   relatively   lower   projected   GDP    growth. 		
November/2004	Latvia	Continuous robust growth but with some imbalances 	Recent developments in activity  In  2003,  GDP  growth  was  7.5%  (6.4%  in  2002).   Private consumption and gross fixed capital formation  have  been  the  driving  factors  for  growth.  Strong   private  consumption  was  supported  by  employment   growth, rising real wages and increased bank lending.  Gross  fixed  capital  formation  remained  buoyant  as  a   result  of  favourable  credit   conditions  and  reinforced   macroeconomic   stability.   Th e   first   half   of   2004    produced  further  expansion.  Growth  in  the  first  two   quarters  was  8.8%  and  7.7%  respectively  (y-o-y).   Exports  grew  4.3%  y-o-y ;  however,  imports  grew   three times faster (13.9%), widening the already large  external deficit.   Prospects for 2004-2006  Growth  prospects  for  2004-2006  are  strong  with  an   expected growth rate of 7½% in 2004 and just below  7%  in  2005  and  2006.  Final  domestic  demand  is   expected  to  drive  growth,  primarily  led  by  increases   in   private   consumption   on   the   back   of   sustained    increases  in  real  disposable  income  and  better  credit   access.   Over   the   entire   forecast   period,   private    consumption  is  expected  to  continue  to  show  healthy   growth peaking in 2004 follo wed by a slight easing in  2005 and 2006. The expansion of investment is likely  to  remain  high  over  the  fo recast  period  with  housing   investment increasing strongly.  The   recovery   of   the   EU   economy   and   positive    externalities of Latvia’s accession to the EU will keep  export  growth  strong.  Nevertheless,  import  growth  is   expected  to  remain  robust  due  to  the  increase  of   investment and intermediate  goods reflecting buoyant  investment   and   strong    growth   of   manufacturing.    Thus, for 2004 the negative  growth contribution from  net    exports    remains    considerable    at    about    3     percentage    points.    Although    import    growth    is     expected  to  slow  somewhat  in  2005,  allowing  for  a   slight   narrowing   of   the   trade   balance,   the   net    contribution   to   GDP   growth   from   trade   is   also    expected to be considerable and negative in 2005 and  2006.  Accordingly,  real  GDP  is  expected  to  grow  at   around 7% in all forecast years.  Labour market, costs and prices  High    growth    has    contributed    to    lowering    the         unemployment   rate,   though    upward   pressure   on    unemployment from enterprise and rural restructuring  is  expected  to  persist.  In  spite  of  a  strong  growth   performance,  and  sizeable  employment  gains  since   2001,  the  unemployment  rate  thus  remains  at  around   10%  of  the  labour  force  and  is  forecast  to  drop  only   slightly  in  the  medium   term.  Moderate  employment   gains of around ½% per year over the forecast period  will  contribute  to  the  declin e,  although  considerable   regional  development  disparities  will  hold  back  a   faster improvement in labour market conditions.   Since  summer  2003  inflatio n  has  been  rising.  The   pick  up  of  prices  has  been   reflected  in  all  inflation   indices,   with   that   for   pr oducer   prices   starting   to    outpace  consumer  prices.  For  2003  inflation  reached   2.9%,  up  from  2.0%  in  2002.  This  was  partly  due  to   higher  regulated  prices  for  gas,  heating  and  rent  as   well as to a sharp rise in healthcare costs. Imports also  became more expensive. Price levels accelerated even  further  in  the  first  quarter  of  2004.  The  inflation   increase in 2004 is largely the consequence of one-off  events,   such   as   EU   entry-related   tax   and   price    adjustments,  and  a  significant  depreciation  of  the  lats   vis-à-vis the euro at the end of 2003. The main risk to  the  inflation  outlook  is  th at  price  increases  could   become persistent if strong demand continues to drive  output   above   potential   and   feed   into   inflation    expectations.  Taking  this  in to  account,  inflation  is   expected  to  reach  6.8%  in  2004  and  to  fall  back  to  a   about 3½% in 2006.  The external account  Given  the  net  export  performance  noted  above,  the   current  account  deficit  increased  to  8.6%  of  GDP  in   2003.   In   2004   the  c urrent   account   balance  will   deteriorate  further  to  about  10%  of  GDP  due  to  a   disproportionate  rise  in  imports  of  goods  prior  to   Latvia’s  accession  to  the  European  Union,  and  the   purchase  of  new  vessels  adding  1.5%  of  GDP  to  the   current  account  deficit.  Latvia’s  external  balance  will   improve  as  soon  as  modernization  of  the  economy   allows   an   increase   in   share   of   high   value-added    exports.    However,    during    the    forecast    period     investment needs will dominate and improvement will  be  gradual.  The  worsening  of  the  trade  balance  is   expected  to  be  compensate d  by  increasing  surplus  on   the  services  account,  thus  the  current  account  deficit   will  remain  roughly  at  th e  same  level  throughout  the   forecast period. The sectoral net lending position will  improve relative to the curre nt account, reflecting the  build-up of capital transfer s received from the EU.  Public finances  The  general  government  defi cit  in  2003  decreased  to   1.5%  of  GDP  largely  due  to  better  than  expected  tax   revenues.  In  August  2004   the  Latvian  Parliament   approved  amendments  to  the  budget  law  to  provide   for  additional  expenditure  in   2004  of  approximately   0.9%  of  GDP.  Nevertheless,  the  budget  deficit  is   expected to remain within  the target of 2% of GDP in  the  light  of  very  strong  growth  and  an  emerging  tax   overshoot  in  the  first  half  of  2004.  For  the  forecast   period  a  broadening  of  the  indirect  tax  base  should   outweigh  the  cut  in  the  corp orate  income  tax  rate  in   force  since  January  2004.  However,  the  draft  2005   budget  law  as  adopted  in  September  represents  a   marked   shift   towards   a   more   expansionary   fiscal    policy.   Consequently,   in   the   absence   of   budget    amendments,   the   deficit   could   be   expected   to    approach 3% of  GDP in 2005-2006. 		
November/2004	Lithuania	Strong growth with pressures on the external and fiscal balances 	Recent developments  The Lithuanian economy continued to expand briskly  in  recent  months.  After  increasing  by  9.7%  in  2003,   real  output  expanded  furthe r  by  7.2%  in  the  first  half   of 2004 against the same period of the previous year.  Growth  continued  to  be  driven  by  domestic  demand,   as  the  pace  of  expansion  of  investment  and  private   consumption  remained  particularly  rapid  in  the  wake   of   EU   accession-related   investment   projects,   very    strong credit growth and an improving labour market.   Although  foreign  trade  data   in  2004  are  not  fully   comparable  with  2003  due  to  methodology  changes,   data  available  point  to  an  acceleration  of  exports  in   the  first  half  of  2004  that  was  amply  outpaced  by   import growth. Preliminary estimations set the current  account  deficit  at  some  10%  of  GDP  in  the  first  half   of   2004,   largely   due   to   a   widening   trade   deficit    induced by the investment and consumption surge and  a build-up of stocks in anticipation of higher taxes for  certain     imported     goods     after     EU     accession.      Lithuania’s  contribution  to   the  EU  budget  in  the   second quarter contributed further to the deterioration.  A  significant  increase  in  foreign  direct  investment   flows  in  the  first  half  of  the  year  has  contributed  to   partly finance the deficit increase.  The  deflationary  trend  initiated   in  2002  reversed  in   the second quarter of 2004,  mainly reflecting a strong  contribution   from   oil   and   food   prices   and   tax    alignments  required  upon  accession.  Labour  demand   remained  buoyant  in  the  pr ivate  sector  and  led  to  a   further  decrease  in  the  unemployment  rate,  which  is   estimated to have fallen below 12.5% in the first half  of 2004.  Growth prospects   Real   GDP   growth   is   expected   to   remain   robust,    sustained     by     continued     buoyancy     in     private      consumption  and  investment,  but  growth  is  foreseen   to  moderate  gradually  from  7.1%  in  2004  to  5.9%  in   2006.  Domestic  demand  growth  is  estimated  to  slow   down  progressively  in  2005-2006,  partly  in  response   to   the   reduced   stimulus   from   fiscal   policy   and    increasing interest rates.   GDP  growth  is  expected  to  become  more  balanced   towards  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon,  with  the   contribution  of  net  exports   gradually  improving  after   a   sharp   deterioration   in   2004.   Export   growth   is    foreseen  to  accelerate  in  2005-2006  on  the  back  of   increasing  external  demand  and  expanded  production   capacity. The government’s fiscal consolidation plans  in  2006  and  an  expected  moderation  of  the  present   credit  growth  dynamics  are  likely  to  contribute  to   improve Lithuania’s savings- investment balance, with  the  current  account  deficit  decreasing  to  about  7.9%   of GDP from an expected peak of 8.7% in 2004.  Labour market, costs and prices   Inflation   is   expected   to   accelerate   further   in   the    second  half  of  2004,  but  the  annual  average  inflation   rate  is  forecast  to  increase  only  moderately  by  1.2%.   Higher  oil,  transport  and  health  prices,  coupled  with   the  effect  of  tax  alignments  due  to  EU  accession,  are   expected  to  continue  leading  the  increase  in  inflation   in the last months of 2004. Annual average inflation is  expected to accelerate further in 2005-2006 and reach  2.8-2.9%,  under  the  impact  of  higher  wage  inflation   and price increases in the regulated sectors and public  transport.   Overall,  the  labour  market  is  expected  to  improve  in   line  with  the  rapid  economic  expansion  and  more   active  labour  market  policies  co -financed  by  the  EU.   Employment  growth  is  foreseen  to  remain  relatively   strong,  driven  by  firm  la bour  demand  by  the  private   sector. The unemployment rate is expected to decline  gradually from 12.7% in 2003 to 9.9% in 2006.  Wage  growth  is  expected  to  accelerate  during  the  forecast   horizon  with  some  pressure  on  unit  labour  costs  as  a   consequence.  Public finance  Recently    revised    data    show    that    the    general     government  deficit  increased  from  1.5%  of GDP in 2002  to  1.9%  in  2003,  undershooting  the  2.4%  of   GDP target foreseen in the budget for 2003.  The   general   government   deficit   is   expected   to    increase  significantly  in  2004  to  2.6%  of  GDP.  The   main  factors  contributing  to  the  deficit  increase  are  a   sharp  increase  in  capital  e xpenditure  led  by  new   investment  projects  co-financed  by  the  EU,  higher   public  consumption  driven  by  salary  increases  for   public   sector   workers,   the   transition   costs   of   the    pension  reform  and  a  significant  increase  in  social   welfare     benefits     and     subsidies.     Government      investment   and   current   expenditure   growth   are    expected  to  remain  robust  in  2004-2005,  due  to  co- financing   of   EU   structural   and   cohesion   funds    projects,  further  salary  increases  in  the  public  sector   and rising pensions and social welfare benefits.  Revenue  growth  is  expect ed  to  be  strong  over  the   forecast  period,  particularly  income  and  wealth  taxes   and  social  contributions,  on  the  back  of  increasing   minimum  and  average  salaries,  growing  employment   and  rising  corporate  profits.  The  forecast  assumes   that,   after   the   initial   deterioration   of   the   general    government     deficit,     the     government     remains      committed  to  fiscal  consolida tion,  which  is  expected   to  play  a  role  in  containing  external  imbalances  and   smooth    household    consumption.    The    deficit    is     projected  to  decrease  from  2.5%  of  GDP  in  2005  to   1.9%    in    2006,    when    public    consumption    and     investment  growth  are  expected  to  slow  down,  as  the   initial   impact   of   accession   on   public   investment    gradually  fades.  The  deficit  projection  for  2006  also   assumes  a  lower  increase  in  social  spending  and   salaries   than   in   2004    and   2005.   Several   factors    introduce     some     uncertainty     for     the     general      government deficit forecast, particularly the transition  costs  of  the  pension  reform  and  the  impact  of  the   change of VAT collection upon EU accession.  		
November/2004	Luxembourg	Still growing faster than its neighbours 	The situation in 2003 and 2004  Growth  in  Luxembourg  was  significantly  stronger  in   recent years than had been previously thought as real  GDP rose by 1.5% in 2001 and 2.5% in 2002 (revised  data)   and   by   2.9%   in   2003   according   to   a   first    estimate.    Once    again,    Luxembourg    has    thus     succeeded  in  keeping  a  significant  positive  growth   differential  with  its  neigh bours.  Private  consumption   was  rather  subdued  in  2003   as  the  positive  effects  of   the  2001-2002  tax  cuts  had  probably  for  a  large  part   faded  away.  Investment  decreased  by  more  than  6%   but   only   because   of   a   drop   in   the   purchase   of    airplanes  by  Luxembourg-ba sed  airlines.  Exports  of   goods  decreased  too  but  also  because  of  exceptional   factors,  namely  a  fall  in  the  re-exports  of  cellular   telephones.   This   rather   strong   activity   resulted   in   a   rise   in    domestic  employment  by  3%  in  2002  (after  5.7%  in   2001) and 1.8% in 2003, which was much faster than  in  neighbouring  countries.  Like  in  previous  years,   however,  national  employment  only  rose  by  about   1%,  while  the  number  of  non-residents  working  in   Luxembourg, in comparison, increased by nearly 4%.  Consequently,  job  creation   was  not  strong  enough  to   prevent  a  further  increase  in  unemployment,  which   rose from 2.8% of active population in 2002 to 3.7%.  There    are    no    quarterly    national    accounts    in     Luxembourg   but   all   availa ble   indicators   show   a    significant  acceleration  in  growth  this  year.  Industry   is performing very well with the steel sector recording  exceptional growth rates. Construction is buoyant too,  with  the  sole  exception  of   public  works  which  had   been  rising  very  fast  in  recent  years  due  to  a  strong   increase  in  government  investment.  In  the  financial   sector,  activity  has  stopped  decreasing  and  is  posting   positive  growth  rates  since  the  first  half  of  2004.   Moreover,  both  private  consumption  and  investment   should  accelerate,  the  former  because  it  grew  below   its long term average in 2003 and both job creation as  well  as  wage  increases  should  boost  it,  the  latter   because  its  fall  last  year  was  only  due  to  incidental   factors. The creation of jobs is accelerating again, rising year- on-year  by  more  than  2%  in  the  latest  months.  As   usual,  this  entails  a  significantly  slower  increase  in   residents  employment  (about  1%  in  annual  terms  at   the  moment)  and  a  much  faster  rise  in  the  number  of   non-resident  workers  (more  than  4%  a  year  in  recent   months).  Inflation  has  been  accelerating  in  recent  months  but   mostly   due   to   the   rise   in   oil   prices   and   to   the    exceptionally high weight of  oil products in the HICP  in  Luxembourg:  the  annual  rate  of  increase  in  the   HICP, which was 2.5% on av erage in 2003, jumped to  between  3½%  and  4%  since  May.  However,  the  rise   in  the  national  CPI  (fro m  which  purchases  by  non   residents  are  excluded,  especially  their  substantial   purchases  of  car  fuel  and   tobacco)  is  still  in  the   neighbourhood of 2.5%, as  against 2% in 2003.  Prospects for 2005 and 2006    GDP  growth  is  expected  to  decelerate  slightly  in   2005  and  to  remain  more  or   less  at  the  same  level  in   2006:  whereas  private  consumption  should  continue   to  speed  up  in  line  with   job  creation,  the  external   environment is likely to be  less supportive with export  market  growth  slowing  down  slightly.  Investment   should  be  rather  buoyant  but  the  small  size  of  the   country  makes  it  extremely  erratic  and  difficult  to   forecast. In  the  light  of  the  expected  acceleration  in  activity,   employment   growth,   too,   should   slightly   increase    over  the  forecast  period.  As  a  result,  unemployment   should  probably  stop  rising  next  year  and  could  even   begin  to  decrease  in  2006.  However,  this  decrease   might  happen  later  and  be  slower  than  the  rapid   growth  in  employment  would  suggest:  there  seem  to   be  increasing  signs  of  mismatches  between  the  skills   of   the   unemployed   and   th ose   required   by   firms;    Moreover,  due  to  higher  wages  and  unemployment   benefits  in  Luxembourg,  the  reservation  wages  of   residents   are   clearly   higher   than   those   of   non    residents,  which  favours  the  latter  in  the  competition   for available jobs.  Inflation   should   slow   down   slightly   during   the    forecast  period  in  line  with  the  expected  decrease  in   oil  prices,  with  the  HICP  slowing  more  than  the   national  CPI  because  of  the  larger  weight  of  oil   products.  Public finances  Last  March,  Luxembourg  authorities  had  reported  a   very slight deficit (0.1% of GDP) for 2003. However,  it  turns  out  that  this  wa s  actually  a  0.8%  of  GDP   surplus  due  to  better-than-expected  revenues  from   both  indirect  and  direct  taxes  but  also  to  lower  than   projected  expenditure,  especi ally  investment  by  local   authorities.    For    this    year,    reportings    by    the     Luxembourg  authorities  show  a  deficit  at  about  1.9%   of  GDP.  However,  tax  revenues  seem  more  buoyant   than projected because of faster-than-expected growth  and  of  the  relatively  rapid  rise  in  wages.  As  a  result,   the  deficit  should  be  significantly  lower  than  was   expected up to now.  There  is  no  budget  yet  for   2005  and,  due  to  the  June   general election, it will not be  submitted to Parliament  before October 20th. Consequently, the projection for  2005 and 2006 is purely technical and based on a “no  policy change” assumption. Its main feature is that the  rise  in  revenues  would  gradually  accelerate  over  the   forecast  period  while  expenditure  would  slow  down   from  the  high  rates  of  increase  recorded  in  recent   years.  However,  spending  wo uld  still  be  rising  faster   than receipts at the end of the period. As a result - and  bar a faster-than-expected increase in revenues (which  is  often  the  case  in  Luxemb ourg)  -  the  deficit  should   progressively widen. 		
November/2004	Hungary	Favourable shift in growth components 	The situation in 2004   The pick-up of real GDP growth continued in the first  half  of  2004  with  year-on-year  real  growth  rates  of   over  4%.  This  dynamism  is  e xpected  to  continue  in   the  second  half  of  the  year  and  to  result  in  an  annual   real  GDP  growth  rate  of  close  to  4%.  Since  the  last   quarter    of    2003,    real     GDP    growth    has    been     increasingly based on strongly accelerating export and  investment   growth.   At   the   same   time,   private    consumption,  which  had  bolstered  GDP  growth  in   recent  years,  more  than  halved  due  to  a  significant   decrease in net disposable income.   Following   three   years   of   strong   wage   increases , p ublic   real   wages   decelerated   in   2004   and   even    slightly declined below zero . After a strong slowdown  in  the  first  half  of  2004,  private  wages  picked  up  in   the  second  half  of  the  year.  Consumer  price  inflation   accelerated  sharply  to  a  level  of  around  7%  in  2004.   In  the  first  quarter  of  2004   the  increase  was  mainly   related to indirect tax increases and price adjustments,  while  supply-side  factors  (rising  oil  and  unprocessed   food  prices)  accounted  for  the  high  levels  in  the   second quarter. The moderate  disinflation of the third  quarter is expected to continue.   Unemployment  remains  slightly  below  6%.  Despite   some  fiscal  tightening,  the  current  account  deficit  is   forecast to remain at about 9% of GDP in 2004. This  is largely due to the widening of the trade deficit and  the  deceleration  of  private  consumption  growth.  The   acceleration  of  import  growth  in  the  first  half  of  the   year  might  have  partly  been  related  to  pre-purchases   before  Hungary’s  EU-accession.  It  is  expected  to   remain  dynamic  for  the  remainder  of  the  year,  given   the high import share of the  strongly growing exports.   Growth prospects for 2005 and 2006  Real  GDP  growth  is  forecast  to  remain  solid  in  the   forecast  period,  based  further  on  exports,  investment   and    consumption.    Export    growth,    however,    is     expected  to  slightly  slow   down  after  the  strong  2004   performance.    After    easing    somewhat    in    2005,     investment  growth  is  expect ed  to  be  boosted  by  EU   related investment. Given the moderate growth of real  disposable income, private consumption is forecast to  grow    only    moderately    above    3%    during    the     forecasting period, with an upward risk in the election  year 2006.  Following   their   significant   deceleration   in   2004,    public wages are forecast to increase only marginally  in the remaining forecast pe riod. Private sector wages  would  grow  faster,  against  the  risk  of  bottlenecks  in   the labour market. The unemployment rate is forecast  to  decline  slightly  from  5. 9%  of  the  labour  force  in   2004  to  5.8%  by  2006.  Employment  would  continue   to   grow   by   around   ½%   per   year.   The   moderate    disinflation  that  started  in  the   second  half  of  2004  is   expected  to  accelerate  sharply  in  the  first  months  of   2005  due  to  base  effects.   A  further  continuous  but   moderate  disinflation  is  projected  for  the  remaining   forecast period.   Balance of payment developments  The  moderate  domestic  demand  growth  and  some   fiscal tightening will contribute to some narrowing of  the current account deficit, but it would still remain at  around 8½ % of GDP by 2006 1 . Public finances  The   reduction   of   the   general   government   deficit    continued in 2004. However, despite the higher-than- expected   real   GDP   growth   in   2004,   the   official    general government deficit ta rget of 4.6% of GDP for  this  year  will  be  missed.  This  was  acknowledged  by   the  upward  revision  of  the  of ficial  target  to  5.3%  of   GDP. The slippage can be attributed to higher-than-  expected   VAT   and   personal   income   tax   revenue    shortfalls  and  higher-than-forecast  expenditures.  The   Commission  forecasts  with  5.5%  of  GDP  a  slightly   higher deficit than the revised official target. As  for  the  remainder  of  the  forecast  period,  several   measures   (which   were   partly   carried   out   in   the    previous  years,  but  will  only  have  fiscal  effects  in   2005  or  2006)  shou ld  help  to  contain  overspending   and  revenue  shortfall  as  experienced  in  the  last  two   years.  These  measures  are  notably  the  narrowing  of   the   eligibility   criteria   for   ho using   loans   and   tax    exemptions,    an    agreement    with    pharmaceutical     producers  on  the  maximum  amount  of  subsidies,  the   ongoing  downsizing  of  public  employees.  The  fact   that  a  large  majority  of  the  public  investment  is   planned   to   be   carried   out   as   a   public   private    partnership  project,  should  result  in  a  one  off  saving   effect in 2005.  However, there are also indications that no substantial  consolidation  can  be  expected  for  the  rest  of  the   forecast  period.  While  the  foreseen  cuts  in  personal   income tax are not fully compensated by the increase  of   other   taxes,   resulting   in   a   decline   of   the    revenue/GDP  ratio,  there  is  still  the  risk  of  overly   optimistic  assumptions  for  certain  revenues  (mainly   VAT).  Also,  the  budget  is  burdened  by  high  net   interest payments, accounting for about 4½% of GDP.  Moreover,  the  more  substantive  expenditure  saving   structural   reforms   announced   in   the   convergence    programme  have  not  yet  been  effectively  addressed.   The    double    election    year    of    2006    indicates,     furthermore, the risk of highe r current expenditure on  central  and  local  government  level  in  both  2005  and   2006.  Gross  debt  will  remain  slightly  below  60%  of   GDP during the forecast period. 		
November/2004	Malta	Paving the way for economic recovery 	Recent economic developments in 2004  Real  GDP  grew  by  0.2%  in  2003,  mostly  stemming   from  both  private  and  public  consumption  and  gross   fixed  capital  formation.  The  GFCF  growth  rate  was   artificially  inflated  by  the  base  effect  of  a  one-off   operation  (the  disposal  of  an  aircraft  of  Air  Malta)   registered  as  a  negative  investment  in  2002.  The   change in stocks added notably to the GDP growth as  well,  whereas  the  external   sector  contribution  was   negative.   After reaching  2.3% in the first quarter, GDP growth  could not maintain momentum and fell by 1.5% in the  second  quarter.  In  the  first  half  of  2004,  private   consumption  remained  sluggish,  partly  because  of   high household spending in th e last quarter of 2003 in  anticipation  to  the  rise  in  the  VAT  standard  rate  as   from   2004.   For   the   year    as   a   whole,   private    consumption  is  expected  to  fall  slightly  due  to  the   uncertain   economic   environment,   whereas   public    consumption  is  set  to  decelerate  significantly.  As  a   consequence of ongoing fiscal consolidation, the main  contribution  to  GDP  growth,  however,,comes  from   gross  fixed  capital  formation,  which  albeit  briskly   decelerating,  is  set  to  grow  by  7%,  mainly  due  to   infrastructure  investment.  Overall,  domestic  demand   is expected to positively c ontribute to growth (1.5%),  although partially offset by  a negative contribution of  stockbuilding of half a percentage point.    Within this scenario of domestic demand, imports are  projected   to   slowdown   substantially.   Conversely,    exports   are   set   to   pick   up   sharply   due   to   more    dynamic  world  demand.  As  a  result,  the  external   sector   is   foreseen   to   r ecord   a   slightly   positive    contribution to GDP growth, which should post a rate  of 1% in 2004, up  from 0.2% in 2003.  Prospects for 2005 and 2006   For  2005  and  2006,  private  consumption  is  expected   to gain momentum and thus become the main growth  driving   force.   However,   public   consumption   is    projected  to  keep  decelerating  and  stay  rather  flat.   Furthermore,    the    gradual    completion    of    public     investment  projects  will  moderate  investment.  All  in   all,  the  joint  contribution  of  domestic  demand  and   stockbuilding   should   rema in   almost   changed   at    around   1%.   Conversely   the   contribution   of   the    external  sector  is  foreseen  to  increase  gradually  to   reach   almost   1%   stemming   mainly   from   exports    recovery. On these bases, GDP growth is set to speed  up to 1.5% and 1.8% in  2005 and 2006, respectively.    Costs and prices  The  sharp  increase  in  oil   prices  has  not  yet  fully   impacted  on  costs  and  prices  due  to  the  time  lag   between price rises in the  international market and the  moment  they  are  reflected  to  the  internal  energy   prices.  Despite  subdued  internal  demand  the  HICP   will  raise  to  3.7%  in  2004,  reflecting  higher  fuel   prices  and  the  increase  of  VAT  rates.  The  impact  of   the  latter  will  dilute  in   2005  and  2006,  bringing  the   HICP down to 3.1% and 2.6% respectively.    Labour market  In  accordance  with  sluggish  economic  activity,  job   creation  will  remain  modest.  Moreover,  slow  growth   and   on-going   restructuring   in   the   manufacturing    sector are likely to increase the unemployment rate to  8.4%    in    2004.    As    economic    recovery    gains     momentum  and  the  real  unit  labour  costs  increases   remain    modest,    the    unemployment    rate    should     gradually improve in the subsequent years.  External accounts  The  current  account  deficit  is  set  to  narrow  to  4%  of   GDP  in  2004  from  5.3%  of  GDP  in  2003,  as  a  result   of stronger exports. The  predicted economic recovery,  partly  sustained  by  external  demand,  should  entail  a   declining   current   account   deficit   throughout   the    forecast  period  to  2.8%  of  GDP  in  2006.  Indeed,   while  export  growth is foreseen  to  accelerate  to  2.6%  in  2005  and  to  3.1%   in  2006,  imports  are   expected  to  rise  by  1.8%  and  2%  in  2005  and  2006,   respectively.  The  volatility  a nd  magnitude  of  the  off- shore  banking  operations  makes  it  difficult  to  project   future  developments  of  the  financial  account.  Indeed,   EU  funds  will  limit  the  deterioration  of  the  external   position of Malta.   Public Finances  The  general  government  deficit 2  is foreseen to fall  from 9.6% of GDP in 2003 to 5.1% of GDP in 2004.  It ill follow a downward path and reach 4% of GDP in  2005 and 3.3% of GDP in 2 006. Gross public debt is  expected  to  increase  from  70.3%  of   GDP  in  2003,  to   74.2%    of    GDP    in    2006.     Since    the    Maltese         2  The shipyards restructuring in 2003 implied one-off increase in  the general government deficit of 3.2% of GDP  government  will  present  th e  2005  draft  budget  only   by the last week of November, these forecast does not  take  into  account  a  number  of  measures,  which  are   not  mentioned  in  the  conv ergence  programme  (CP)   with  sufficient  detail  and  affect  current  revenues  and   expenditures.  However,  the   projections  presented  in   the  CP  for  capital  transfers  and  public  gross  fixed   capital formation in the CP ha ve been included in the  forecasts  since  they  referred  either  to  funds  received   from  the  EU  and  from  the  Italian  government  or  to   expenditures    linked    such    funds    or    to    other     multiannnual plan		
November/2004	Netherlands	Emerging gradually 	The situation in 2004   According  to  the  most  recent  data,  real  GDP  fell  by   0.9%  in  2003,  the  first   time  that  overall  economic   activity  contracted  since  1982.  However,  economic   activity recovered in the second half of the year. This  recovery  continued  into   2004  and  available  data  and   indicators show a steady, albeit gradual, improvement  in  underlying  economic  conditions.  Increasingly,  the   Dutch economy benefited from booming international  trade.  At  the  same  time,  domestic  demand  remained   lacklustre,  as  private  consumption  was  held  back  by   weak    household    disposable    income    and    low     confidence,    fiscal    policy    was    tightened,    and     investment  adjusted  to   low  profitability  during  the   downturn. The labour market deteriorated in a lagged  response   to   the   downtur n,   but   the   decline   in    employment   was   more   moderate   in   the   second    quarter,   while   over   the   summer   the   seasonally    adjusted    unemployment    r ate    even    fell    slightly.     Consumer  price  inflation  decreased  markedly  in  the   first  nine    months  of  the  year,  to  1.0%  in  September,   the   lowest   rate   since   June   1989,   reflecting   weak    economic activity, low import prices, and the effect of  the  agreement  among  social  partners  to  moderate   wage increases.  Sluggish recovery in domestic demand  Economic  activity  is  forecast  to  further  improve  over   the   projection   period,   albe it   only   gradually.   This    mainly  reflects  the  sluggi sh  performance  of  domestic   demand,  primarily  private  consumption.  A  recovery   in  private  consumption  appears  to  be  held  back  not   only  by  weak  disposable   income,  but  also  by  low   confidence  among  consumers.  This  seems  to  reflect   inter     alia     the     uncertainty     among     consumers      concerning  the  consequences  of  the  restructuring  of   the  social  security  and  pension  systems,  as  well  as   increasing   tensions   between   the   government   and    social  partners.  In  2005,  private  consumption  growth   is expected to reach 0.9%, compared to 0.5% in 2004.  Consumption  is  expected  to  grow  modestly  in  2005,   in  spite  of  weak  real  dispos able  income  (due  to  the   moderate  rise  in  compensation,  further  increases  in   pension  premiums,  the  impact  of  higher  oil  prices,   and  fiscal  tightening)  as   the  household  savings  ratio   decreases somewhat. Privat e consumption growth will  be  barely  more  than  1%  in  2006,  but  this  is  largely   due  to  the  mechanical  impact  of  the  reform  in  the   healthcare  system  that  will  take  place  in  that  year. 3 The  reform  should  imply   a  shift  in  the  recorded   expenditure   from   private   consumption   to   public    expenditure   on   health   care.   While   fiscal   restraint    should hold back government consumption and public  investment,    private    investment    is    expected    to     accelerate    in    response    to    an    improvement    in     profitability  and  improving   demand  conditions.  The   relatively  low  capacity  utili sation  in  the  near  term   would,  however,  militate  against   a  sharp  rise  in  the   investment ratio. In contrast  to the relatively sluggish  recovery  in  domestic  demand,  the  contribution  from   net    exports    should    remain    buoyant,    as    Dutch     exporters  benefit  from  the  strength  of  world  demand   and an improvement in comp etitiveness. Despite high  oil  prices,  inflation  should   remain  relatively  subdued   and  pick  up  only  slightly   in  2006.  Th is  relatively   benign  inflation  development  results  from  the  impact   of  moderate  wage  increases,  a  cyclical  pick-up  in   productivity  growth,  and  weak  import  prices.  The   labour  market  will  still  deter iorate  in  2005,  with  the   unemployment  rate  peaking  at  5.0%.  However,  as   employment  growth  is  expected  to  reach  1.2%  in   2006, unemployment is forecast  to fall slightly in that  year. Deficit to fall in response to economic recovery and  fiscal tightening  Annual    national    accounts    confirmed    a    general     government  deficit  of  3.2%  of  GDP  in  2003,  an   increase  of  1.3%  of  GDP  compared  to  the  previous   year.   This   marked   deterioration   occurred   despite    substantial fiscal tightening. It  shows the sensitivity of  Duch  public  finances  to  the  deep  and  protracted   economic     slowdown.     However,     other     factors,      including  the  rise  in  tax-exempt  pension  premiums,   tax-deductible  interest  paymen ts  on  mortgages,  and  a   larger-than-expected  rise  in  the  deficit  of  the  sub- sector  local  government  also  played  a  role  in  the   widening   of   the   deficit.   In   order   to   stem   the    worsening   of   the   public    accounts,   the   authorities    implemented   a   supplementary   package   of   savings    equivalent to 0.6% of GDP in  April 2004; around half  of  these  measures  were  of  a  one-off  nature.  As  a   consequence,   the   general   government   deficit   is    expected to fall to  2.9% of GDP in 2004.  The  2005  budget  contains  consolidation  measures   equivalent  to  around  half  a  percentage  point  of  GDP.   The  deficit-reducing  measures  in  the  2005  budget   comprise  cuts  in  health  expenditures,  increases  in   income  tax  rates,  reduced  access  to  unemployment   benefits,  higher  disability  premiums,  and  the  phasing   out  of  subsidies  on  low-paid  labour.  For  a  large  part,   the  savings  in  2005  reflect  the  structural  impact  of   measures that were part of the April 2004 adjustment  package.  The  main  additi onal  savings  in  the  2005   budget  are  an  increase  in  the  rate  for  the  first  two   income  tax  brackets  and  further  cuts  in  net  spending   of  ministries.  In  2006,  an  end  to  fiscal  facilities  for   early retirement should also help improve the general  government  balance.  In  the  wake  of  fiscal  tightening   and  a  recovery  in  revenues  in  line  with  the  expected   economic  recovery,  the  deficit  is  expected  to  fall  to   2.4% of GDP in 2005 and 2.1% of GDP in 2006. By  contrast,   the   government   debt   to   GDP   ratio   is    projected   to   rise   over   the   forecast   horizon   as   a    consequence  of  the  rather  modest  pick-up  in  nominal   GDP  and  the  persistence  of  a  headline  deficit.  The   debt ratio is expected to increase from 54.1% in 2003  to 58.4% in 2005.  		
November/2004	Austria	Cyclical upswing, but government deficit rising	Developments in 2004  Real  GDP  is  expected  to  grow   in  line  with  potential   growth  by  1.9%  in  2004,  following  the  modest  0.8%   increase in 2003. Correspond ing to the typical pattern  of  economic  recovery  in  Austria,  export  demand  will   provide the initial impulse to stronger activity, before  investment and finally private consumption follow.  However,  the  composition  of  GDP  in  2003  and  2004   looks  unusual  (see  graph  belo w).  This  is  due  to  the   private  sector  response  to  an  investment  subsidy  that   was paid for any additional investment exceeding the  average  of  the  last  three  y ears.  Initially  limited  to   2003 only, this policy measur e resulted in a good deal  of investment being carried  forward in expectation of  the recovery. This accounts for the strong contribution  of   domestic   demand   to   GDP   growth   in   2003    (rendering  the  contribution  of  external  demand  even   negative),  but  also  for  the  dip  in  investment  in  2004,   even  though  the  subsidy  was  eventually  extended  to   2004.  On  average  over  2003  and  2004,  investment   grew according to the cyclical pattern of the economy.  Prospects for 2005 and 2006   Despite      government      cons umption      remaining       moderate,  domestic  demand  is  expected  to  contribute   more   strongly   to   real   GDP   growth,   projected   to    accelerate  until  2006.  The  income  tax  cuts  taking   effect    in    2005    will    gradually    support    private     consumption.  Also,  strengthening  demand  for  labour   and   higher   nominal   wages   per   capita   will   boost    disposable  income.  However,  higher  energy  costs  are   eroding     households’     real     purchasing     power.      Moreover,  private  confidence  may  be  undermined  by   the  fact  that  the  tax  cuts  are  leading  to  a  wider   government  deficit  than  originally  announced.  Thus,   the household saving ratio is projected to change little  over the forecast period.  After  the  policy-induced  dip,  investment  is  expected   to  return  to  healthy  growth  rates,  underpinned  by   rising  export  earnings  and  the  cuts  in  income  and   corporate  taxes.  However,  construction  investment   may  post  only  moderate  gains,  in  view  of  slack   demand  for  new  homes  and  the  persistent  excess   capacity  of  office  space.  In  line  with  the  assumption   of  a  gradually  slowing  wo rld  economy  and  firming   domestic  demand,  the  contribution  of  net  exports  to   GDP  is  expected  to  be  pos itive  but  diminishing  over   the projection period.   Labour market, costs and prices   After  a  slight  decline  in  the  previous  year,  total   employment   will   pick   up   s lightly   in   2004   and    continue  rising  up  to  the  forecast  horizon.  With  an   elastic  labour  supply,  unemployment  is  expected  to   fall  only  by  a  little  in  200 5.  The  secular  fall  in  self- employment,     in     particular     in     agriculture,     is      continuing.   Consumer  price  inflation  in   2004  is  expected  to  rise   considerably  from  last  year,  to  a  projected  rate  of   2.2%,  the  main  cause  being  oil  prices,  but  also  an   increase in energy taxes and excise duties on tobacco.  Towards  the  end  of  the  forecast  period,  inflation   should     subside     somewhat,     with     no     further      consumption  tax  increases  planned  and  the  oil  price   hike  withering.  Tariff  wages  are  expected  to  mirror   the  cyclical  upswing;  however,  the  wage  drift  is  not   expected to accelerate.  Public finances   In  January  2004,  the  first  step  of  tax  reform  took   effect.   However,   implicit   shortfall   in   direct   tax    revenues was offset by rises  in energy taxes and social  contributions.   Furthermore ,   the   low   profit   by   the    central  bank  in  2003  (due  to  low  interest  rates  and  a   depreciating   US-dollar)   wi ll   dampen   government    revenue in 2004.   Government  expenditures  are  expected  to  grow  by   2.5%  in  2004,  even  though  collective  consumption   expenditure    is    almost    stagnating    due    to    wage     moderation  and  the  beneficial  effects  of  pension   reform on government expenditure. The budget deficit  is expected to widen slightly  to 1.3% of GDP in 2004,  as compared with a narrowing to 0.7% of GDP in the  last stability programme update.  In  2005,  a  tax  relief  equalling  1%  of  GDP  will  be   implemented.  Wage  and  income  taxes  as  well  as   enterprise  taxes  will  be  aff ected  to  a  similar  extent.   However,   as   private   consumption   is   projected   to    recover  only  gradually  from  its  meagre  growth  in   2003,  tax  revenues  in  2005  may  be  slightly  weaker   than  expected  by  the  government.  Expenditures  are   expected  to  rise  by  a  moderate  1.5%  in  2005.  The   government  deficit  is  projected  at  2%  of  GDP  in   2005.  Whereas  the  output  gap  is   closing  and  event  turning   positive  by  2006,  earlier  plans  of  an  early  return  to   budgetary  balance  have  been  at  least  postponed.  The   cyclically-adjusted  deficit  is  expected  to  jump  by   almost one percentage point to 1.9% of GDP in 2005,  but to drop slightly to 1.7% of GDP in 2006.  General  government  debt  will  thus  remain  above  the   reference   value   of   60%   of   GDP   throughout   the    forecast period and decline in 2005 and 2006. 		
November/2004	Poland	Growing investment and improving fiscal outlook 	Economic situation in 2004  After two years of slow growth in 2001 and 2002, the  Polish  economy  is  experiencing  a  strong  recovery.   The upswing gradually  gained strength in 2003 and in  early  2004,  with  real  GDP  growth  accelerating  to   6.5% year-on-year in the first half of 2004 from 4.7%  in  the  last  quarter  of   2003  and  3.8%  in  2003  as  a   whole.   Growth   has   become   more   balanced,   with    domestic   demand   gradually   taking   over   from   net    exports   as   the   main   c ontributor   to   growth.   The    expansion   has   been   underpinned   by   supportive    monetary   conditions   reinforced   by   a   considerable    loosening  of  fiscal  policy  this  year.  Moreover,  the   rapid  growth  of  domestic  demand  in  the  first  half  of   the year reflected a transitory pre-EU entry economic  boom.  As  a  result,  activity  is  set  to  moderate  in  the   coming quarters, and real GDP growth is projected to  average 5.8% in 2004 as a whole.  Prospects in 2005 and 2006  With the withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus,  growth  is  expected  to  decelerate  over  the  next  two   years.   In   particular,   the   forecast   incorporates   the    recent  interest  rate  hikes  decided  by  t he  National   Bank  of  Poland  in  response  to  the  acceleration  in   inflation.     Given     also     the     expected     moderate      appreciation  of  the  zloty  against  the  euro,  monetary   conditions  are  set  to  be  les s  supportive  in  the  short   term,   while   the   long-delayed   fiscal   adjustment   is    projected to start in 2005. Overall, real GDP growth is  projected  to  ease  to  4.9%  in   2005  and  4.5%  in  2006.   Growth  will  be  driven  by  domestic  demand,  with   rising  private  consumption  and  a  gradual  rebound  in   investment  spending,  while   the  contribution  of  net   exports   is   expected   to   turn   negative   from   2005    onwards.  GDP components  After falling for 10 consecuti ve quarters by over 15%  in  total,  investment  activity   has  started  to  recover   timidly   since   the   third    quarter   of   2003.   Fixed    investment  remained  weak  in   the  first  half  of  this   year,  rising  by  only  3.4%  year-on-year.  Investment   growth  is  projected  to  accelerate  gradually  in  the   remainder  of  2004  and  in  the  next  two  years,  against   the backdrop of emerging capacity constraints, strong  corporate  profitability  a nd  accession-related  business   opportunities.  By  2006,  investment  should  replace   exports  as  the  most  dynamic  element  of  aggregate   demand.   Private  consumption  has  been   surprisingly  resilient   this  year  despite  high  unemployment  and  weak  real   income  growth,  partly  reflecting  a  spending  boom   triggered  by  fears  of  price  increases  after  accession.   Consumer  demand  is  likely  to  strengthen  over  the   forecast   period,   owing   to   improving   employment    prospects,   faster   real   wage   growth   and   growing    consumer  confidence.  Payments  to  farmers  linked  to   the   Common   Agricultural    Policy   will   provide   a    further boost.   Despite  the  loss  in  price   competitiveness entailed by  the   appreciation   of   the   zloty,   export   growth   is    expected  to  remain  robust,  boosted  by  productivity   gains  of  Polish  firms.  Poland  will  continue  to  gain   exports  market  shares  thr oughout  the  forecast  period.   However,  given  the  high  import  content  of Polish   exports   and   the   expected   recovery   of   investment    activity,  import  growth  is  also  projected  to  pick  up   strongly and should outpace export growth from 2005  onwards.  The  risks  to  the  growth  outlook  are  skewed  to  the   downside.  Persistent  fiscal  and  political  uncertainties   are  a  major  source  of  concern  for  the  strength  of  the   expected   investment   r ecovery.   The   behaviour   of    private  consumption  is  also  uncertain.  In  the  near   term,  the  more  restrictive  policy  stance  could  hold   back  household  spending.  Nevertheless,  once  fiscal   uncertainties    are    removed,    improved    consumer     confidence  could  lead  to  faster-than-expected  private   consumption growth.  Labour market, costs and prices  Unemployment  peaked  in  2002  at  some  20%  of  the   labour  force  and  since  then,  it  has  started  to  decrease   slowly. It is projected to st ay virtually unchanged this  year  despite  stronger  grow th.  The  persistence  of  job   losses well into the recovery reflects substantial gains  in labour productivity.  There is also a large structural  component    in    Poland’s    unemployment.    Labour     market    difficulties    are    further    exacerbated    by     unfavourable demographic dynamics and the ongoing  restructuring    process    in     heavy    industries    and     agriculture, which will entail sizeable job losses in the  coming  years.  Employment  growth  is  expected  to   resume   in   2005,   but   in    light   of   the   deep-seated    problems  in  the  labour  mark et,  it  is  unlikely  to  be   sufficiently strong for unem ployment to drop rapidly.  Overall, the unemployment r ate is projected to fall to  18.1% in 2006 from 19.2% in 2003.  Inflation  has  been  accelerating  sharply  since  April   2004,  with  HICP  inflation  overshooting  the  upper   limit  of  the  central  bank’s   target  band  from  June   onwards.  Core  inflation  an d  inflation  expectations   have  also  picked  up  signif icantly.  In  order  to  contain   second-round  effects,  the  central  bank  raised  its  key   reference  rate  by  a  cumulative  125  basis  points  to   6.5%  between  June  and  August.  The  acceleration  in   headline inflation can be attributed to rising food and  oil  prices  as  well  as  accession-related  increases  in   indirect taxes and, to a lesse r extent, to the closing of  the   output   gap.   HICP   inflation   is   expected   to    decelerate somewhat in the coming months and would  average  3.5%  in  2004,  up  from  the  very  low  level  of   0.7% in 2003.   With the output gap expecte d to turn pos itive in 2005,  higher  oil  prices  and  increasing  unit  labour  costs,   inflationary     pressures     are     likely     to     persist.      Nevertheless, this should no t lead to a renewed rise in  headline       inflation.       Th anks       to       favourable        developments    in    food    prices    and    a    restrictive     monetary policy, consumer price inflation is projected  to drop progressively to 3. 0% on average in 2006.  Unit  labour  cost  growth  is  projected  to  fall  by  1.3%   this  year,  owing  to  a  cyc lical  pick-up  in   productivity   to  6%  and  modest  compensation  growth.  But  labour   cost  growth  is  likely  to  increase  over  the  next  two   years, as nominal compensation growth is expected to  accelerate  somewhat  in  2005  and  2006  to  offset  this   year’s  very  weak  real  wage  growth.  Nevertheless,   high unemployment should limit wage pressures.   External accounts  Despite the deterioration in the terms of trade, the still  robust   export   performance   will   result   in   a   slight    reduction  in  the  trade  deficit  to  2.6%  of  GDP  this   year.  But  growing  imports  in  line  with  strengthening   domestic demand will lead to a steady widening of the  trade  deficit  over  the  next  two  years.  Over  the  2004- 2006  forecast  period,  higher  transfers  from  the  EU   will  have  a  positive  impact   on  both  the  current  and   capital   accounts.   The   current   account   deficit   is    projected  to  gradually  increase  to  3.3%  in  2006  from   2.2%  in  2003,    thus  remaining  at  a  level  that  can  be   easily   covered   by   foreign   direct   investment   and    portfolio inflows.  Public finances   At  5.6%  of  GDP,  the  general  government  deficit  in   2004 is estimated to be sli ghtly lower than expected in  the  previous  Commission  forecast.  The  downward   revision  of  the  deficit  results  from  a  better  than   expected  performance  of  the  Polish  economy  that   translated into higher revenues.  However,  despite  the  fa vourable  cyclical  situation,   and  a  downward  revision  of  the  deficit  for  2003,  the   deterioration   of   the   general   government   deficit    between 2003 and 2004 still  represents 1.7 percentage  points  and  reflects  a  substantial  loosening  of  fiscal   policy.   The  projections  for  the  def icit  in  2005  and  in  2006   have  been  revised  downwards  respectively  to  4.1%   and   3.1%   of   GDP   resulting   mainly   from   better    cyclical conditions. The expected rebound in domestic  demand  would  contribute  to  increased  tax  revenues.   Additional measures contained in the draft budget for  2005 have been incorporated in the forecast, provided  that  they  have  already  been  adopted  or  are  being  in   the final stage of discussion in Parliament, and would  further  retrench  expenditures  and  increase  revenues   over   2005   and   2006.   These   measures   include   in    particular  a  change  in  pension  indexation  rules  and  a   reform   of   defence   spending.   They   would   have   a    deficit-reducing  impact  of   around  1  percentage  point   of  GDP  in  2005.  A  positive  role  will  also  be  played   by the net inflows of fu nds from the EU budget.  The  primary  balance  is  expected  to  improve  after  a   considerable  deterioration  in  2004.  The  forecast  still   includes the surplus of the open pension funds, which  is  expected  to  reach  appr oximately  1.6%  of  GDP  in   2004, within the general government sector.  As   the   borrowing   needs   of   the   government   are    expected to decrease, the gr oss debt figures have been  revised  downwards.  The  improvement  results  also   from  better  than  previously  expected  privatization   prospects.  From  47.7%  of  GDP  in  2004,  the  debt-to- GDP  ratio  would  increase  to  50%  in  2005.  It  would   then slightly decrease to 49.3% by the end of 2006.  		
November/2004	Portugal	Coming out of the recession 	Overall developments and prospects  After the recession in 2003, when real GDP shrunk by  1.2%,  economic  activity  has  been  recovering,  with   solid  growth  in  the  first  ha lf  of  2004.  In  the  current   year,  internal  demand  has  been  leading  the  recovery,   with    gains    in    both    private    consumption    and     investment. GDP is expected  to grow by 1.2% in real  terms for the full year.  For  2005,  internal  demand  is  expected  to  remain   buoyant,  with  a  slightly   different  composition,  since   private consumption growth is expected to slow down  already   in   the   course   of   the   current   year,   while    investment    should    recover    strongly    from    the     retrenchment of 2002 and 2003.   Growth of Portuguese exports has been lively in 2004,  but  a  slightly  lower  pace  is  foreseen  for  2005  and   2006.  This  is  due  to  the  demand  slowdown  expected   in  some  of  the  country’s  major  trading  partners  and   the lack of significant improve ment in real unit labour  costs  in  the  manufacturing  industry  relative  to  other   competitors.  With  respect  to  imports,  the  buoyant   domestic   demand   has   been   leading   to   a   strong    rebound of imported  goods in 2004.   The  combined  effect  of  the  projected  export  and   import  trends  is  a  deterioration  of  Portugal’s  external   balance   in   2004.   As   a   share   of   GDP,   the   net    borrowing  of  the  economy  is  expected  to  stabilize  in   2005 and 2006.  All in all, the main driving force of the economy over  the  forecast  period  is  likely  to  be  internal  demand,   while  the  external  sector  will  provide  only  a  minor   contribution  to  growth.  GDP  growth  is  forecast  at   2.2%  in  2005  and  to  slightly  accelerate  to  2.4%  in   2006.  Prices The  economic  downturn  in   2003  significantly  eased   pressure on prices and wages. Despite the recovery of  internal  demand,  the  persistence  of  a  negative  output   gap  is  expected  to  contain  inflation.  High  oil  prices,   also   in   2006,   coupled   with   increased   economic    activity,    could,    however,    prevent    the    projected     deceleration. Labour Market  Unemployment  has  been  on  an  ascending  path  since   2000. The cyclical developments, which led to a sharp  rise  in  unemployment  in  2003,  are  now  expected  to   prevent  a  further  deterioration  on  the  labour  market.   In  2004,  the  unemployment  ra te  is  forecast  to  stay   flat.  Only  marginal  reduc tions  are  foreseen  in  2005   and 2006.   Public Finances  In  2003,  the  government  deficit  stood  at  2.8%  of   GDP.  Since  the  economic  recession  severely  hurt   current  tax  revenues,  the  broadly  stable  deficit  figure   was  achieved  through  two  one-off  operations  worth   together over 2% of GDP.   In  2004,  after  taking  into   account  the  effects  of  the   sale of tax arrears in the previous year, fiscal revenues  have  been  growing  above  expectations,  which  can  be   partially     ascribed     to     a     stronger-than-expected      recovery     of     internal     demand.     Even     though      developments  on  the  revenue  side  will  facilitate  a   reduction   of   the   deficit,   the   expansion   of   public    expenditures,  both  in  real  and  nominal  terms,  will   hamper   further   budgetary    consolidation   in   2004.    Without  further  measures,  a  deficit  clearly  in  excess   of 3% of GDP would ensue. In order to bring it below  that  figure,  the  Portugues e  government  is  planning   one-off  operations:  (i)  the  sale  of  real  estate  assets,   currently   scrutinized   by   Eurostat,   shall   generate    revenues  worth  0.8%  of  GDP;  (ii)  the  transfer  to  the   state sector of pension liabilities for four state-owned  enterprises (SOE), with exp ected proceeds of 1.2% of  GDP.  These  operations  are  taken  on  board  in  the   current  forecast,  which  leads  to  an  expected  general   government deficit of 2.9% of GDP.  The  cyclical  upturn  projected  for  the  next  two  years   should  facilitate  budgetary  co nsolidation.  However,   under  the  assumption  of  no-policy  change,  there  is  a   high  risk  that  the  pace  of  the  economic  recovery  per   se will not be enough to bring the general government  deficit  below  the  reference  value  of  3%  of  GDP.  It   shall be noted that as from 2005, the reduction of the  corporate  tax  rate,  from  30  to  25%,  will  have  its  full   effect on the revenue side. All in all, the revenue and  expenditure  trends  will  lead  to  government  deficits   that,  with  high  likelihood,  will  be  in  excess  of  3%  of   GDP   over   the   forecast   period.   For   2005,   the    Portuguese  authorities  are  envisaging  two  revenue- raising  measures:  (i)  receiving  a  one-off  payment  of   dividends,  worth  0.5%  of  GDP,  from  a  SOE,  an   operation  that  is  being  ex amined  by  Eurostat;  (ii)  a   lump-sum  payment  to  the  state  sector,  equal  to  0.3%   of  GDP,  in  exchange  of  the  responsibility  for  taking   over  pension  liabilities  of  a  SOE.  After  incorporating   these   two   measures   in   the   current   forecast,   and    pending  a  final  Eurostat   decision,  the  government   deficit for 2005 would come close to 3.7% of GDP. In  2006,  the  deficit  may  go  to  3.8%,  assuming  that  all   one-off measures are phased-out.   The     Portuguese     government     has     stated     its      commitment  to  keep  the  deficit  at  or  below  3%  of   GDP  also  in  2005.  To  this   end,  the  government  is   envisaging      further      revenue-raising      transitory       measures.  Since  some  of  these  measures  have  not   been  announced  to  a  degree  of  precision  that  would   allow   their   appropriate   assessment,   they   are   not    included in the current forecast.		
November/2004	Slovenia	Economy in a rebound	Recent developments and prospects for 2004    In  2003,  Slovenia’s  real  GDP  growth  decelerated  to   2.5%,    the    lowest    rate    since    1993,    against    a     persistently      bleak      international      environment.       Economic  performance  has  faltered  as  export  growth   slowed   to   3.2%   while   imports   rose   by   6.8%.    Consequently,  the  foreign  demand  contribution  to   GDP  growth  turned  negative.  In  2003,  the  push  was   mainly internal. Investment expenditure was booming  at  10.5%  and  private  spending  rebounded  to  2.7%,   largely  fuelled  by  high  credit  growth  as  real  wages   increased only moderately and employment fell again.  The  acceleration  in  government  consumption  having   risen   by   2.6%   provided   further   stimulus   to   a    continuous  strengthening  of  domestic  demand.  With   export  activity  improving  steadily  in  relation  to  a   gradual recovery in the EU,  growth started to pick-up  towards the end of 2003.    This  year,  the  economy  appears  to  have  caught  a   strong   growth   momentum,   supported   by   export    expansion,  prolonged  invest ment  surge,  significant   stock-building  and  marked  household  consumption.   The  upward  trend  in  the  quarterly  dynamics  of  GDP   components   upholds   the   an ticipation   of   a   robust    economic upturn, albeit much of the recent rise seems  to  have  come  from  a  considerable  building  up  of   inventories.  In  the  first  half  of  2004  the  economy   grew by 4.2% compared to th e same period last year,  but  is  expected  to  slow   down  somewhat  in  the  last   two quarters, to reach 4.0% over the year as a whole.  Outlook for 2005-2006   For  2005,  the  forecast  projects  GDP  growth  to  stay   steady  at  3.6%  as  the  economy  comes  under  a  mild   temporary  strain  of  presently  high  commodity  price   levels,  confirmed  by  wither ing  investors’  confidence.   It is especially domestic consumption that is likely to  drive the economy next year. Real wage increases are  expected to be subdued, however, a gentle pick-up in  employment  and  a  new  personal  income  tax  regime   should spur household spending.  In  2006,  when  the  negative  effects  of  high  oil  prices   are  expected  to  gradually  fade,  growth  should  start   accelerating  again.  All  components  should  contribute   to  GDP  growth,  forecast  at  3.8%,  with  domestic   demand  giving  the  main  impetus.  Underlying  the   modest    upturn    is    the    anticipation    of    buoyant     consumption  and  investment  against  the  background   of  vigorous  construction   activity,  production  capacity   adjustments     to     enhance     competitiveness     and      increasing exports. In step with strengthened domestic  demand  and  exports,  imports  are  also  set  to  rise   slightly.  With  a  slowdown  in  the  EU  economy  impinging  on   Slovenia’s   exports,   the   current   account   surplus    narrowed,   moving   closer    to   balance   in   2003.   A    marginally  negative  current  account  is  expected  to   deteriorate moderately in 2005 and 2006.    Labour market, wages and prices  In    2003,    employment    fell    and    unemployment     increased.  This  year  the  unemployment  rate  is  to   return  to  past  levels  of   slightly  above  6%  and  then   resume its gradual trend decline as GDP growth stays  resilient.   In  May  2004,  a  new  wage  agreement  for  the  private   sector  was  adopted,  stipulating  that  pay  should  lag   behind productivity growth by at least one percentage  point.   Furthermore,   it   introduced   forward-looking    indexation,   which   takes   in to   account   anticipated    rather     than     actual     domestic     consumer     price      movements,  inflationary  expectations  in  the  EU  and   the    euro/tolar    exchange    rate.    The    indexation     mechanism is similar to the  one agreed for the public  sector  in  July  2003  and  is  considered  benign  to  the   disinflationary process.  Consumer  price  inflation  has  decreased  impressively,   dropping from 8.6% in 2001 to 5.7% in 2003 after the  economic   slowdown   has   eased   the   inflationary    pressures.  Inflation  continued  to  decline  rapidly  in   2004;  in  September,  the  12-month  moving  average   rate  of  consumer  price  growth  stood  at  4.0%.  The   government     exercised     prudence     in     regulating      administered price increases and indirect tax changes,  as  well  as  applied  frequent  adjustments  of  excise   duties  on  oil  to  temper  the  impact  of  world  market   price  fluctuations.  Moreov er,  the  Bank  of  Slovenia   has  geared  its  monetary  po licy  towards  slowing  the   depreciation of the currency  until entering ERM II on  28 June when the tolar was fixed at 239.64 tolars per  1 euro within a +/- 15% fluctuation band. Ever since,  the  exchange  rate  has  remained  close  to  the  central   parity.  Assuming  anti-inflationary  policies  continue,   while  exchange  rate  stab ility  now  credibly  anchors   expectations, inflation is projected to stay on a steady  trend decline. Public finance  A  revision  of  the  government  accounts,  linked  to  the   sectoral  re-classification  of  some  public  institutions,   has  raised  the  general  government  deficit  figures  for   the  period  2000-20 03  (by  0.2-0.5%  of   GDP).  Within   the  new  methodological  framework,  the  projection   foresees  the  deficit  this  year  to  worsen,  arriving  at   2.3%  of  GDP,  mostly  as   a  result  of  subdued  VAT   revenue  following  the  tax  collection  change  after  EU   accession.  The  deficit  is  projected  to  remain  broadly   stable,  declining  marginally  to  2.2%  of  GDP  next   year,  as  the  decline  in  revenues  due  to  the  direct  tax   reform  effective  from  January  2005  is  compensated   by  an  inflow  of  EU  funds.  Expenditure  limits  and   changes  of  the  indexation  sy stem,  containing  the  rise   of public sector wages and certain social transfers, are  expected  to  help  bring  the   deficit  down  to  1.9%  of   GDP in 2006. 		
November/2004	Slovakia	Domestic demand picks up	Growth in 2003 and in the first half of 2004   In  2003,  real  GDP  growth  slightly  decelerated  to  4%   and  its  composition  turned  around.  Stellar  export   growth  of  almost  23%  in   real  terms  propelled  the   external  growth  contribution  to  6½  percentage  points   – in spite of the lacklust re performance of Slovakia’s  main     export     markets.     The     domestic     growth      contribution  became  negativ e.  Private  consumption   expenditure was dampened significantly by real wage  developments,  resumed  adjustments  in  administered   prices and indirect taxes, and the implementation and  anticipation   of   reforms   in    the   social   and   health    systems.  Gross  fixed  capital  formation  contracted  as   well. The  first  half  of  2004  witnessed  a  reversal  of  these   trends, which had already star ted in the fourth quarter  of 2003, and the growth contributions of all domestic  demand components entered into positive territory. In  particular,  private  consumption  picked  up  faster  than   had been commonly expected. This was partly due to  a    shift    of    some    components    of    employees’     compensation from end-2003 to 2004 as a reaction to  the  introduction  of  lower  in come  taxes  (flat  rate  of   19%). Export growth fell but remained robust at 16%,  ensuring  a  continued  pos itive  external  contribution.   Altogether,  GDP  growth  for  the  first  half  of  2004   reached almost 5½% (y-o-y).  Growth prospects   The immediate outlook for th e Slovak economy is for  a  continuation  of  strong  grow th  for  the  rest  of  2004,   leading to almost 5% growth for the year as a whole.   -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 01 02 03 04 05 06 Domestic (excl. Inventories) Inventories External Total growth  Forecast Graph 3.27: Slovakia - GDP  g rowth  an d i ts con tri bu tors  Private  consumption  is  expected  to  stay  strong  as  the   increase  of  disposable  income  accelerates,  with  the   income   tax   cuts   outweighing    restraints   on   social       transfers and with real wage growth increasing. Gross  fixed  capital  formation  is  likely  to  expand  sharply  as   business  environment  and  confidence  have  further   strengthened  and  as  the  first  tranches  of  pledged   greenfield     investments,      predominantly     in     the      automobile   sector,   are   being   implemented.   The    external      growth      contribution      will      weaken       considerably but is exp ected to remain positive.  In  2005,  domestic  demand  growth  is  set  to  pick  up   further     as     private     consumption     expands     in      synchronization   with   higher   real   wages,   a   falling    household  savings  rate  an d  strong  household  credit   growth  and  as  FDI-induced   gross  capital  formation   peaks.    The    associated    increase    in    imports    of     investment goods will contri bute to a slightly negative  external   influence   on    GDP   growth.   The   latter   is    expected to settle at around 4½%.   In 2006, new export capacity  will come on stream and  the   external   growth   contribution   should   become    positive    again.    Moreover,    domestic    demand    is     expected   to   remain   strong,   although   gross   fixed    capital    formation    is    predicted    to    slow    down.     Altogether, GDP growth is predicted at a rate of more  than 5%.   Inflation Consumer  price  headline  inflation  has  been  hovering   around  8%  in  2003  and  200 4,  while  core  inflation   stayed  below  or  around  3%.  This  discrepancy  has   been    due    to    still    significant    adjustments    in     administered  prices  and  indirect  taxes.  As  of  2005,   such measures exert much less influence and there are  reasonable   prospects   that    headline   inflation   will    rapidly  fall  to  levels  around  4%  in  2005  and  3%  in   2006  –  assuming  that  potenti al  second-round  effects,   including  due  to  any  back ward-looking  wage  setting,   are kept in check.  Current account  The  current  account  deficit  narrowed  dramatically   from  around  8%  of  GDP  in  2002  to  roughly  1%  of   GDP   in   2003,   mirroring   the   impressive   export    performance  of  that  year.  Over  the  forecast  horizon   the  deficit  is  expected  to  sl ightly  widen  but  to  stay   around 3% of GDP, with the trade balance remaining  the main determinant.   Labour market  After  a  strong  performance  in  2003,  employment   expansion  seems  to  have  come  to  a  halt  in  2004  as   economic   restructuring   continues.   Employment   is    predicted  to  expand  again  in  2005  and  2006.  Partly   reflecting     unemployment     benefit     reforms,     the      unemployment  rate  fell  strongly   in  2003  but  is  likely   to  rise  again  in  2004.  A  gradual  reduction  is  likely   over the rest of the forecast horizon.       Public finances  With a general government deficit of 3.7% of GDP in  2003,   the   Slovak   authorities   substantially   over-    performed on their original target of 5% of GDP.  The  implementation  of  the  budget  2004  reflects  most   of  the  government’s  structur al  reform  agenda  for  the   current  legislative  period,  bo th  on  the  revenue  and   expenditure     side.     This     includes     notably     the      introduction of a flat tax rate  of 19% not only for the  individual  but  also  the  corporate  income  tax,  of  a   uniform   19%   VAT   rate,   and   of   comprehensive    reforms in the social sphere. So far, budget execution  seems to be well on track an d the government is likely  to  reach  its  target  of  a  deficit  slightly  below  4%  of   GDP.   For the years 2005 and 2 006, the general government  deficit  is  expected  to  stay   basically  flat  –  roughly  in   line  with  the  government ’s  objectives.  The  predicted   deficit  figures  include  the  revenue-decreasing  effects   of  the  introduction  of  a  mandatory  funded  pension   pillar at the beginning of 20 05, which are estimated at  almost  ½  of  a  percentage  point  of  GDP  in  the  first   year and nearly 1 percentage point of GDP in 2006. 		
November/2004	Finland	Growth set to maintain strong momentum, increasingly supported by  exports	Economic developments in 2004   Following   real   GDP   grow th   of   2.0%   in   2003,    economic   activity   expanded   more   strongly   than    anticipated, growing by 3.0% year-on-year in the first  half  of  2004.  According  to   revised  data,  output  grew   by 1.1% in the first quarter from the previous period,  owing    mainly    to    continued    strong    household     consumption and exports bei ng boosted by cruise ship  deliveries.  In  the  second   quarter,  real  GDP  growth   decelerated    to    0.7%,    even    though    investment     increased  strongly,  with  equipment  investment  up  by   4.9% on the quarter, as pr ivate consumption remained  flat  and  exports   plunged  by  5.1%  from  the  previous   quarter. Overall, it appears that domestic demand has  propelled  growth  in  the  firs t  part  of  2004,  while  the   contribution  from  the  extern al  side  has  been  more   subdued  than  expected.  Household  consumption  was   fuelled  by  earnings,  direct  and  indirect  tax  cuts,  and   low   interest   rates,   while    public   consumption   has    expanded  only  modestly,   in  line  with  expectations.     Total   investment   has   grown   since   summer   2003,    confirming  that  a  cyclical  turnaround  has  taken  hold.   Residential  construction  and  equipment  investment   have increased strongly, more than offsetting a further  slump  in  commercial  building.   In  first  half  of  2004,   exports  were  boosted  by  cruise  ship  deliveries  and   strong demand for metal products, but overall exports  have  suffered  from  the  diff iculties  in  the  electronics   industry.  Imports  contracted  in  the  first  part  of  2004,   as  fewer  cars  were  imported   to  Finland  than  in  2003.   The weakening in the terms  of trade has continued as  export   prices   remained   broadly   flat   while   import    prices increased.    In  contrast  to  the  stronger  activity,  employment  has   declined  further,  by  0.4%  up  to  September  2004.   Nevertheless, unemployment remained broadly stable  as  labour  supply  contracted   as  well.  Inflation  (HICP)   declined from an average of 1.3% in 2003 to 0.2% in  September  2004  on  account  of  the  alcohol  tax  cut   taking effect in March. Prospects for 2005 and 2006   The  economy  is  projected  to   firmly  remain  on  the   growth path throughout the forecast period. Based on  survey  indicators,  exports  are  expected  to  pick  up   during the latter part of 2004, while domestic demand  will   remain   solid.   In    2005-06,   net   exports   will    increasingly contribute to growth, while support from  private  consumption  will  recede,  but  investment  is   expected to pick up the slack.  Consequently, activity  is  set  to  expand  at  a  steady  pace,  peaking  in  2005  at   3.1% and then easing to 2¾% in 2006.   Job  creation  is  expected  to  pick  up  slightly  as  from   2005,     allowing     some     modest     inroads     into      unemployment,  which  remains  largely  structural  in   nature.   GDP components   Private  consumption  is  expected  to  continue  driving   activity,  although  gains  in  disposable  income  will  be   lower   as   the   temporary   factors   that   supported    purchasing power in 2004  will fade away. In addition,  higher  inflation  and  increases  in  tax-like  charges  will   dampen  growth  in  real  disposable  income.  Public   consumption  is  expected  to  increase  modestly,  given   the  efforts  of  the  central  government  at  expenditure   control. Investment has finall y returned to the growth  trend  and,  given  the  projected   stronger  stimulus  from   external demand and improving capacity utilisation, is  projected to accelerate in 2005-2006.   Exports  are  anticipated  to  strengthen  on  the  back  of   the  stable  international  economic  outlook  and  to  gain   further  momentum  in  2006.  In  spite  of  the  recent   setbacks  in  the  electronics  industry,  the  prospects  for   exports   of   telecommunication   equipment   appear    rather  promising.  Also  the  outlook  for  forest  and   metal industry exports is positive.  Labour market, costs and prices  Alcohol  tax  cuts  of  33%  on  average  are  exerting   downward pressure of prices, bringing HICP inflation  to  about  ¼%  in   2004.  For  2005  and  2006,  inflation   may rise to about 1.5%, as the economy expands and  the  effect  of  the  tax  cut  fades  away.  The  centralised   two-year  wage  agreement  that  provides  for  general   wage  rises  of  2.2%  in  2004  will  expire  in  February   2005.  Even  though  the   outlook  for   new  collective   wage  agreement  seems  currently  rather  bleak,  the   baseline  assumption  of  the  forecast  is  that  wage  rises   will broadly follow the trend  observed in recent years.   Public finances   The general government surplu s is foreseen to remain  unchanged  from  2003  at  2.3%  of  GDP  in  2004.   Central  government  finances  are  expected  to  be  in   surplus,  although  they  have  been  weakening  for  four   consecutive  years,  while  municipalities  continue  to   stay  in  deficit.  Based  on  the  government’s  medium- term  spending  guidelines   of  Spring  2004  and  the   budget  proposal  for  2005,   the  general  government   surplus  is  estimated  to  s tay  over  2%  of  GDP  during   the  forecast  period.  Central  government  finances  are   projected  to  be  in  deficit   in  2005-06  as  expenditures   are  rising  at  a  faster  pace  than  revenues.  Moreover,   local  governments  may  stay  in  deficit,  even  if  the   financial  position  should  improve  due  to  higher  tax   receipts  and  moderate  expenditure  growth.  Overall,   the   general   government   surplus   will   be   largely    accounted for by the social security funds.  The  government  debt  ratio  is  anticipated  to  fall  from   44.8%  of  GDP  in  2004  to   about  42%  of  GDP  by  the   end of the forecast period. 		
November/2004	Sweden	The labour market revives in 2005 consolidating robust economic growth 	The situation in 2004   Swedish  economic  growth  ha s  been  strong  in  2004,   with GDP growth up by 3.7% on the year in the first  half; growth accelerated from 0.9% in the first quarter  to   1.0%   in   the   second.   Exports   have   expanded    substantially,    outpacing    imports,    resulting    in    a     considerable  growth  contri bution  from  net  exports.   On   the   domestic   side,   private   consumption   has    advanced    steadily    and    in    the    second    quarter     investment    expansion    was    encouraging    after    a     sustained   period   of   slu ggishness.   Relatively   poor    developments  observed  in  the  labour  market  have   helped  to  contain  wage  demands  and  inflationary   pressures  have  been  very   low.  The  subdued  outlook   for  inflation  has  enabled  the   Riksbank  to  extend  its   cycle  of  reducing  interest  rates,  with  further  cuts  in   the  repo-rate  of  75  basis  poin ts  in  the  first  half  of   2004.  Recent  indicators  are  positive,  with  both  consumers   and  business  expectations  at  relatively  high  levels.   The  consumer  confidence  indicator  has  continued  to   show    a    positive    picture.     Business    confidence     indicators  are  similarly  encouragin g.  The  industrial   confidence indicator has been rising since last autumn  and  stood  clearly  above  its  long-term  average  in   September.   The   purchasing   managers   index   also    signals expansion. These prospects are expected to be  confirmed in a steady continuation of the recovery in  the remainder of 2004, w ith GDP growth of 3.7%. In  particular  the  external  side  is  expected  to  contribute   very strongly to growth this year.  Disposable  income  growth  has  strengthened  in  2004   compared  with  2003,  providing  for  continued  steady   increase  in  private  consumption.  The  saving  rate  of   households, though remaining above 10%, is expected  to  be  lower  in  2004  co mpared  with  2003.  Financial   wealth   has   benefited   from   rising   equity   prices.    Moreover, while households have taken on more debt,  house    prices    have    continued    to    rise    steadily,     contributing  to  the  mainte nance  of  a  relatively  strong   net wealth position of households.  Prospects for 2005-06  A   resumption   of   employment   growth   contributes    positively  to  household  disposable  income  in  2005   and  more  significantly  so   in  2006.  An  additional   modest  reduction  of  the  saving  rate  is  expected  in   2005.   All   in   all,   this    should   result   in   stable    consumption  growth  in  the  years  to  2006.  Public   consumption  is  expected  to  continue  to  be  relatively   steady    over    the    forecast    period.    Turning    to     investment, the conditions for  a strong recovery are in  place: a benign demand outlook, favourable financing  conditions,  a  long   period  of  falling  total  investments   and  a  high  capacity  utilisation  rate  in  manufacturing.   A  strong  investment  expansion  should  therefore  take   place over the forecast period. Exports are expected to  continue  to  grow  relatively  strongly  up  to  2006,  in   line with world markets. Imports should expand more  rapidly as final demand strengthens further during the  forecast period. In 2005, economic growth is expected  to   be   3.1%,   above   the   po tential   rate,   driven   by    domestic  demand.  In  2006,  the  economy  is  expected   to  grow  almost  as  fast,  close  to  the  potential  rate.   With  a  relatively  strong  GD P  evolution  over  this   period, interest rates may rise slightly.   Labour market, costs and prices   Employment  growth  has  been  negative  in  2004  and   the  unemployment  rate  has  ri sen.  The  strong  rise  in   economic  activity  foreseen  from  2004  onwards  is   expected  to  result  in  an   improvement  in  the  labour   market in 2005 and in par ticular in 2006. Inflation has  fallen  considerably  since  electricity  and  energy  price   increases in late 2003, notwithstanding the significant  recent  rises  in  oil  prices.  Wages  are  expected  to  rise   relatively  moderately,  reflecting  past  weakness  in  the   labour  market.  The  wage  agreements  reached  in  the   spring of 2004 resulted in lower negotiated wage rises  in industry  compared with the 2001 wage negotiation   round. Against this backgrou nd, inflationary pressures  should  be  subdued  this  year.  As  demand  and  growth   revive further in 2005 and  2006, inflation is expected  to  rise  gradually  to  2%  during  the  course  of  2006.   With  relatively  strong  grow th  over  this  period,  and   with  an  improvement  in   the  labour  market  from  next   year, interest rates may start to rise.  Public finances   In  2004,  the  surplu s  in  public  finances  is  expected  to   rise  to  slightly  above  0.5%  of  GDP.  Income  tax  cuts   in  2005  proposed   in  the  Budget  Bill,  one  part  of  the   last step of a phased income tax reform, contributes to  keep  the  surplus  ratio  in  the  government  finances   unchanged  in  2005.  On  current  policies,  a  slight  rise   in  the  budget  balance  is  projected  in  2006,  compared   with   the   previous   year,   benefiting   also   from   an    improvement     in     the     labour     market.     General      government   debt,   which   mainly   lies   in   central    government, is projected to rise as central government  is  expected  to  remain  in  deficit  over  the  forecast   period.   The   increase   is   nevertheless   slower   than    nominal  GDP  over  the  forecast  period,  resulting  in  a   fall in the debt ratio to close  to 50% of GDP in 2006.  		
November/2004	United Kingdom	Growth moderating, but remaining strong 	The situation in 2004  Output  growth  in  the  UK  in  2004  has  been  robust.   Momentum  throughout  the  second  half  of  2003  has   been sustained, resulting in  a 3.6% expansion over the  year   to   the   second   qu arter   of   2004,   well   above    estimates of the trend rate of growth.   Domestic  demand  has  been  the  key  driver  of  this   performance.  Private  consumption  expenditure  has   again been a significant source of growth, along with  supportive  government  cons umption  –  the  latter  the   result   of   a   sustained   programme   of   government    spending   aimed   at   improv ing   public   services.   In    addition,  the  pickup  in  fi xed  investment  observed   during  the  second  half  of  2003  has  continued  apace   following  improvements  in  corporate  profitability.  A   sustained    appreciation    of    the    sterling    effective     exchange  rate,  through  the   second  half  of  2003  and   into  March  2004  appears  to  have  dampened  any   further stimulus from growth in export volumes, but a  more  recent,  smaller  depreciation  over  the  summer   may yet help the UK’s expo rt performance in the later  part   of   the   year,   particu larly   in   the   face   of   the    expected wider global recovery.   As  in  2003,  growth  has  been  strongest  in  the  service   and   construction   sectors.   After   four   consecutive    quarters   of   expansion,   manufacturing   output   fell    slightly  in  the  first  quarte r,  in  apparent  contradiction   with survey evidence repo rting an improving outlook.  In  the  second  quarter,  however,  quarter-on-quarter   growth  of  1.2%  in  manufacturing  output  once  again   suggested that recovery  was still in progress.  Unemployment  has  remained  at  record-low  levels,   falling  to  4.7%  in  September  2004.  Notwithstanding   the  strength  of  the  labour  market,  and  a  pickup  in   average     earnings,     inflationary     pressures     have      appeared   subdued,   with   the   harmonised   index   of    consumer prices (known in the UK as CPI) remaining  well  below  the  Bank  of  England’s  symmetric  2%   inflation   target   throughou t   the   year.   The   Bank’s    Monetary     Policy     Committee     (MPC)     has,     in      anticipation   of   emerging   price   pressures,   already    raised  its  policy  interest  rate  by  25bp  on  4  occasions   during  2004  –  resulting  in   a  cumulative  rise  in  the   repo  rate  of  125bp  to  4. 75%  since  its  trough  in   November 2003.  For  2004  as  a  whole,  it  is  now  estimated  that  growth   is  likely  to  be  around  3.3%,  above  the  Commission’s   spring forecast of 3.0%.   Prospects for  2005 and 2006  Firm  growth  is  expected   to  continue  throughout  the   forecast period, moderating slightly to around 2¾% in  both  2005  and  2006.  Final  domestic  demand  should   weaken  in  2005  and  2006,  as   the  impact  of  tighter   monetary  policy  takes  effect,  while  improved  world   demand   is   expected   to   lead   to   a   small   positive    contribution to growth from  net exports in 2005.   Household  consumption  in  real  terms  is  expected  to   slow to around 2¼% in 20 05 and a little less in 2006 -  following  interest  rate  rises,  this  also  reflects  the   impact   of   an   expected   slowing   in   house   price    inflation.   Signs   of   a   cooling   housing   market   are    becoming  more  evident,  with  recent  slowdowns  in   lending and mortgage approvals. However, the overall  impact    on    consumption    from    slower    house    price  growth  is  expected  to   be  relatively  mild,  especially   since  household  net  wealth   holdings  are  still  healthy.   The  build-up  in  household  debt  in  recent  years  is  not   regarded  as  a  major  risk:  most  appears  to  have  been   used either to invest in housing improvements (i.e. re- invested  in  the  housing  market),  or  the  acquisition  of   financial  assets,  rather  than   to  finance  consumption.   The strength of the labour  market should also provide  further  support  to   household  confidence  in  the  event   of  a  more  marked  downturn  in  the  housing  market.   All in all, the saving ratio should rise gently over the  forecast period.   Government     consumption     in     line     with     the      government’s  plans  will  support  growth  throughout   the forecast period. Fixed investment should moderate  slightly  from  robust  growth   in  2004,  but  will  remain   strong  –  also  reflecting  gove rnment  plans  to  increase   public    investment    –    with    slower    construction     investment  offset,  particularly  in  2005,  by  continued   firm growth in equipment investment.  The   strength   of   recovery   in   the   global   economy    should   contribute   to   an   improvement   in   UK   net    exports, despite the strength of equipment investment  helping  to  sustain  demand  for  imports.    Net  exports   should contribute positively  to output growth in 2005,  with  the  net  trade  contribu tion  returning  to  around   balance in 2006 as global demand slows.  Labour market, costs and prices  Unemployment  is  expected  to  remain  low  and  stable   at  around  5%,  close  to  its  estimated  NAIRU  level,   throughout  the  forecast  period.  Employment  growth   should  be  more  moderate  than  in  recent  years,  as   employment   levels   are   already   relatively   high   by    international  standards.  Wage   growth  should  increase   given the strength of the la bour market, particularly as  bonus   payments   are   increasingly   likely   to   reflect    improvements     in     corpora te     profitability.     With      productivity  growth  expected   to  remain  firm,  unit   labour cost increases should be moderate.  Pressure  on  consumer  prices  should  also  increase;   although  signs  of  a  pic kup  in  inflation  are  muted   despite recent oil price rises, with HICP inflation only  1.1% in the year to Sept ember 2004, it is expected to  rise towards its 2% target by the end of 2005, not least  as  signs  of  emerging  pressu re  in  producer  prices  are   evident.  Some  further  tig htening  of  monetary  policy   by the authorities is commonly expected.  Public finances  The general government finances recorded a deficit of  3.3%  of  GDP  in  2003,  significantly  higher  than  had   been   forecast   by   the   authorities   in   April   2003.    Composition effects in GDP growth resulted in lower- than-expected   receipts   from   taxes   on   corporate    income  and  wages  and  salaries.  Further,  there  were   additional discretionary expe nditure related to the Iraq  war and measures to combat terrorism.  So far in 2004, data suggest some improvement in the  first  half  of  the  year,  but  considerable  uncertainty   hangs   over   future   developments.   The   deficit   is    expected  to  narrow  over  the  forecast  period,  with   growth in general government consumption projected  to  slow  relative  to  2004,  and  revenues  to  recover   relative to nomin al income.   Revenues, particularly taxes on household income and  corporate  profits,  sh ould  increase  as  a  result  of  still   relatively strong GDP growth, albeit at a slower pace  than was forecast by the au thorities in the March 2004  Budget.   However,   risks   to    this   forecast   remain    significant,  because  of  a  hi gh  degree  of  uncertainty   over  the  future  development  of  tax  revenues.  Under   the  UK’s  system  of  corporation  tax,  in  particular,   companies pay on the basis of expected profits for the  year,  but  are  not  penalised   for  underestimating  profit   in  the  early  part  of  the  year.  Thus,  while  higher   corporate   profitability   should   soon   begin   to   feed    through  into  tax  receipts,  data  so  far  give  little  guide   to  the  likely  development  of  receipts  in  the  fourth   quarter of this year.  On   the   expenditure   side,   growth   of   government    spending is expected to slow, broadly in line with the  plans   set   out   by   the   government   in   the   Budget.    Historically, there has been a tendency to underspend  relative   to   target,   but   in   a   period   of   slowing    expenditure,   government   departments   may   find   it    more  difficult  to  adjust   to  tighter  budgets.  Indeed,   expenditure in 2004 has been relatively strong so far;  while  it  is  difficult  to  draw   conclusions  about  the   likely  path  of  expenditure  from  these  developments,   there  remains  some  risk,  therefore,  that  government   spending will be higher than is currently forecast.  In   order   to   strengthen    efforts   to   improve   public    services as the rate of e xpenditure increase slows, the  authorities   announced   plan s   in   summer   2004   to    significantly   enhance   efficiency   across   the   public    sector  (including  through  so me  cuts  in  employment).   However there is not expected to be any net impact on  the  public  finances,  since  the  government  has  stated   that  any  expenditure  savings  are  to  be  redirected  to   priority areas.  In total, the projected def icit declines to a little below  3% of GDP in 2004 and to around 2½% in both 2005  and  2006.  The  ratio  of  gr oss  debt  to  GDP,  though   increasing  slightly,  is  expected  to  remain  close  to   40%.    However,    as    noted     above,    considerable     uncertainty remains over the fu ture path of the deficit.  Risks  remain  and  a  deficit  figure  higher  than  3%  in   2004 can not be excluded. 		
November/2004	Bulgaria	Continuing high growth on the basis of strong domestic demand 	Recent economic developments  The  Bulgarian  economy  continued  its  expansion  at  a   rate of 5.6% in the first half of 2004. Growth is based  on strong domestic demand fuelled by increases in net  income,   employment   and   bank   credit.   While   this    results   in   high   import   growth,   exports   were   also    getting stronger over the summer. On the supply side,  the   good   harvest,   a   strong   increase   in   industrial    production and a good tourism season are contributing  to the high output growth.  Following a period of low inflation in the first months  of 2003, rates have accelerated since mid-2003 due to  higher  food  prices,  as  a  consequence  of  a  drought- related  bad  harvest  in  2003,  as  well  as  increases  in   excise  tax  rates,  administrative  prices  and  import   prices.  Unemployment  decreased  to  12.0%  in  June   2004 since jobs are being created in the private sector  and     in     government     schemes     for     long-term      unemployed.  The  current   account  deficit,  which  had   deteriorated  to  8.6%  of  GDP  in  2003,  showed  an   improvement  in  the  first  seven  months  of  2004  in  all   its balances except for the tr ade deficit. Net inflows of  foreign direct investment in  2004 were at record highs  and fully covering the current account deficit.  Prospects for 2 004 to 2006   GDP  growth  is  expected  to  achieve  around  5½%  for   the  full  year  2004,  to  accelerate  to  a  rate  of  6%  in   2005   and   to   moderate   to   4½%   in   2006.   The    acceleration  in  2004  and  2005  will  be  based  on   continued   strong   domestic   demand   resulting   in   a    highly   imbalanced   growth   composition.   In   2005,    growth    will    be    further    stimulated    by    already     announced  measures  of  slightly  expansionary  fiscal   and  wage  policies  in  view  of  national  elections  by   mid-2005.  This  is  likely   to  be  followed  by  some   adjustment  in  2006  to  re balance  the  economy  and  to   bring  it  closer  to  its  medium-term  potential  growth   rate. The   projected   growth   path,   driven   by   a   similar    development  of  domestic  demand  and,  on  the  supply   side,  a  good  performance  of  all  three  broad  sectors,   will  continue  to  trigger  substantial  imports  given  the   still  weak  industrial  base  of  the  economy.  Private   consumption will remain very strong because of high  credit growth, higher employment and increases in net  income, the latter also arisi ng from cuts in income tax  rates  and  a  25%  increase  in  the  minimum  wage   planned  for  2005.  These  effects  on  consumption  are   likely  to  moderate  in  2006 ,  but  strong  investment  in   view of the opportunities expected from EU accession  in  2007  should  prevent  the  economy  from  a  more   significant  slowdown.  Net  exports  have  a  strongly   negative  contribution  to  GDP  growth  until  becoming   less negative in 2006 as a result of a slower expansion  of private consumption.  Consumer  price  inflation  is  expected  to  be  lower  in   the  second  half  of  2004  than   in  the  first  half  of  the   year,  largely  because  of  a  better  harvest  which  keeps   food  prices  low.  However,  it  is  unlikely  to  be  below   5%  at  the  end  of  the  year  and  6%  on  average  also   because   of   the   higher   oil   price.   Wage   increases    beyond  what  is  warranted   by  productivity  growth  are   likely  to  bring  some  upward  pressure  on  prices  in   2005. These effects should ease in 2006, but catching- up effects will make it diff icult to achieve  an average  inflation rate of less than 4%.  In   view   of   continuing   high   GDP   growth,   net    employment gains would make an unemployment rate  of  10%  or  lower  possible  in   2006.  This  assumes  that   the  induced  increase  in  the   participation  rate  is  likely   to  be  higher  than  the  d ecline  in  the  working-age   population.  Public finance  In view of the strong revenue performance in the first  eight  months  of  2004,  the  forecast  projects  that  the   general  government  budget   balance  will  achieve  a surplus of ½% of GDP at the end of the current year.  The expected deficit in 2005 of -1% of GDP is taking  account   of   plans   to   further   reduce   tax   rates   on    corporate     profits     and     personal     income.     The      continuation  of  a  primary  surplus  and  of  high  GDP   growth will further reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over  the forecasting hor izon to a more su stainable level.  External balances The  deficit  of  the  trade  balance  is  expected  to  widen   further  until  2005  as  a  resu lt  of  higher  import  prices   and   strong   domestic   demand.   It   is   projected   to    decrease  in  2006  due  to  mo re  favourable  terms  of   trade  and  a  gradual  improvement  in  competitiveness   arising from high fixed inve stment for several years.  As   a   consequence,   the   current   account   deficit   is    forecast  to  remain  high  until  2005  and  to  drop  more   significantly  only  in  2006 .  Favourable  developments   in  tourism,  debt  service  obligations  and  EU  transfers   will   improve   the   income,    services   and   current    transfers  balances,  respectively,  and  partly  dissociate   the  performance  of  the  current  account  deficit  from   that of the trade deficit. Net foreign direct investment  is  likely  to  fully  cover  the  current  account  deficit  in   2004  since  further  inflows  related  to  some  major   privatisations  can  be  expect ed  until  the  end  of  the   year.		
November/2004	Croatia	Weaker domestic demand and stronger foreign demand 	Recent economic developments   In   the   first   half   of   2 004,   the   Croatian   economy    expanded  at  a  rate  of  4%,  somewhat  lower  than  the   4.3%  increase  in  2003  as  a  whole.  As  a  result  of   tighter monetary policies, growth of domestic demand  decelerated from 6% in 2003 to 4%. The contribution  of  gross  fixed  capital  formation  to  growth  declined   from 4% to 2% in the same period, due to the gradual  termination    of    public    investment    projects.    Net     external  demand  continued  to  be  a  drag  on  economic   output,  although  to  a  lesser  extent  as  compared  to   2003,  pointing  to  a  gradually  improving  performance   of exports of goods and se rvices. On the supply side,  industrial  output  growth   decelerated  from  a  strong   5.6%  year  on  year  in  the  first  quarter  to  a  modest   2.2% in the second quarter.  Average  consumer  price  inflation  increased  to  2.3%   in the second quarter compared to 1.8% in 2003 as a  whole, mainly as a result of  higher prices for housing,  energy  and  transport.  Labour  force  survey  data  point   to an unemployment rate  of 14.5% in 2003.    During  the  first  eight  m onths  of  2004,  merchandise   exports expanded by 14%, while imports grew by 6%.  As a result of such improved export performance, the  trade and current account deficits narrowed during the  first half of 2004. The trade deficit stood at 26.3% of  GDP  compared  to  27.4%  in  2003  as  a  whole.  In  the   twelve months to June, the current account recorded a  deficit  of  6.5%  of  that  period’s  GDP,  down  from  7%   of GDP in 2003.    Prospects   In  2004,  real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  decline  to   3.8%,  as  a  consequence  of  the  continuation  of  tight   monetary    policies    curtailing    credit    growth    and     domestic  demand.  The  growth  rate  is  forecast  to   accelerate  to  4%  in  2005  and  to  4.5%  in  2005,  based   on   the   assumption   of   ongoing   privatisation   and    restructuring  in  the  industry   and  tourism  sector  and  a   generally positive external environment.  Private consumption growth is expected to decelerate  in  2004  to  3.5%,  but  will  gr adually  increase  to  4.2%   in  2006.  Gross  fixed  investment  will  grow  by  7.3%   this  year,  down  from  the  exceptional  high  rate  of   almost   17%   in   2003,   reflecting   slowing   public    investments.  Investment  growth  is  forecast  to  further   decline   to   5.4%   and   4%    in   2004   and   2005,    respectively.      Real   export   growth   is   expected   to    accelerate  on  the  back  of  stronger  external  demand,   market  share  gains,  and  a  strong  performance  of  the   tourism  sector.  Real  imports  are  expected  to  grow  at   lower,  but  still  increasing  rates,  reflecting  moderate   domestic demand growth and a relatively high import  content of merchandise and services exports.   Accordingly,   the   contribution   to   GDP   growth   is    expected to change over the forecast period, reflecting  weaker  domestic  and  stronger  net  foreign  demand.   The contribution of domestic demand falls from 6.5%  to  a  still  strong  3.7%  in  both  2005  and  2006.  The   effect  on  growth  of  the  foreign  balance  is  neutral  in   2004. Net exports will cont ribute positively to growth  in 2005 with 0.5%, an d with 0.9%  in 2006.  Annual  average  consumer  price  inflation  is  expected   to  remain  below  3%  over  the  forecast  horizon,  as   pressures  from  domestic  demand  remain  moderate.  It   will increase from 2.4% in 200 4 to 2.8% in 2006 as a  result   of   administrative   price   adjustments,   higher    indirect taxes and price increas es of non-tr adables. In  view of the accelerating GDP growth, employment is  forecast  to  increase  by  around  1%  per  year  over  the   forecast  period.  This  supports  a  gradual  reduction  of   the unemployment rate  to 13.2% in  2006.   Public finances   The  general  government  deficit  is  expected  to  be   reduced  from  the  unexpected  high  6.3%  deficit  in   2003  to  around  4.5%  in   2004.  The  reduction  will  be   mainly brought about by  announced one-off measures  on the revenue side.   The   forecast   assumes   a   further   reduction   of   the    government deficit to 3.9% in  2005 and 3.6% in 2006,  in  line  with  the  governmen t  strategy  to  reduce  the   domestic   savings-investment   gap   of   the   economy    through  a  policy  of  fiscal   consolidation.  From  2005   on,    the    adjustment    is    expected    to    take    place     predominantly  on  the  expend iture  side.  Cost  savings   will   arise   from   ongoing   health   sector   reform,   a    downsizing of personnel in  public administration, and  enhanced  financial  discipline  of  public  enterprises.   Envisaged  tax  reforms  are  expected  to  be  largely   revenue-neutral.    As  a  result  of  fiscal  consolidation,  the  government   debt-to-GDP ratio will decline from 52.7% in 2004 to  51.1% of GDP in 2006.     External balances The trade balance is expected to slightly improve over  the  forecast  period  as  a  result  of  accelerating  export   growth,     weaker     domestic     demand     and     an      improvement in the terms of trade. The trade deficit in  2004   will   decline   to   26 .9%   of   GDP   and   further    improve   in   2005   and   2006.   The   current   account    deficit is forecast to be gradually reduced from 7% of  GDP  in  2003  to  a  more  sustainable  level  of  5.0%  at   the   end   of   the   forecast   period.   This   is   mainly    explained  by  an  improved  performance  of  services   exports,   mainly   tourism,    which   are   projected   to    increase  by  a  real  10%  per  year  in  both  2005  and   2006.  		
November/2004	Romania	In the high gear– buoyant demand and widening trade deficit  	Recent economic developments  In  2003,  Romania’s  four-year  old  economic  recovery   continued,  as  real  GDP  grew  by  4.9%.  However,   growth   was   increasingly   unbalanced   and   mainly    driven  by  domestic  demand.  Household  consumption   rose  strongly  by  7.1%,  driven  by  surging  consumer   credit  and  high  wage  growth.    With  a  real  growth  of   4.6%,    government    consum ption    also    expanded     considerably.  Gross  fixed  capital  formation  increased   rapidly  at  9.2%,  pointing  to  the  ongoing  replacement   of  Romania’s  capital  stock.  This  strong  domestic   demand  led  to  a  sustained  import  growth  of  16.3%,   while  export  growth  decelerated,  reaching  11.1%  for   the  year.  Consequently,  net  exports  turned  strongly   negative  during  2003,  and  th e  current  account  deficit   widened significantly to 5.8% of GDP.   During  the  first  half  of   2004,  preliminary  figures   show  that  GDP  grew  by  6.6%  y-o-y.  Growth  was   driven   by   a   further   stre ngthening   of   household    consumption  to  9%  y-o-y,  on  the  back  of  high  real   wage   gains,   and   by   strong   gross   fixed   capital    formation    of    10.4%    y-o-y.    Although    exports     accelerated   to   a   double-digit   growth   rate,   they    continue  to  be  outpaced  by  rapid  import  growth  of   both consumer and investment goods. As a result, the  trade deficit widened further.   Prospects for 2004-06   The  outlook  for  the  Romanian  economy  points  to   strong  growth,  a  further  decline  in  inflation  and  a   considerable,   but   stable,    current   account   deficit.    Relative  to  the  Spring  2004   forecast,  a  remarkably   good  harvest  as  well  as  the  acceleration  of  both   domestic   and   external   demand   cause   an   upward    revision of GDP growth for 2004. Growth is expected  to  gradually  moderate  over  2005  and  2006  on  the   back of a less favourable external environment as well  as    more    subdued    gove rnment    and    household     consumption.   GDP growth and components  For  2004,  real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  accelerate   to 7.2% on the back of buoyant domestic demand and  high  agricultural  output.  Ho usehold  consumption  is   forecasted to expand by 8.0% in 2004 due to high real  wage   growth,   a   permanent   effect   on   disposable    income from lower social se curity contributions and a  surge in the rural  population’s own co nsumption as a  result  of  the  good  harvest.  In  2005  and  2006,  private   consumption  is  expected  to  decelerate  due  to  the   impact   of   energy   price   hikes   on   real   disposable    income , a  tighter  fiscal  stance  and  slower  consumer   credit   growth.   Investment   growth   is   expected   to    remain   strong   at   around   10%   annually   over   the    forecasting  period  due  to  the  ongoing  modernisation   of  production  facilities,  a  st ructural  change  towards   less    labour-intensive    pr oduction    and    ambitious     motorway projects. Export  growth, increasing inflows  of  FDI  and  improved  access  to  financing  will  also   support   investments.   The   negative   contribution   to    GDP growth from net exports  is expected to diminish  as growth slows.  Inflation Inflation  is  expected  to  remain  on  a  downward  path.   The  continued  fall  in  consumer  price  inflation  is   underpinned    by    a    moderation    of    inflationary     expectations  in  the  economy  and  supported  by  a   coherent   policy   mix.   Productivity   gains   due   to    industrial  restructuring  and  investments  as  well  as  a   lower  rate  of  depreciation  of  the   lei   are  expected  to   contribute to further mitigati ng inflationary pressures.  Higher    global    energy    prices    are    expected    to     increasingly feed through from producer to consumer  prices. In combination with the ongoing adjustment of  administered   energy   end-user   prices   and   robust    economic activity, this may cause inflation to decline  at a slowing pace in 2005-06.  Labour market  The   unemployment   rate   is   expected   to   remain    stable  at  around  6.6%  agains t  the  background  of   slowly  falling  employment  and  declining  labour   market   participation.   Grow th   in   private   sector    employment  will  continue  to  mitigate  the  effect   from  lay-offs  caused  by  th e  restructuring  of  state- owned     enterprises,     but     the     relatively     low      unemployment   rate   may   come   to   an   end   as    economic restructuring, including in the agricultural  sector,  deepens.  Labour  market  trends  should  be   interpreted  with  caution  as  data  are  affected  by   revisions and chan ging methodology.  Public finances  Against  the  background  of   strong  revenue  growth,   the   fiscal   policy   stance   was   adjusted   by   two    supplementary  budg ets  in  July  and  August  2004,   bringing the 2004 general  government deficit target   for 2004 down to 1.6% of  GDP from the originally  budgeted  3.0%  of  GDP.  This  target  is  expected  to   be  met.  In  2005,  the  fiscal  stance  is  expected  to   adjust to the need of containing the current account  deficit,   while   still   benefiting   from   significant    revenue    growth.    On    ba lance,    however,    the     introduction  of  important  ta x  cuts  is  expected  to   lead to an increasing general government deficit.  External balances  Buoyant    private    consumption    and    investment     activity will continue to drive imports up and result  in a persistent trade deficit. Increasing transfers will  mitigate  the  impact  on  the  current  account  deficit,   which   is   expected   to   remain   stable   over   the    forecasting     period.     Increasing     FDI     inflows,      improved  access  to  international  financial  markets   and  large  international  reserves  will  facilitate  the   financing of the deficit. 		
April/2005	Belgium	Slowing down after a strong 2004 	Strong economic recovery in 2004  The economic recovery in  Belgium which had started  in the second half of 2003  continued in  2004. Despite  a slowdown in the last quarter, GDP grew by 2.7% on  average (compared to 1.3% in 2003).   The  recovery  was  led  by  do mestic  demand  (which   contributed to GDP growth by 2.3 percentage points),  compared    to    a    0.2    percentage    point    negative     contribution    from    the    external    balance.    Private     consumption  rose  by  2.3%   in  2004,  supported  by   strong        consumer        confi dence.        Government         consumption  is  estimated  to   have  increased  by  3.3%   in real terms, partly as a result of high expenditure in  health  care.  After  two  consecutive  years  of  negative   growth,  gross  capital  formation  picked  up  by  1.6%,   supported  by  improved  cor porate  balance  sheets,  low   interest   rates   and   strong   dome stic   and   external    demand.  Both  imports  and  exports  rose  strongly  in   2004,  led  by  robust  domestic  demand  and  buoyant   external    market    growth.     Cumulated    losses    in     competitiveness  due  to  a   strong  euro  in  the  last  two   years  partly  explain  the  s lightly  higher  growth  in   imports.   After a reduction in employm ent in 2002, followed by  a standstill in 2003, employmen t picked up in 2004 by  an   estimated   0.7%.   However,   the   effect   on   the    unemployment  rate  was  limited  due  to  an  increase  in   the  labour  force.  The  strong  growth  in  economic   activity,   accompanied   by   a   moderate   increase   in    employment  led  to  increased  pr oductivity,  as  is  usual   in the first stage of an upswing. Inflation increased in  the  second  half  of  2004,  mainly  as  a  result  of  higher   oil prices. However, the overall increase in HICP was  limited to 1.9% in 2004.   Prospects for 2005 and 2006  The  slowdown  of  economic  activity  in  the  fourth   quarter of 2004 (accompanied by increasing oil prices  and  lower  growth  in  other  EU  countries,  particularly   Germany),  is  expected  to   result  in  lower  economic   growth  in  2005  (2.2%).  Ho wever,  the  underlying   fundamentals   of   domestic   demand   remain   fairly    strong. Consumer  confidence  was  relatively  high  throughout   2004.   Consumption   is   sup ported   by   the   ongoing    income  tax  reform  and  seems  to  benefit  from  the   government’s  increased  credibility  in  terms  of  fiscal   consolidation. The evolution of the Belgian household  savings  rate,  which  has  been  on  a  downward  trend   since 1993, shows a positiv e correlation with the debt  ratio (see graph 3.1).   Gross capital formation is exp ected to be quite strong  in  2005  and  2006,  as  suggested  by  the  results  of   investment    surveys    and     in    view    of    the    high     profitability  and  sound  fin ancial  position  of  Belgian   enterprises.  Public  investmen t  in  particular  should   increase markedly in  2005 and the first half of 2006 in  the  run-up  to  the  2006  local  elections.  On  the  other   hand,    government    consumption    is    expected    to     decrease  as  a  result  of  ongoing  fiscal  consolidation   and  the  expected  higher  control  over  health  care   expenditure.   In  view  of  robust  GDP  growth  and  continued  wage   moderation,  further  increases  in  employment  in  2005   and  2006  are  expected.  In  line  with  the  expected   average     wage     evolution     in     the     three     main      neighbouring  countries  (G ermany,   France   and   the    Netherlands),  the  new  national  wage  agreement  for   2005–2006   foresees   a    cumulated   indicative   4.5%    nominal wage increase over the two years, lower than  the previous 5.3% for 2003–2004.  Public finances: Still some  challenges ahead  In  2004,  the  government  accounts  reached  a  small   surplus  of  0.1%  of  GDP.  This  was  the  result  of   higher-than-expected tax in come, mainly VAT, direct  taxes and the proceeds of the tax amnesty law, which  more    than    outweighed    the    overrun    in    health     expenditure.   For  2005,  a  small  deficit  of  0.2%  of  GDP  can  be   expected,  mainly  due  to  lower  economic  growth  and   less  income  from  one-off   measures  (particularly  the   discontinuation  of  the   tax  amnesty  and  lower  sales   from  real  estate).  There  is  also  some  uncertainty   regarding the impact of measures to control spending  in   health   care.   As   for   2006,   a   somewhat   more    substantial deficit of 0.6% of GDP can be expected in  a  no-policy-change  scenario  and  in  the  absence  of   one-off receipts. Although less than in 2004 (0.7% of  GDP),  one-off  measures  still  account  for  some  0.3%   of  GDP  in  the  2005  budget,  whereas  nothing  is   planned   at   this   stage   for   2006.   Moreover,   the    implementation  of  the  2001  direct  tax  reform  will   have its main impact in 2006, with direct tax proceeds  being  reduced  by  an  additio nal  0.3%  of  GDP.  So  far   the   government   has   not   yet   announced   any   new    measures  that  could  compensate  for  these  income   losses in 2006.  The debt ratio, which fell to  95.6% of GDP at the end  of  2004,  is  expected  to  remain  on  a  downward  trend   until  the  end  of  the  fo recast  period,  as  a  result  of   primary  surpluses  and  d eclining  interest  payments.   However, the decrease in interest payments is slowing  down   and   the   primary   surpluses   are   expected   to    remain   on   a   downward   trend.   In   2005,   the   debt    reduction  is  expected  to  slow   down  as  a  result  of  the   anticipated  assumption  of  a  EUR  7.4  billion  debt   (2.5%  of  GDP)  from  the  national  railway  company   SNCB.		
April/2005	czech Republic	Strong export growth fuelled by FDI 	The economy in 2004  In  2004,  real  GDP  growth   was  solid,  reaching  4%.   Economic  activity  was  driven   mainly  by  net  exports   and investment. Investment grew  by 9.1%. Exports of  goods  and  services  increased  by  20.9%,  in  spite  of  a   substantial appreciation of the Czech koruna. Imports  rose   by   18.5%   and   the   trade   balance   improved    considerably. The significant increase in foreign trade  volumes  was  mainly  due  to  the  elimination  of  the   remaining trade barriers with the key trading partners  after  EU  accession.  Growth  of  private  consumption   decelerated  to  2.5%  against  the  backdrop  of  slowing   real   wage   growth   and   higher   taxes.   Government    consumption  fell  by  3.2%,  which  was  a  considerable   change compared with the 4.2% increase in 2003.  Inflation  in  2004  was  low,  as  the  increase  of  raw   material and oil prices was of fset by the strengthening  domestic   currency.   HICP   inflation   reached   2.6%;    about   half   of   the   price   increase   was   caused   by    administrative     measures     (mainly     indirect     tax      increases). The labour market was slow to react to the  pick-up  in  economic  activ ity.  Employment  continued   to decline (-0.5%) and the rate of unemployment was  8.3%. The 2004 trade deficit  of -0.8% of GDP was the  lowest  since  1993.  The  improving  balance  in  goods   and services more than outwei ghed the increase in the  deficit  in  the  income  ba lance,  so  that  the  current   account deficit fell to 5.2% of GDP.  Outlook for 2005-2006  GDP growth is expected to remain  at 4% in 2005 and  to  slightly  accelerate  to  4.2%  in  2006,  being  still   driven  mainly  by  investment ,  notably  foreign  direct   investment   and   reinvested    profits   of   established    foreign   firms.   Improving    competitiveness   of   the    industrial  sector  will  stimulate  exports.  Growth  of   private    consumption    is    projected    to    somewhat     accelerate  owing  to  the  slightly  higher  growth  of   disposable  income.  Public  consumption  is  forecast  to   grow in 2005 and to further accelerate in 2006, mainly  in the run-up to  the general election.  On the external side,  the trend of increasing deficits in  the  income  balance  is  expected  to  continue  in  2005   and  2006.  This  trend  is  projected  to  be  more  than   offset   by   the   improving   balance   of   goods   and    services.  The  surplus  in  the  service  balance  should   rise,   but   only   slightly,   wh ile   the   negative   trade    balance is forecast to turn into  a small surplus in 2005  (0.1% of GDP) which sh ould further increase in 2006  (0.5% of GDP). Exports should be further boosted by  the launch of production at a new car plant. All in all,  the  current  account  deficit  is  projected  to  decrease  to   4.7%  of  GDP  in  2005,  rem aining  broadly  stable  in   2006.   The   capital   balance   is   expected   to   further    improve,  mainly  due  to   capital  inflows  from  the  EU   funds.  Labour market, costs and prices  Despite  a  relatively  strong  economic  performance   which  is  expected  to  accelerate,  the  unemployment   rate is projected to remain at ab out 8.3% in 2005 and  in  2006.  The  trend  of  falling  employment  is  forecast   to slow down. Developmen ts in the labour market are  shaped  by  both  ongoing  re structuring,  reflected  in   strong  productivity  gains,  main ly  in  the  industrial   sector,  and  by  difficulties   in  finding  employment  for   some  segments  of  the  labour  force,  partly  due  to   insufficient incentives to take up jobs.  At  the  beginning  of  2005,  inflation  again  dropped   below   the   inflation   target    band   and   a   return   is    expected only in the second half of the year (the target  is   CPI   inflation   of   2-4%   y-o-y   by   the   end   of    December  2005).  As  the  risks  of  cost  push  inflation   have  faded  and  demand  pressures  are  expected  to  be   very  weak,  the  central  bank  cut  the  base  rate  at  the   end  of  January  from  2.5%  to  2.25%.  Average  HICP   inflation  is  expected  to  attain   1.9%  in  2005.  In  2006,   inflation should accelerate, reaching 2.6% on average,  broadly in line with th e monetary policy target (of 3%  y-o-y with a tolerance of  +/-1 pp as of 2006).  Public finances  Developments  in  public  finances  in  2004  were  better   than  expected,  partly  as  a  resu lt  of  stronger  growth   and  partly  as  a  result  of  the  change  in  the  budgetary   rules in mid-2004 which made it possible for the first  time to roll-over unspent fund s into 2005. The general  government  deficit  was  3%  of  GDP,  far  below  the   target  foreseen  in  the  last   convergence  programme   (5.2%  of  GDP).  As  a  consequence,  the  budgetary   outcome  in  2005  has  become  very  uncertain,  since   expenditures  in  2005  will   be  influenced  by  how  the   unspent  funds  rolled  over  from  2004  (totalling  about   1% of GDP) are allocated.   Given  a  record  of  expenditure  overestimation  and   revenue  underestimation  in  the  Czech  budget,  the   forecast  for  the  2005  general  government  deficit  is   4.5%  of  GDP,  slightly  below  the  target  set  in  the   convergence    programme    (4.7%    of    GDP).    This     projection  assumes  that  half   of  the  funds  rolled  over   from 2004 will be spent in 200 5 and it also takes into  account  one-off  military  expenditures.  If,  however,   the  budget  is  implemented   rigorously  and  the  room   for  spending,  as  foreseen   in  the  2005  budget,  is  not   fully used, like in 2004 , the deficit could be lower.  In   the   absence   of   specific   measures   which   are    necessary  to  reach  the  target  of  3.8%  of  GDP  in  the   election  year  2006,  the  projection  for  that  year  is   based on the no-policy change assumption. Therefore,  the expenditure ceilings are  not taken in to account for  2006, and the deficit is pr ojected to reach 4% of GDP.  Gross  public  debt  is  expected   to  decline   in  2005  to   36.4%   of   GDP,   mainly   thanks   to   privatisation    proceeds.  In  2006,  debt  is  projected  to  reach  37%  of   GDP. 		
April/2005	Denmark	Consumer spending booms, net exports burden GDP growth 	The economy in 2004  The  recovery  of  economi c  activity  in  Denmark  was   confirmed   in   2004.   GDP   growth   was   driven   by    domestic  demand,  in  particular  private  consumption,   which  reached  its  highest  growth  rate  since  1994.   Backed  by  strong  consumer  confidence,  household   spending   was   boosted   by   the   March   2004   fiscal    package.  This  resu lted  in  substan tial  increases  in  real   disposable incomes due to  income tax cuts, as well as  the    suspension    (in    2004    and    2005)    of    the     contributions to a mandatory pension savings scheme.  Robust  increases  in  car  sales   contributed  notably  to   the     strength     of     private     consumption.     Public      consumption  grew  only  m odestly,  in  line  with  the   government’s  targets.  Investment  growth  accelerated   in   the   second   half   of   the   year,   in   particular   for    equipment   investment.   Ex ports   grew   moderately,    leading  to  a  sizeable  loss  of  market  share.  The  surge   in  domestic  demand  entailed   a  sharp  rise  in  imports   resulting  in  a  markedly  nega tive  growth  contribution   from net exports.  Prospects for 2005 and 2006   The strong growth in domestic demand is expected to  continue   in   2005,   albeit   decelerating.   Domestic    demand  continues  to  drive  economic  activity  and   should lead to GDP grow th of 2¼%, somewhat higher  than  in  2004.  A lso  in  2005,  private  consumption  is   expected   to   be   boosted   by   the   tax   cuts   and   the    continued  suspension  of  the  special  pension  savings,   which   frees   funds   for   consumption.   Against   the    background of positive industr y confidence indicators,  investment  growth  is  set  to   remain  robust  as  foreign   demand    remains    high    and    capacity    utilisation     increases.   In   particular,   housing   investment   will    benefit   from   rising   house   prices   and   favourable    financing conditions and is set to expand vigorously.  While   strengthening   mode rately   in   2005,   export    growth  is  still  set  to  be  lower   than  that  of  export   markets.  A  loss  of  market  shares  in  an  upswing  is  a   recurrent phenomenon in Denmark and in part linked  to the composition of  exports. Moreover, the strength  of  the  krone  vis-à-vis   the  US  dollar  and  relatively   high wage increases in recent years have put pressure  on  competitiveness.  Imports  are  expected  to  grow   strongly in 2005 though less so than in 2004, with the  negative    growth    contribution    from    net    exports     decreasing.  As  a  consequence  of  the  relatively  strong   imports, the current account  surplus shou ld weaken.  In  2006,  private  consumption  growth  is  expected  to   dampen   as   the   special   pension   saving   scheme   is    reinstated  after  its  two-year  suspen sion.  Though  still   losing  market  shares,  exports  will  grow  at  a  fairly   robust   pace   against   the   background   of   sustained    export  market  growth.  Import  growth  is  expected  to   decelerate  due  to  lower  domestic  demand  and  the   contribution  to  growth   from  net  exports  will  turn   slightly   positive.   On   this   basis,   GDP   growth   is    expected   to   be   just   abov e   2%,   around   the   level    assessed to be sustainable in the medium term.  Labour market, costs and prices   The labour market started to im prove in 2004, but the  recovery has so far been hesitant. Employment fell in  the  fourth  quarter,  but  grew  slightly  for  2004  as  a   whole.  However,  as  the  labour  force  also  increased,   average  unemployment  was  higher  than  in  2003.  In   seasonally adjusted terms, unemployment edged down  in the last part of 2004 an d in the beginning of 2005.  In view of the present strength of domestic demand, it  is  expected  that  the  labour   market  will  turn  and   unemployment  fall  at  a  more  sustained  pace.  The   improvement  in  the  labour  market  is  expected  to   continue   through   the   period,   with   unemployment    reaching  4½%  in  2006.  Private  sector  wage  growth   has  been  decelerating,  particularly  as  a  result  of  the   weak  labour  market  and  low  inflation,  declining  to  a   yearly  growth  rate  of  below  3%   in  early  2005.  Over   the  forecast  period,  wage  growth  is  expected  to  rise   moderately as the labour market tightens.   Consumer  price  inflation  was  markedly  subdued  in   2004, with average HICP inflation at 0.9%, the lowest  rate since the 1950s. The dampened inflation was due  to reductions in excise duties and falling import prices  as well as to decelerating wage growth. In the forecast  period,  consumer  price  inflation  is  set  to  increase  as   the effects of the reduction in excise duties fall out of  the yearly comparisons, a nd import and energy prices  are  expected  to  rise  in  2005.  In  2006,  inflation  is   expected to further edge somewhat higher as capacity  pressure in the economy increase.  Public finances   Public  finances  are  set  to  remain  sound  over  the   forecast  period.  The  surplus  in  2004  was  2¾%  of   GDP due to an exceptional increase in revenues from  mainly  corporate  and  pension  fund  yield  taxes.  In   2005  and  2006,  a  surplus  of  around  2%  of  GDP  is   expected. The general governme nt balance is boosted  by    lower    labour-market-related    expenditure    and     interest payments, as well as to higher revenues from  oil-related   activities.   The   gr owth   of   real   public    consumption  in  2004  was  below  the  target  for  that   year, as the instruments applied by the government to  limit  local  government  spend ing,  including  the  tax   freeze, are becoming more binding. In 2005 and 2006  a  yearly  growth  around  the  targeted  ½%  is  therefore   projected.		
April/2005	Germany	Growth to continue despite recent setback 	The situation in 2004  After relatively strong quarterly  growth rates of 0.5%  and   0.4%,   respectively,   in   the   first   two   quarters,    activity  remained  flat  in  the  second  half  of  the  year,   even  recording  a  slight  decline  in  the  fourth  quarter i . In   spite   of   this,   with   a   1.6%   increase   Germany    registered  the  highest  annual  GDP  growth  in  four   years,  helped  by  a  substantial  working  day  effect   estimated at ½ pp.   Net  exports  contributed  over  one  percentage  point  to   overall growth. Germany benefited from lively global  demand,  even  gaining  market  shares  as  unchanged   nominal    wages    translated    into    a    competitive     advantage despite the appreciation of the euro.   Wage  stagnation  and  weak  em ployment  growth,  on   the  other  hand,  made  for  a  slight  decline  in  final   domestic    demand,    extending     to    both    private     consumption  and  investment.  Because  of  this,  and  as   demonstrated  by  the  sluggishness  of  the  last  two   quarters,  the  upswing  therefore  remains  fragile  and   failed to become self-sustaining.  Prospects in 2005 and 2006  The risk of a slide-back into recession is low, as there  are  signs  that  growth  will  resume  already  in  the  first   quarter  of  2005  with  the  same  strength  as  a  year   before.  Indicators  of  consumer  and  business  rose  at   the   beginning   of   the    year,   partly   related   to   the    successful introduction of the “Hartz”-reforms and the  road  toll  system  as  well  as   a  reduction  in  tax  rates.   Likewise,  industrial  order   volumes  both  domestically   and  from  abroad  indicate  a  solid  increase  in  demand   in the near future. Nevert heless, as the starting level at  the  beginning  of  2005  is  low,  a  high  annual  growth   rate can no longer be achieved in spite of an expected  solid increase in economic  activity over the course of  the year. Private consumption, which  still remains below levels  attained  four  years  ago,  is  starting  to  pick  up  again.   Growth, however, will be limited by the slow increase  in  disposable  income  and  employment,  although  a   certain  momentum  could  be   achieved  via  a  reduction   in  the  savings   rate,  which  has  gone   up  substantially   since the mini-boom in 2000.   Lower saving could also be a response to an increase  in employment, even though  this is so far only due to  the   sharp   rise   in   so-called   mini-jobs   under   the    “Hartz”-  reforms.  While  the  reform  also  increased   unemployment  in  the  national  definition  to  over  5   million in January, as a st atistical revision added some  375  000  people,  the  IL O-calculated  unemployment   rate  used  in  this  forecast  remains  largely  unaffected   and  reflects  the  underlying  trend:  Unemployment  is   likely to remain stable until  the middle of the year and  start falling thereafter.  Falling  unit  labour  costs  sh ould  boost  profits  and   ultimately  lead  to   a  turnaround  in  investment,  which   has been falling precipitously over the last few years.  By contrast, construction activity will continue to fall,  as  housing  construction  remains  weak  and  the  poor   state   of   public   finances   constraints   infrastructure    projects. The building sector should benefit, however,  from an increase in commercial construction.   Low  wage  growth  should  also   lead  to  a  continuing   strong  export  performance  over  the  forecast  period,   despite    the    strong    euro.    Germany    has    gained     competitiveness in particular  vis-à-vis other euro-zone  members  with  higher  inflation  rates.  Nevertheless,   export  growth  rates  should  co me  down  from  their   high  2004  levels  as  th e  international  demand  for   investment  goods  slows  down,  for  which  Germany   enjoys   a   comparative   advantage.   Furthermore,   as    import volumes should increase at a faster pace in line  with  domestic  demand,  the   net  export  contribution  to   growth should be close to zero.   As nominal wages have hardly increased, inflationary  pressures  in  Germany  also  re main  very  low,  despite   the  rise  in  energy  prices.  Indeed,  a  full  percentage   point   of   the   2004    CPI    inflation    was    due    to     administered  price  increases  (health  care  and  tobacco   taxes)  and  a  further  0.2   pp  due  to  energy  prices,   leaving less than half a percen t of core inflation and a  GDP deflator well below 1%. This situation looks set  to remain largely unchanged in the near term.  Public finances  The  general  government  deficit  edged  down  to  3.7%   of  GDP  in  2004,  from  3.8%  in  2003.  Government   revenues   fell   by   0.4%.   This   reflects   the   sizeable    income   tax   cuts   worth   0.7%   of   GDP   that   were    implemented  at  the  beginning  of  2004  as  part  of  the   tax relief laws passed in 20 00, which were only partly  financed by a broadening of the tax base. In addition,  lacklustre domestic demand has kept consumption tax  revenues low, in particular fro m oil taxes in the wake  of  rising  oil  prices.  The  increase  in  the  tobacco  tax   rate in March 2004 did not generate as much revenue  as expected by the government. A tax amnesty, aimed  at  repatriating  savings  currently  deposited  undeclared   abroad,    contributed    about    €1bn    to    government     revenues,   far   less   than    planned.   However,   the    unexpected  decline  in  GDP   in  the  fourth  quarter  did   not translate into correspondingly lower tax revenues,  partly  as  a  result  from  the   working-day-adjustment  overdoing  the  decline,  but  also  suggesting  that  the   composition   of   growth   could   become   more   tax- friendly.  General   government   expenditure   fell   by   0.5%   in    nominal  terms.  The  health  sector  reforms  introduced   in the beginning of 2004  substantially reduced public  spending  on  health  care   by  €3.7bn  (worth  almost   0.2%  of  GDP)  compared  with   2003,  which  enabled   the   statutory   health   insu rance   providers   to   run   a    surplus   in   2004,   reducing   the   accumulated   debt.    Pension  expenditure  rose  only  slightly,  reflecting  the   freeze    of    individual    pension    benefits.    Lower     employment  and  continued   cuts  in  bonus  payments   lowered  the  general  government  wage  bill  by  0.9%.   However,   the   ongoing   weakening   of   the   labour    market  led  to  rising  expend iture  on  transfers  such  as   unemployment and social assistance.   In   cyclically-adjusted   terms,    the   deficit   remained    broadly  unchanged  in  2004.  Thus,  with  growth  close   to  potential,  fiscal  policy  was  not  contractionary  in   Germany in 2004. However, all levels of government  continued to face budgetary c onstraints that would not  have permitted any di scretionary loosening.  In 2005, the general governme nt deficit is projected to  fall  to  3.3%  of  GDP.  This  central  estimate  leaves  the   chance  to  avoid  a  fourth  consecutive  breach  of  the   3%-of-GDP  ceiling.  In  cyclically-adjusted  terms,  the   deficit is expected to narrow  by ½ percentage point in  2005.  General  government  revenue  is  expected  to   grow  by  about  1%  despite  the  implementation  of  the   last stage of the tax relief law  from the year 2000, not  least  as  rising  profits  will  lead  to  higher  corporate   taxes.  In  addition,  subsidy  repayments  by  several   Landesbanken   and  the  introduction   of  the  road  toll   will  add  to  revenues.  Slow  growth  of  the  gross  wage   sum   weakens   the   contribution   base   of   the   social    security system. It is thus assumed that the total social  security  contribution  rate   will  fall  only  slightly  in   2005,  despite  the  20 04  surplus  in  th e  health  sector.   Pressure  on  health  insurers  to  lower  the  contribution   rates  further  instead  of   continuing  running  surpluses   to  reduce  their  debt  may  lead  to  a  deficit  higher  than   projected. Expenditures  will  grow  only  by   0.3%.  in  2005  Wage   agreements  in  the  public  sector  are  moderate  and   provide budgetary relief also  in 2006. The dampening  effect  of  the  health  sector  reforms  will  abate  already   in 2005. The implementation of the new social benefit  system  (Hartz  IV-package)  is   projected  to  result  in   expenditure    savings     after    2005.    Subsidies    are     projected to continue falling , while the share of public  investment  in  GDP  is  proj ected  to  remain  constant.   After the release of the Commission services’ autumn  forecast,  the  federal  government  announced  that  the   cash  settlement  office  for  the  former  postal  civil   servants was going to  securitise future transfer income  from  the  post  office’s  successor  companies,  so  that   the federal government would no longer have to make  an annual transfer of 0.25% of GDP to the cash office.  It is assumed that this transaction reduces government  expenditure compatible  with ESA95 accounting rules,  a specific Eurostat decision still pending.   The  main  budgetary  risks  for  2005  are  a  continuing   stagnation of private consump tion translating into tax  shortfalls,  and  the  labour  market  developing  more   unfavourably   than   projected.   Possible   budgetary    implications    resulting    from     the    “jobs    summit”     between  government  and   opposition  on  17  March   2005 are not considered here.  On   unchanged   policies,   the   general   government    deficit  is  projected  to  fall  below  3%  of  GDP  in  2006   by  a  small  margin.  Growing  private  consumption  is   expected  to  bolster  tax  revenues,  while  the  forecast   assumes no further tax cuts.  Tax revenue effects from  growth  shifting  towards  domestic  demand  will  be   reflected  in  a  reduction  of  the  cyclically-adjusted   deficit.  Expenditure  growth  is  expected  to  accelerate   moderately.     A     recovering     labour     market     in      combination with the leg islated labour market reforms  are expected to provide relief for social transfers.   Nonetheless,  the  expenditure  restraint  of  2004  and   2005  has  been  achieved  partly  by  one-off  measures   that  will  become  a  future   burden  on  the  budget;   moreover,  without  further  structural  measures,  health   care  spending  may  return  to   pre-2004  high  growth   rates. Thus, in order to put  the public finances onto a  sustainable  path,  further   medium-term  consolidation   measures on the expenditure side are needed.  		
April/2005	Estonia	Growth gains momentum while imbalances are starting to diminish 	The situation in 2004  In  2004,  real  GDP  growth  accelerated  to  6.2%.  The   main  driver  of  growth  in   2004  was  net  exports,   supported  by  good  results  in  foreign  tourism  and   buoyant  domestic  demand.  I nvestment  grew  by  over   8%. Construction did particularly well, on the back of  a  housing  boom,  but  has  abated  somewhat  since  last   summer. Credit demand grew by over 30%, mostly in  mortgage  loans  and  business  investment.  The  full- year  HICP  remained  below  expectations  at  3%,  since   low   core   inflation   largely   offset   temporary   EU- accession-related price hikes. The unemployment rate  declined    further,    to    9.2%,    while    employment     continued  to  increase,  albeit  at  a  very  modest  rate  of   just  0.2%.  Following   EU  accession  last  May,  strong   demand  for  Estonian  workers  in  other  EU  countries   has led to shortages of qu alified labour, mainly in the  health  care  sector  but  also   in  construction,  triggering   significant  wage  increases  in  both  sectors.  However,   for  the  economy  as  a  whole,  h igher  inflation  coupled   with  considerable  wage  moderation  led  to  a  slowing   of  real  wage  growth,  whic h  remained  comfortably   below  significant  labour  productivity  gains  of  around   6%. The fiscal position surprised  on the positive side,  with  a  general  government  surplus  of  1.8%  of  GDP.   The external deficit re mained high, at  around 12% of  GDP,  but  recent  trade  data  corrections  finally  appear   to  indicate  an  improvement  of  the  external  account.   Overall, the situation in 200 4 was strongly marked by  various  EU  accession  effec ts,  most  of  which  were   temporary and have already started to abate.   Prospects for 2005 and 2006  Growth  is  forecast  to  remain  around  6%  throughout   the forecast period. One factor that is expected to keep  demand  for  Estonian  expo rts  high  is  the  positive   growth  outlook  for  Estonia’s   main  trading  partners,   Sweden  and  Finl and.  Trade  with   third  countries  is   also   expected   to   accelerate.   With   exports   and    investment  picking  up  stro ngly,  and  the  pace  of  both   private   and   government   consumption   expected   to    expand   slower   than   overall   GDP,   growth   should    become   somewhat   more   balanced.   Investment   is    expected  to  remain  strong ,  fuelled  also  by  public   infrastructure  spending  a nd  smooth  absorption  of  EU   transfers,  co-financing  of  which  is  increasingly  also   provided  by  the  private  sector.  The  methodological   changes  in  recording  required  upon  EU  accession   have  made  the  external  trade  data  temporarily  less   reliable. However, even if  the levels and growth rates  are  uncertain,  recently  revised  trade  data  suggest  that   the  projected  correction  of  the  external  imbalance   may have finally started in 2004. The external deficit  is projected to come down to around 10% of GDP by  2006.  The  trade  balance  is  expected  to  improve  over   the  forecast  period,  while  the   income  balance  will   remain in substantial  deficit. The latter largely reflects  repatriated  profits,  often  in  th e  form  of  reinvested   earnings, roughly two thirds of which come back onto  the   capital   account   as   FDI.   The   capital   account    surplus  is  expected  to  in crease,  not  least  thanks  to   increasing  EU  transfers  which,  along  with  sizeable   FDI   and   portfolio   inflows,   sh ould   help   to   better    balance Estonia’s external account.  Labour market, wages and prices  Strong growth should translate into a renewed pick-up  in employment gains from the modest 2004 rate, and a  sustained  decline  in  the  rate  of  unemployment.  With   regard  to  employment,  some  whitening  of  the  still   widespread  grey  labour  ma rket,  in  particular  in  the   low-wage   sector,   can   be   observed.   This   can   be    attributed  to  a  combination   of  higher  income  tax   thresholds, lower income tax rates, a simple system of  tax    declaration,    and    increasingly    effective    tax     collection.  Also,  region al  disparities  in  the  labour   market as well as youth unemployment are starting to  decline as an active labour market policy starts to bear  fruit. A gradual increase of  presently low participation  rates will be supported by both a rising retirement age  and  stronger  incentives  to  work.  These  trends  are   projected to largely continue over the forecast period.  Given the fairly flexible lab our market, real wages are  expected to increase broadly  in line with  productivity  gains, while 2005  is expected to mark a low for gross  wage  increases,  reflecting  the  cushioning  impact  of   the  income  tax  cuts  on  net  wages.  Consumer  price   inflation   is   expected   to    peak   in   2005   at   3.3%,    reflecting  a  number  of  expec ted  administrative  price   increases,  and  to  return  to  below   3%  in  2006.  Core   inflation  is  fairly  low  and   stable,  and  the  Estonian   authorities  have  expressed  th eir  intention  to  put  a   brake  on  further  administrative  price  hikes  should   inflation develop unfavourably. Oil prices so far have  not   had   a   major   impact   on    inflation   in   Estonia.    Nonetheless, they remain a risk factor to the inflation  forecast. Public finances  In   2004,   Estonia   posted    a   higher-than-projected    general government surplus of  1.8% of GDP, which is  some  1%  above  earlier   projections.  Although  the   Estonian   government   is   aiming   for   a   target   of    balanced  budgets  for  both  2005  and  2006,  prudent   budget  assumptions  and  continuing  improvements  in   tax  collection  are  likely  to  lead   to  surpluses  –  albeit   declining  –  also  in  these   years.  For  2005,  a  strong   carry-over   effect   of   delayed    VAT   tax   collection    related to EU accession can be expected to provide an  additional    boost    to     budgetary    revenues.    Local     government  deficits  have  started  to  come  down,  and   can be expected to further decline as a result of a new  legal framework which will en ter into force in 2006.  		
April/2005	Greece	Olympics' bonus tapers off 	Although  slowing  from  the  previous  year,  economic   growth remained robust in  2004 buttressed  by healthy  domestic   demand.   By   contrast,   the   external   side    continued  to  act  as  a  drag  in  spite  of  a  marked   expansion of export markets, thus confirming that the  Greek industry has a competitiveness problem. In the  year as a whole, real GDP posted an increase of 4.2%,  down  from  4.7%  in  2003.  Following  a  drop  in  the   summer, annual inflation went up again on the back of  higher  oil  prices  and  rising  unit  labour  costs.  The   inflation   differential   with    the   euro-area   average    narrowed somewhat. The assessment of labour market  developments  is  complicated  by  a  major  statistical   revision  carried  out  in  2004.  As  the  data  were  not   revised  backward  by  the  cut-off  date  of  the  forecast,   the  rate  of  unemployment  exhibits  a  break  between   2003   and   2004.   It   is   reported   to   have   increased    significantly  together  with  a  sharp  increase  in  the   labour force ensuing from  the regularisation of illegal  immigrants.   Prospects in 2005 and 2006  The   planned   fiscal   withdrawal   in   2005   and   the    petering  out  of  the  ‘Olympic  bonus’  are  expected  to   shape  the  economic  performance  over  the  forecast   horizon.  GDP  growth  is  likely  to  ease  from  4.2%  in   2004 to slightly below 3% in 2005 before rebounding  somewhat  in  2006   towards  its  potential  rate.  As  a   result,  the  output  gap  is  set  to  narrow  but  to  stay   positive over the forecast period.  In 2005, the planned fiscal  adjustment outlined in the  government   budget   -   mainly   lower   government    investment  and  consumption  expenditure  -  affects   aggregate demand by more than one percentage point.  Although  private  investment  is  expected  to  step  in,   taking  advantage   inter  alia   of  the  recently  approved   business  tax  reform,  total  investment  growth  is  set  to   slow  markedly.  Private  consumption  growth  is  also   projected to weaken, reflecting the dr op in co nfidence  recorded  at  the  end  of  2 004  and  the  onset  of  2005.   However,  the  planned  income   tax  relief  planned  is   likely to mitigate the easing.  The  negative  contribution  fro m  the  external  side  is   expected   to   decline   over   the   forecast   horizon   as    manufacturing  firms  are  likely   to  gain  ground  on  the   still   expanding   export   markets.   Nevertheless,   net    exports  are  likely  to  continue  to  act  as  a  drag  on  real   GDP growth.   Labour market, costs and prices  The healthy pace of economic expansion projected in  2005 and 2006, outpacing  the euro -area average, will  go  along  with  an  increase  in  employment.  However,   in  view  of  the  projected  deceleration  of  economic   growth,   the   rate   of   job   creation,   while   staying    positive,  is  expected  to  dro p  significantly  from  2004,   most   likely   in   the   serv ices   sector.   The   rate   of    unemployment is projected to increase in 2005, before  edging down again in 2006.  Following  a  series  of  gene rous  wage  ag reements  for   the  2004-2005  per iod,  especially  in   the  public  sector,   the leader for other employment categories, wages per  head are set to keep rising at a rate of more than 5% in  2005,  well  above  projected   productivity  growth.  The   trend is expected  to continue in 2006.  Dynamic  wage  developments   coupled  with  strong   domestic   demand   are   projected   to   fuel   inflation,    which   is   projected   to   in crease   to   3.1%   over   the    forecast horizon.  Public finances  Based on the figures reported on 1 March 2005 in the  framework  of  the  EU   budgetary  surveillance,  the   deficit  was  6.1%  of  GDP  in  2004 i   (6.0%  of  GDP   according  to  ESA95  definition  i.e.  excluding  swap- related flows). The new data also  included an upward  revision  of  the  2003  deficit  to  5.2%  of  GDP,  from   4.6%   of   GDP   in   the   Septe mber   2004   reporting,    producing  a  base  effect  into  2004.  Net  of  cyclical   factors, the deficit is estimated  to have been at around  7% of GDP given the large positive output gap.   In  2005,  the  deficit  ratio  is   projected  to  decline  to   4.5%  of  GDP  on  the  back  of  the  fiscal  adjustment   presented     in     the     government     budget.     These      projections do not take account of the additional fiscal  package  announced  by  the  Greek  government  in  late   March, after the cut-off date for the current forecasts.  The  improvement  is  expected  to  chiefly  result  from   lower  investment  expend iture,  which  is  set  to  fall   sharply  from  the  high  levels  brought  about  by  the   organisation of the Olympi c Games, and from a series  of  other  expenditure  curbing  measures.  In  cyclically- adjusted  terms  the  2005  de ficit  is  estimated  to  be   above 5% of GDP.  Following  established   practice,  the  deficit  projection   for  2006  of  4.4%  of  GD P  is  based  on  unchanged   legislation.  The  marginal  improvement  compared  to   2005  reflects  the  moderate  acceleration  of  economic   growth.  The general government debt reached 110.5% of GDP  in  2004,  up  from  109.3%  in   2003  on  the  back  of  a   primary  deficit  and  sizeable  debt  increasing  below- the-line operations. Due to the slowdown in economic  growth  and  the  persistence   of  debt  increasing  stock- flow  adjustments,  the  expected  improvement  of  the   primary   balance   in   2005   will   suffice   to   broadly    stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio.  A slight decline in the  debt ratio is expected in 2006.  		
April/2005	Spain	Widening external imbalances 	Economic develo pments in 2004  GDP  gained  momentum  in  2004  and  grew  by  2.7%,   compared    with    2.5%    in    2003,    following    an     increasingly  unbalanced  growth   pattern,  underpinned   by  dynamic  domestic  demand,  while  the  external   sector continued to weigh  on GDP growth.   Economic   activity   was   led   by   domestic   demand,    which   accelerated   markedly.   Private   consumption    speeded  up,  supported  by  strong  job  creation  along   with  easy  monetary  and  financial  conditions.  These   factors  also  explain  the   resilience  of  investment  in   dwellings,  whereas  the  household  saving  rate  further   decreased  and  net  lending  turned  out  negative  in   2004. Investment in equipment accelerated during the  second  half  of  the  year.  However,  this  acceleration   seems  to  have  been  temporary  and  the  result  of   equipment  renewal  after  a  large  increase  of  profits  in   2003, rather than a consequence of improved business  expectations justifying new  investment projects.  The external sector, especially imports, also exhibited  a high level of dynamism.  Fuelled by strong domestic  demand,  import  growth  accelerated,  while  exports   grew  well  below  world  tr ade.  As  a  result,  the  trade   deficit widened from 5.2% of  GDP in 2003 to 6.8% in  2004. The external sector deducted 1.7 pp from GDP  growth, compared with 0.8 pp. in the previous year.   The  negative  contribution  of  the  external  sector  to   growth  has  its  origin  in  a  persistent  and  widening   deficit in goods trade, which  results from high import  growth,  underpinned  by  dynamic  domestic  demand,   while positive inflation differen tials with the euro area  and low productivity growth kept exports growth well  below imports.  Prospects for 2005 and 2006  GDP  growth  in  2005  is   projected  to  remain  almost   unchanged  at  2.7%,  on  the  basis  of  still  buoyant   domestic    demand    which    will    decelerate    only     marginally.    This    will    translate    into    a    slight     deceleration of imports and therefore a somewhat less  unbalanced growth pattern  than in 2004.   Domestic   demand   will   be   underpinned   by   still    dynamic job creation and eas y monetary and financial  conditions.   The   deceleration   of   domestic   demand    stems    from    a    slight    moderation    of    private     consumption.  Households’  i ndebtedness  is  projected   to keep on growing, while high inflationary pressures  and  the  worsening  of  the  terms  of  trade  may  also   negatively affect consumers’  purchasing power. Gross  fixed   capital   formation   sh ould   remain   buoyant,    backed by investment in dwellings, which is expected  to  exhibit  strong  growth.  However,  investment  in   equipment  is  projected  to  decelerate  since  the  factors   underpinning  the  2004  recovery  of  this  item  seem  to   have faded out in 2005.  This  strong  final  demand  is  expected  to  keep  import   growth well above exports. The latter are projected to  grow only moderately due to sl uggish prospects in the  euro    area    coupled     with    deteriorating    industrial     competitiveness.  The  extern al  sector  is  projected  to   negatively contribute to GDP growth by 1.4 pp.  The year 2006 is expected to  record a broadly similar  growth  profile.  GDP  is  projected  to  grow  at  2.7%.   Domestic demand components are expected to further  decelerate.  The  slowdown  of  private  consumption   should  not  be  strong  and,   consequently  household   indebtedness should conti nue to widen. The still large  gap  between  production  and  demand  in  the  housing   market  should  induce  a  reduction  of  growth  in  the   construction   sector.   Investme nt   in   equipment   will    remain subdued, reflecting bu sinesses  concerns  about   the medium term.  The  projected  deceleration  of  domestic  demand  will   lead   to   a   moderation   of   imports,   but,   persistent    competitiveness  losses,  coupled   with  expectations  of   sluggish  growth  in  Spain’s   main  EU  trade  partners,   will   still   weigh   on   export   growth.   Overall,   the    negative  contribution  from  the  external  sector,  albeit   smaller  in  absolute  terms,  is   expected  to  lighten  only   marginally, to 1.1 pp.  The trade deficit is expected to reach 7.7% of GDP in  2005 and to further increase to 8.3% of GDP in 2006.  Additionally,    the    surp lus    recorded    by    services,     especially  tourism,  which  ha s  traditionally  offset  the   deficit   in   goods   trade,   narr owed   in   2004   and   is    projected   to   stagnate   over   the   forecast   period.    However,  the  increasing  presence  of  Spanish  firms   overseas   will   increase   primary   incomes,   helping    compensate   the   trade   deficit.   Overall,   the   current    account  deficit  could  attain  6.2%  of  GDP  in  2006.   This     current     account     figures,     only     slightly      compensated by net capital tr ansactions, sh ould result  in  a  net  borrowing  position  of  the  economy  of  4.7%   and  5.2%  of  GDP  in  20 05  and  2006  compared  to   3.9% in 2004.   Labour market   Job  creation  will  remain  robust.  In  2005,  full  time   equivalent  employment  is   expected  to  grow  at  2.1%,   whereas  in  2006  it  should  decelerate  to  2%  in  line   with somewhat less dynamic economic activity.  Job  creation  is  expected  to  concentrate  on  sectors   where  productivity  is  low,   namely  construction  and   services.  In  the  manufacturing  sector,  employment  is   projected  to  recover  only  ma rginally  (0.1%   in  2005   and  0.2%  in  2006),  wh ich  compares  with  the  job   losses  recorded  ov er  2002-2004.  St rong  job  creation   will take place along with  a rising activity rate, which  would reach 70% at the end of the forecasting period.  The  increase  of  the  activity  rate   is  mainly  explained   by   high   immigration   flows   and   higher   female    participation.  As  a  consequence,  the  unemployment   rate  would  reduce  only  marginally  over  the  forecast   period, remaining still above 10% in 2006.  Productivity  is  proj ected  to  grow  over  the  forecast   period  by  a  meagre  0.6%  per  year,  mainly  reflecting   the   existence   of   rigidities    in    product    markets,     especially   utilities   and   services.    However,   in   the    manufacturing   sector,   productivity   growth   should    remain  stronger  at  around  2% ,  mirroring  the  higher   exposition   to   competition   of    this   sector,   but   still    below  the  euro-area  average.  In  contrast,  in  the  non- manufacturing   sector,   productivity   is   expected   to    almost  stagnate,  growing  only   by  0.3%  in  2005  and   0.4% in 2006.  Costs and prices  Following  the  oil  price  hike   in  the  second  and  third   quarters  of  2004  and  negative  behaviour  of  food   components,  headline  inflation  reached  3.1%,  while   core inflation was only slightly lower at 2.8%. Since  the  increase  in  energy  prices  is  expected  to   affect the first months of the current year, inflation is  projected to ease gradually after the second quarter of  2005. On an annual ba sis, HICP inflation is expected  to ease to 2.9% in 2005, and  to fall further to 2.7% in  2006.     Structural     factors     such     as     insufficient      competition  in  certain  sectors  (utilities  and  services),   coupled   with   remaining    rigidities   in   the   labour    market,  especially  indexation  clauses,  seem  to  be   behind  the  still  high  inflationary  pressures.  The  GDP   deflator  is  projected  to  grow  well  above  the  HICP,   mainly  due  to  a  high  const ruction  deflator  and  the   relative  moderation  of  import  prices  compared  to   domestic production.    Following    resilient    inflatio n,    compensation    of     employees  per  head  is  projected  to  decelerate  only   marginally  growing  at  around  3.7%  over  the  forecast   period.   This   may   partially   reflect   the   effect   of    indexation  clauses,  while  social  partners  seem  to  be   committed  to  wage  moderation.  Consequently,  unit   labour  costs  are  expected  to   slightly  slow  down  in   2005 and 2006 compared wi th 2004. A lthough labour  costs  in  Spain  will  still   grow  above  the  euro-area   average,   they   will   continue   to   grow   below   GDP    deflator,  which  results  in  neg ative  real  unit  labour   costs growth over the forecast period.  Coupled   with   low    productivity   growth,   inflation    differentials   with   the   main    trading   partners   will    continue   being   one   of   the   driving   forces   behind    widening external deficits.  Public finances  In  2004,  the  budget  deficit   was  0.3%  of  GDP.  The   inclusion  of  RENFE  (the  Spanish  railway  company)   and  RTVE  (the  public  broadcasting  company)  in  the   general  government  sector  was  initially  projected  to   lead  to  a  deficit  close  to   0.8%  of  GDP,  but  the   budgetary effects of this reclassification were partially  offset    by    higher-than-expe cted    revenues.    Public     consumption     expend iture     contributed     to     the      dynamism   of   domestic   demand,   by   growing   in    nominal   terms   (9.9%)   well   above   nominal   GDP    (7.2%).   A balanced budget is projected for 2005, while a non- policy-change scenario would resu lt in a small surplus  (0.1% of GDP) for 2006 . Strong job creation coupled  with   dynamic   consumption   should   keep   revenues    growing   above   nominal   GDP.   As   a   result,   total    revenues  are  projected  to  reach  40.4%  of  GDP  in   2005  and  40.5%  in  2006,  0.5  percentage  points  of   GDP above the government target. In parallel, led by  strong  public  consumption   growth,  expenditures  are   projected at 40.4% of GDP in 2005 and 2006. This is  around  0.6  percentage  points  of  GDP  higher  than  the   government   projection,   wh ich   might   be   slightly    optimistic.  The  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  expected  to  continue  on  a   declining path during the fo recast period, falling from  48.9%  of  GDP  in  2004  to  around  44%  of  GDP  in   2006. 		
April/2005	France	Growth remains robust, fuelled by domestic demand 	The economic situation in 2004  Real  GDP  in  France  grew  by   2.5%  in  2004,  its  best   performance   since   2000.   Contrary   to   what   was    observed  in  the  euro  area  as  a  whole,  the  French   economy    was    supported    by    domestic    demand,     especially  by  private  consumption.  At  the  same  time,   the contribution of th e external sector to GDP growth  was   negative   since   France   could   not   fully   take    advantage of the expansion of world trade because its  export  markets  expanded  more  slowly  and  its  price   competitiveness deteriorated.   The strong average growth figure hides a slowdown in  the second half of 2004. While  in the first ha lf of 2004  real  GDP  growth  reached  about  3%  in  annualised   terms,  it  fell  below  its  potent ial  in  the  second  half  of   the  year.  In  particular,  in  the  context  of  a  worsening   demand  outlook  linked   to  the  oil  price  increase  and   the  cumulated  euro  appreciation,  business  investment   was  less  buoyant  in  the   second  half  of  the  year.   Consumer  spending,  which  grew  rapidly  in  the  first   half of 2004, dipped in the third quarter but rebounded  strongly   in   the   fourth    quarter.   The   end   of   tax    exemption  (in  December  2004)  on  the  withdrawal  of   balances  held  by  employees   in  companies’  savings   schemes might have encouraged households to free up  some   savings.   In   the   context   of   the   protracted    weakness  of  gross  disposable  household  income,  the   buoyant  private  consumption  was  driven  by  a  large   decline in the saving ratio  (by 0.7 pp in 2004).  Prospects for 2005 and 2006  In  2005,  real  GDP   growth  is  expected   to  slow  down   somewhat  and  in  2006  it  is   projected  to   return  to  its   potential.  Economic  activ ity  should  still  be  driven  by   domestic   demand,   while   the   contribution   of   net    exports to GDP growth should tu rn neutral by the end  of the forecast period.  Recent    macroeconomic    indicators    suggest    that     economic  activity  is  likely  to   continue  to  be  buoyant   in  the  first  quarter  of  2005,  supported  by  private   consumption, while employme nt growth may be slow  to  pick  up  (unchanged  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004   after  a  slight  increase  of  0.1%  in  the  third  quarter).   Also,  consumers  should  continue  to  draw  on  their   savings  but  this  may  not  be  sustainable  since  the   savings  ratio  is  already  1   point  below  its  long-term   average.   Overall   private   consumption   growth   is    projected to decelerate from 2.3% in 2004 to 2.0% in  2005.  In  2006,   private  consumpti on  is  expected  to   remain the main driving force of growth, based on an  expected   substantial   recovery   in   employment.   It    would  increase  in  line  with  disposable  household   income,  which  is  foreseen  to  accelerate  gradually   thanks  to  a  rise  in  demand  for  labour.  Over  the   forecast  horizon,  the  planned  reform  of  the  35-hour   working week may boost households’ income through  an  increase  in  authorised  annual   overtime  and  the   possibility for employees to  convert the allowed extra  overtime   into   additional   in come.   The   decline   in    inflation should also strengthen the purchasing power  of households.  Over  the  next  two  years,  invest ment  in  equipment  is   forecast to remain relatively buoyant. It should still be  supported  by  favourab le  financing  co nditions  and  the   implementation    of    tax    cuts    on    new    capital     expenditure. But in 2005, th e deterioration in demand expectations,  uncertainty  about  the  sustainability  of   the  consumption  growth   and  relatively  low  capacity   utilisation    are    expected    to    curb    spending    on     equipment  in  the  near  term .  In  2006,  this  tendency   would  be  reversed.  Hence,  following  a  deceleration   from  5.1%  in  2004  to  4.5%  in  2005,  equipment   investment  growth  wo uld  pick  up  in  2006  (to  5.5%).   The  increase  in  residential  construction  investment  is   also forecast to moderate from 2.9% in 2004 to about  2% in 2005 and 2006.  After  a  loss  in  export  market  shares  in  2004  for  the   second    consecutive    year,    export    volumes    are     projected   to   increase   more   in   line   with   markets’    growth.  The  improvement  of  price  competitiveness   and  a  better  cyclical  position  in  those  sectors  (car   transport  and  aeronautic  sector s)  in  which  France  is   specialised   should   support   export   growth.   In   this    context,  and  although  imports  are  forecast  to  remain   buoyant in response to the robustness of final demand,  the  negative  contributio n  of  net  trade  to  GDP  growth   will diminish.  Labour markets, costs and prices  The  need  for  companies  to  further  improve  their   financial    situation,    uncertainties    concerning    the     durability   of   the   recovery    and   the   lag   in   the    employment response to a pick  up in activity in 2004  largely  explain  the  current  weakness  in  employment   growth. In 2005 and 2006,  employment growth is set  to   strengthen   in   response    to   improved   corporate    profitability  and  better  economic  prospects  over  the   forecast  horizon.  This  would  allow  a  decline  in  the   unemployment rate, from 9.6% of the labour force in  2004 to 9.1% in  2006 (ILO definition).  Given   the   still   high    unemployment   rate,   wage    increases   are   expected   to   be   moderate   in   2005.    Nevertheless, the harmonisation of the different levels  of  the  minimum  wage,  induced  by  the  reduction  in   working time to 35 hours implemented between 1998  and  2002,  will  still  support  wag es  in  2005.  In  both   2005  and  2006  the  p lanned  increased  flexibility  of   working  time  should  also  sustain  wages.  A  slight   cyclical  acceleration  in  real  wages  is  expected  to   occur  in  2006,  driven  by  the  improvement  of  the   situation in the labour market.  With productivity growth expected to decelerate from  the  high  rate  observed  in   2004,  unit  labour  costs   should   rise   over   the   forecast   period.   Underlying    inflation  is  therefore  projected  to  pick  up  gradually,   especially   in   the   services   sector.   However,   the    government’s    initiative    to    induce    retailers    and     consumer  goods  producers  to   cut  the  prices  of  major   branded  products,  reinforced   by  the  planned  revision   of the Galland Law on retail pricing, should moderate  inflation.  In  add ition,  the  diminishing  effect  of  past   increases  in  excise  duties  on  tobacco  should  reduce   the  inflation  rate  by  0.4  percentag e  point  in  2005.  In   2006,  the  expected  decrease  in  energy  prices  should   contribute to a decline in HICP inflation.   Public finances  The general government deficit declined from 4.2% of  GDP  in  2003  to  3.7%  of   GDP  in  2004.   This  decline   benefited from an improvement in the macroeconomic  situation,  which  triggered   additional  fiscal  revenues,   notably  in  terms  of  VAT  and  income  tax,  of  about   0.7%   of   GDP   compared   to   initial   budget   plans.    Discretionary  tax  measures  contributed  to  a  deficit   reduction by about 0.1%  of GDP. The ratio of general  government expenditure to GDP declined from 54.7%  in  2003  to  54.5%  of  GDP  in   2004.  While  for  the   second  year  in  a  row  State  expenditure  remained   stable  in  volume  as  planned,  expenditures  in  social   security  regimes  and  local  authorities  increased  by   more than initially foreseen  by the French  authorities.  All  in  all,  the  cyclically-adjusted   deficit  improved  by   0.4  percentage  point  of  GDP  in  2004,  as  against  a   targeted  0.8  percentage  point  of  GDP.  The  general   government  debt  continued  to  increase,  from  63.9%   of GDP in 2003 to 65.6%  of GDP in 2004, as a result  of the deficit and negative stock-flow adjustments.   For  2005,  the  general   government  deficit  is  projected   at  3%.  The  current  forecast  assumes  that  expenditure   will  increase  by  2%  in  real  terms  (compared  to  the   1.6% increase foreseen by the national authorities) as  health expenditures are projected to increase by 4.0%  in 2005 against 3.2% in  the budget law fo r 2005. This  is  due  to  an  assumed  lower  impact  of  the  measures   introduced  by  the  health  reform.  The  forecast  also   incorporates   one-off   payments   by   the   EDF/GDF    companies   to   the   general   government   for   a   total    amount  of  0.5%  of  GDP  related  to  this  transfer.  This   is the same deficit estimate as in the autumn forecast,  when 2005 real GDP growth was projected at 2.2% as  against  2%  currently  expected.  The  negative  growth   effect  on  the  deficit  (0.1  percentage  point  of  GDP)  is   compensated  by  some  measures  on  the  revenue  side.  The  macroeconomic  and  bu dgetary  forecast  for  2005   is  consistent  with  an  impr ovement  in  the  cyclically- adjusted balance by 0.8 percentage point of GDP, the  largest part of which reflects the impact of the one-off  measures.  The  overall  budgetary  situation  in  France   remains  vulnerable  and  the   2005  government  deficit   forecast  is  subject  to  upward  risks.  In  particular,   beyond      the      expenditure      slippages      already       incorporated  in  the  current  forecast,  further  slippages   cannot  be  ruled  out,  notably   in  the  health  and  local   authorities  sectors.  In  addition,  this  forecast  does  not   include  potential  further  increases  in  public  sector   wages  (on  top  of  the  alre ady  granted  two  index   revalorisations    of    0.5%    each)    linked    to    the     negotiations  starting  end  of  March  2005.  It  also  does   not    include    possible     tax    cuts    following    the     announcement  by  the  government  on  8  February.   These  potential  effects  may  to  a  certain  extent  be   compensated    by    additi onal    non-fiscal    revenues     stemming from debt buy-back operations from foreign  States. In  2006,  despite  real  GDP  growth  being  expected  to   be  close  to  its  potential  rate,  the  general  government   deficit  is  projected  to  in crease  again  to  3.4%  of  GDP   (based  on  the  usual  no-policy-change  assumption).   This  reflects  the  fact  that  the  exceptional  payments   contributing  to  the  deficit   reduction  in  2005  will   vanish  in  2006  and  that  tax  cuts  are  already  planned   for that year (0.2% of GDP). This projection is based  on  the  assumption  that  real  government  expenditures   will  increase  by  about  2%  in  real  terms,  compared   with  a  projection  of  1.2%  in  the  latest  update  of  the   stability  programme.  The  risk s  to  the  government   deficit forecast for 2006 are skewed to the upside.  		
April/2005	Ireland	Adjusting to sustainable growth levels 	The economy in 2004  Real  GDP  is  estimated  to  have  grown  by  5.4%  in   2004,   representing    a   significant   pick    up   on   the    previous   year   (3.7%),   w ith   most   of   the   apparent    acceleration  coming  from  higher  net  exports.  On  the   domestic  side,  overall  expend iture  grew  at  a  similar   rate  to  the  previous  y ear.  While  consumer  demand   remained  relatively  muted  by  past  standards  (with   growth  estimated  at  just  below  3%  on  the  year),   investment   was   stronger.   In    particular,   residential    building  contributed  sign ificantly  to  overall  growth,   although   the   activ ity   in   this   segment   moderated    somewhat  in  the  third   quarter.  On  the  external  side,   figures for the first three quarters suggest a somewhat  weaker   than   previously   expected   performance   of    merchandise  expor ts,  though  performance  of  services   offset this somewhat. However, imports are estimated  to have grown well below exp ectations, resulting in a  significantly stronger contri bution from net exports as  compared to 2003. Indicators for the fourth quarter of  2004    suggest    some    easing    of    sentiment    in     construction  and  industry.   On  the  other  hand,  the   latest purchasing manager’s  indices for services point  to increased activity in recent months.   Prospects for 2005 and 2006  GDP is projected to grow by 4.9% and 5.1% in 2005  and 2006 respectively, in lin e with estimated medium- term    potential.    On    the    domestic    side,    private     consumption   is   supported   in to   2005   by   healthy    employment growth and, in line with recent evidence,  also  by  somewhat  stronger  consumer  confidence.  In   2006,  private  spending   will  revive  somewhat  further,   benefiting  from  a  modest  fa ll  in  the  savings  rate  as   some  Special  Savings  Incentive  Accounts   (SSIAs) reach  maturity.  By  contrast,  the  contribution  from   public consumption should re main modest in view of  further  spending  restraint.  Also  the  growth  of  fixed   investment   should   moderate   over   the   projection    period.   Some   easing    in   construction   activity   is    foreseen,  mainly  as  housing   output  is  expected  to   taper  off  somewhat  after  reach ing  record  levels  in   2004. However, a pick-up in investment in equipment  and   non-residential   construction   over   the   forecast    horizon,  supported  by  acceleration  in  public  capital   expenditure  and  continued  inward  foreign  investment   (FDI),  is  likely  to  offset  this  to   some  extent.  On  the   external   side,   trends   in    oil   prices,   international    economic  activity  and  the  euro /dollar  exchange  rate   are the key medium-term risks for the Irish economy.  Building on the momentum  regained in 2004, service  exports are expected to sustain more dynamic growth  rates  over  the  forecast  period.  As  net  profit  outflows   are  projected  to  remain  on  their  recent  upward  trend,   the  projected  growth  rate  of  GNI  is  somewhat  lower   than that of GDP.  Labour market, costs and prices  In 2004 employment is estimated to have grown by a  remarkable  3.0%.  However,  in  view  of  a  gradual   easing  back  of  construction  output  and  the  cap  on   public  sector  employment,  em ployment  gains  will  be   somewhat  weaker  in  2005  and  2006.  Nevertheless,   with  a  similar  rate  of  exp ansion  proj ected  for  the   labour force, unemployment is estimated to remain at  around  4½%  over  the  forecast  period,  implying  still   fairly tight labour market conditions. Data for the first  three quarters of 2004 suggest a slight acceleration in  per   capita   compensation,   now   estimated   to   have    grown   just   above   5½%   in   2004,   reflecting   the    relatively  tight  labour  market  conditions.  However,   some  easing  of  wage  growth  is  projected  in  view  of   the moderate pay provisions in the second half of the  national agreement “Sustai ning Progress” and a lower  contribution from benchmarking pay awards to public  sector  employees  (i.e.  the  alignment  of  public  sector   wages   with   the   private   sector   equivalent).   HICP    inflation  averaged  2.3%  in  2004,  down  from  4.0%  in   2003.  With  downward  pressures  stemming  from  a   stronger currency and no changes in the main indirect  taxes, the annual rate is projected to moderate further  in  2005.  However,  as  private  spending  revives  into   2006,  HICP  inflation  is  expected  to  rise  gradually,  to  just  below  2½%  by  the  end  of  2006.  CPI  inflation  is   expected  to  be  slightly  above  that  of  the  HICP  over   the forecast period.   Public finances  For  2004,  the  general  gov ernment  surplus  was  1.3%   of  GDP.  This  favourable  outtu rn  is  due  to  higher- than-expected   tax   receipts   and   also   lower-than- budgeted     expenditures,     especially     on     public      investment.   For   2005   the   main   measures   on   the    revenue   side   of   the   budget   include   an   upward    adjustment  of  the  standard  tax  band  for  personal   income  and  some  relief  th rough  changes  in  stamp   duty.   The   expenditure   side   includes   significant    increases  in  both  current  and  capital  spending.  The   general  government  position  is   thus  expected  to  turn   into a deficit of 0.6 % of GDP. Nevertheless, there are  some   risks   to   this   projection.   In   particular,   no    allowance is made for the  as yet unclear implications  for public finances of a recent court ruling on nursing  home  payments.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  also   some  risks  that  the  general  government  deficit  might   turn out lower that project ed, including stronger-than- expected       receipts       from       special       Revenue        Commissioners   investigations   in   2005   and   some    under-spending   in   cap ital   outlays.   The   deficit   is    projected  at  0.6%  of  GDP   in  2006.  Given  the  non- indexed  nature  of  the  tax  and  social  benefit  system,   the  no-policy  change  assump tion  is  made  operational   for  2006  by  freezing  average  tax  rates  and  adjusting   social   transfer   payments   by   the   forecast   of   CPI    inflation  (with  a  small  top-up).  Government  debt  is   projected to stabilise just below 30% of GDP. 		
April/2005	Italy	Recovery carries on at measured pace 	scheme  to  increase  the  tax  base  of  self-employed   people  ( studi  di  settore )  and  (iii)  expenditure  cuts   introduced  on  top  of  the  already  very  ambitious  2%   cap  on  the  annual  nominal  increase  foreseen  in  the   original version of the budget. Then, the Commission  services scenario assumes an increase in real GDP of  1.2%,  as  compared  to  2.1%   in  the  latest  available   official  projection,  and  takes  into  account  that  the   2004   deficit   turned   out   sl ightly   higher   than   the    targeted  2.9%  of  GDP.  Furthermore,  the  budgetary   position   in   2005   could    be   affected   by   pending    renewals of public wage agre ements and receipts from  real  estate  disposals  that  could  be  lower  than  the   officially   estimated   0.5%   of   GDP,   to   which   the    Commission forecast is aligned.  The  forecast  for  2006  of  a  deficit  of  4.6%  of  GDP   reflects  the  expiry  of  one-off  measures,  and  is  based   on  legislation  currently  in  force.  The  debt  ratio  is   expected to decline margin ally in 2005 and to increase  in   2006,   to   return   to   th e   2003   level.   Following    indications  of  the  2004   updated  stability  programme,   privatisation receipts of around  2 percentage points of  GDP  per  year  are  projected  to  be  entirely  offset  by   debt  increasing  below-the-l ine  operations.  As  for  the   deficit,   the   debt   forecast   for   2006   is   based   on    legislation currently in force. The situation in 2004   Following  two  years  of  near  stagnation,  reflecting   both   a   cyclical   slowdown   in   the   euro-area   and    structural problems specific to Italy, economic growth  accelerated  somewhat  in  2004  reaching  an  average   rate   of   1.2%.   In   spite   of   the   improvement,   the    recovery shows at least three weak spots. First, it only  gained  ground  when  th e  global  cycle  is  losing  some   momentum.  Second,  the  driving  forces  of  economic   growth  proved  unsteady.  In  particular,  the  healthy   performance  of  domestic  demand  in  the  first  quarter   of the year was followed by a marked and unexpected  frailty   later   on   offset   by   a   temporary   revival   of    exports  of  goods  and   services  at  around  mid-year.   Third,  quarterly  GDP  growth  turned  unexpectedly   negative in the final quarter of the year.   Head-count  employment,  wh ich  had  held  up  well   during the previous  years of feeble economic growth,  slowed in 2004 reflecting several factors including the  traditional    lag    to    economic     activity,    a    cut    in     employment  subsidies  and  the  petering  out  of  the   level  effect  of  past  labour  market  reforms.  On  the   back  of  the  stro ng  euro  and  a  tem porary  drop  in  oil   prices,  consumer  price  inflation  eventually  embarked   on  a  downward  trend  towards  year-end,  closing  the   gap  vis-à-vis  the  euro-area  average.  In  the  year  as  a   whole HICP inflation was 2.3%.  Prospects in 2005  and 2006   Against   the   background   of   a   still   buoyant   yet    somewhat        cooling        in ternational        economic         environment,   the   Italian   economy   is   expected   to    rebound  from  the  negative  performance  recorded  at   the  end  of  2004  and  to  move  along  an  upward  path   throughout   2005   and   2006.   However,   growth   is    expected   to   remain   moderate,   reflecting   both   the    persistence   of   structural   rigidities   and   temporary    factors  such  as  high  oil  pri ces.  Real  GDP  growth  is   forecast  to  stay  at  1.2%  in  2005  before  edging  up  to   1.7% the year after. As a result, Italy would continue  to lag behind the euro average.  In spite of the volatility exh ibited in the recent past, a  number   of   favourable   fundam entals   suggests   that    economic  growth  will  mainly  be  driven  by  domestic   demand. In particular, private consumption is likely to  steady  and  strengthen  again  in   view  of  ongoing  job   creation  and  rising  real  di sposable  income.  A  more   robust  performance  of  the  largest  domestic  demand   component is likely to be  hampered by the uncertainty  surrounding  the  future  cour se  of  fiscal  policy  in  the   light    of    the    current    bu dgetary    imbalances    in     combination with the still very high government debt- to-GDP  ratio.  Gross  fixed   capital  formation  is  also   expected to contribute to  economic growth helped by  low real interest rates, rising prof it margins and, more  generally, the gradually improving growth outlook. A  further  extension  to  the  end  of  2005  of  a  fiscal   incentive for renovating  private dwellings is expected  to continue supporting  investment in  construction.   Following  the  pattern  of  the  past  several  years,  the   unfavourable   product   speci alisation   towards   low- growth    goods    coupled    with    a    loss    of    cost     competitiveness hinders Italy to  fully benefit from the  still robust expansion of worl d trade. Hence, despite a  recovery   of   foreign   sales,   th e   external   side   is    projected   to   continu e   weighing   on   overall   GDP   growth throughout the forecast period.  Labour market, costs and prices  The  moderate  economic  recovery  is  expected  to  go   along   with   ongoing   j ob   creation   over   the   entire    forecast     horizon     also     reflecting     the     positive      adjustment effects from  the successive steps of labour  market   reform   implemented   since   the   mid-1990s.    However,   the   job   content    of   growth   is   likely   to    decline  from  the  exceptionally  high  level  observed   over  the  past  several  years.  The  main  contribution  to   overall  employment  growth  will  continue  to  come   from services. As a result of  the positive performance  of  the  labour  market,  the  rate  of  unemployment  is   expected to continue its downward trend.  To  the  extent  that  over  the  past  several  years  fiscal   incentives  have  con tributed  to  resilient  employment   growth   in   the   South    of   the   country,   the   cuts    implemented  in  the  2004  budget  are  likely  to  affect   the convergence process. Hopes are now pinned to the  possibility  to  increase  the  still  low  degree  of  wage   differentiation     to     account     for     differences     in      productivity. Discussions about ways of reforming the  current  system  of  wage  bargain ing  are  still  ongoing.   Recent  wage  negotiations  have  led  to  an  acceleration   of country-wide contractual wages, which for the first  time  in  more  than   four  years  increased  more  than   inflation. With around half  of  the  wage  contracts  due   to   be   renegotiated   in    2005   these   developments    represent  a  challenging  point   of  departure.  On  the   other  hand,  as  the  outlook  for  inflation  seems  benign   over the forecast horizon – both consumers and firms  expect  a  slowdown  in  the  coming  months  –  the   upcoming   wage   agreements   are   forecast   not   to    permanently fuel wage inflation.   Concerning    the    response    of    inflation    to    wage     developments,  the  projected  economic  recovery  will   dampen  unit  labour  costs  in   2006.  In  addition,  the   closing  but  still  negative   output  gap  will  also  be   conducive   to   lower   inflation.   Overall,   the   annual    increase  in  HICP  inflation  is  forecast  to  gradually   decline below 2 percent over the forecast horizon.  Public finances  The   first   reporting   by    the   Italian   authorities   of    government  deficit  and  debt  levels  for  2005  included   significant  upward  revisi ons  of  the  deficit-to-GDP   ratio in 2001-2003 in the order of 0.4 of a percentage  point  on  average.  The  2004  deficit  is  reported  at  3%   of  GDP i ,  one  decimal  point  of  GDP  higher  than  in   2003. With interest expenditure  declining by 0.3% of  GDP,  the  drop  in  the  primar y surplus was even more  severe:  it  fell  at  2%  of  GDP,  the  lowest  level  since   1992.   In   cyclically   adjusted   terms,   the   general    government  deficit  improved  by  0.2  of  a  percentage   point  of  GDP.  The  primary  surplus  worsened  of  one   decimal    point    of    GDP.    Nevertheless,    one-offs     continued  to  improve  the  2004  deficit  by  around  1½   percentage  points  of  GDP,  do wn  from  around  2%  in   2003.  The  government  debt  ratio  declined  to  105.8%  of   GDP  in  2004  from  106.3%  in  2003.  Debt  increasing   below-the-line   operations   continued   to   hamper   a    faster   reduction   of   the   debt-to-GDP   ratio.   The    negative  impact  of  these  operations  more  than  offset   the positive effect from the  privatisation of 20% of the  formerly  state-owned  electricity  company,  ENEL,  in   October, which raised 0.5% of GDP.  In  2005,  in  the  absence   of  additional  measures,  the   general  government  deficit  is  forecast  to  increase  to   3.6%  of  GDP ii .  Although  interest  expenditures  are   likely  to  continue  dimin ishing  relative  to  GDP,  the   primary  surplus  is  expected  to  further  drop  to  around   1.3% of GDP. Net of cycli cal factors, both the deficit  and  the  primary  balance  are  projected  to  worsen  by   around ½ of a percentage point of GDP. However, the  impact  of  temporary  measures  is  expected  to  decline   to ¾ of a percentage point of GDP.  The   Commission   services   forecast   is   significantly    above the official deficit target of 2.7% of GDP for a  number   of   reasons.   First,   as   in   its   2004   autumn    forecast, the Commission services assume that ANAS,  the  joint-stock  compan y  in  charge  of  the  state  road   network,    continues    to    be    part    of    the    general     government sector, whereas in the government figures  it  is  classified  as  a  market  company.  Second,  the   forecast   has   a   more   prudent   assessment   of   some    measures  included  in  the  2005   budget.  Compared  to   the   original   draft   underpinning   the   Commission    services   2004   autumn   fo recast,   the   2005   budget    approved by Parliament in December includes further  expenditures  and  tax  cuts.  The  planned  financing  of   these  additional  measures  is  assessed  to  fall  short  of   the   officially   estimated   effect.   This   particularly    concerns  (i)  part  of  the  savings  expected  from  local   governments,  (ii)  the  im plementation  of  the  revised  		
April/2005	Cyprus	Strengthening growth with fiscal consolidation well on track 	The economy in 2004  Following  a  pick-up  of  econo mic  activity  in  the  2 nd half  of  2003,  GDP  growth  strengthened  further  in   2004,  reaching  3.7%  for  the  year.  The  recovery  was   driven  by  domestic  demand  growth,  especially  in   private  consumption  and  investment  in  construction   and  machinery.  Governmen t  consumption  dropped  in   real  terms.  Private  consumption  growth  rebounded  to   6.1%,  in  line  with  the  increase  in  disposable  income   and  was  further  stimulated,   inter  alia ,  by  restrained   demand for consumer durable goods in previous years  and  certain  elements  of  the   tax  reform  including  the   lowering  of  excise  duties  on  cars.  After  a  decline  in   2003,  investment  also  picked   up  strongly  with  an   estimated   increase   of   more   than   9%,   reflecting    improved   profitability   and   more   positive   investor    expectations. Therefore, the interest rate hike on April  30,  related  to  political  uncertainties  regarding  the   reunification  process  as  well  as  the  final  stage  of   liberalisation  of  capital  movement  restrictions  at  the   date of EU accession, did not seem to have negatively  affected      private      domestic      demand.      Fiscal       consolidation  led  to  a  st rong  decline  in  government   consumption which contri buted to a marked reduction  in the general government deficit.   Net    external    demand    contributed    negatively    to     growth.  After  declining  in  the  previous  two  years,   exports of goods and services in 2004 staged a modest  recovery.  Tourism  arrivals  increased  by  2%,  the  first   positive  growth  since  2001   but  still  below  historical   growth  rates.  However,  im ports  surged,  especially  of   cars, as a result of the expansion in domestic demand  and  lower  excise  duties  on  cars.  Together  with  rising   oil  prises,  these  factors  led  to  a  significant  widening   of the current account deficit to an estimated 5.7% of  GDP.  Prospects for 2005 and 2006  The outlook for this year and 2006 is for some further  strengthening  of  GDP  growth   to  around  4%.  This  is   mainly   domestic-demand   led,   linked   to   continued    strong   private   sector   in vestment   and   consumption    growth  in  an  environment  of  improving  investor  and   consumer    confidence.    Consumption    growth    is     supported by rises in disposable income as real wages  increase  in  line  with  productivity  development  in   near-full    employment     conditions.    An    increased     competitive environment following EU accession and  positive      investment      conditions      provided      by       liberalisation in financial and utilities markets and the  positive  outlook  on  further  fiscal  consolidation  are   expected  to  continue  to  s timulate  further  investment   expansion.  At the same time , the growth contribution  from external demand is expected  to turn positive for  both  years.  Mainly  based  on  the  moderately  positive   EU growth outlook, the  forecast projects a continuing  modest  recovery  in  export   growth  in  2005-2006,  in   tourism  and  even  more   in  non-tourist  services.  As   one-off  demand  factors  fade  out,  import  growth  is   expected  to  slow  in  2005   and  then  pick  up  with   domestic  demand  growth  in   2006.  All  in  all,  the   forecast  projects  a  concomitant  modest  decline  in  the   current  account  deficit  to  belo w  5%  of  GDP  for  this   year  and  4.5%  of  GDP  in  2006.  However,  projected   trade  developments,  especially  in  tourism  and  oil   prices, remain fraught with uncertainty.  Labour market, costs and prices  Unemployment  rose  somewhat  to  5%  in  2004  but  is   expected   to   inch   downward   as   growth   picks   up    further. The (limited) border opening with the Turkish  Cypriot (T/C) community has led to an increase of the  share   of   daily   commu ting   T/C   workers   in   total    employed  labour  to  about  1%.  The  contribution  of   foreign workers on the on e hand and wage moderation  in  the  public  secto r  on  the  other  seem  to  exercise  a   moderating pressure on wages, which are expected to  increase    between  1.5  and  2%  in  real  terms  in  2005   and   2006,   below   expected   productivity   growth.    Inflation  fell  back  to  1.9%  in   2004  after  peaking  at   4%  in  2003  when  it  was  pushed  up  by  increases  in   VAT  rates  and  excise  duties.   Notwithstanding  the   projected  growth  rebound  from  2004  onward  and  possible   oil   price   rises,    inflationary   pressures   are    expected  to  remain  relativ ely  subdued  with  inflation   projected to slightly increase to 2.3% in 2005 and then  move  back  toward  2%  by   2006.  Monetary  conditions   appear  stable  with  a  slight  restrictive  bias,  which   helps  to  keep  the  exchange   rate  steady  vis-à-vis  the   euro.  In  the  con text  of  moderate  inflation  pressures   and  ongoing  fiscal  consolidati on,  interest  rates  were   lowered by 25 basis points in February 2005.  Public finances  The 2004 deficit is estimated  to have declined to 4.2%  of  GDP,  down  from  6.3%  of  GDP  in  2003.  This   distinctly   better-than-expected    positive   outcome   is    attributed    to    the    successful    impact    of    fiscal     consolidation  measures  both  on  the  expenditure  and   revenue  side,  despite  negative  revenue  effects  linked   to   delays   in   the   introducti on   of   some   measures    initially  planned  for  2004  a nd  which  are  now  to  be   implemented  in  2005.  Reven ues  were  also  supported   by     a     more     domestic-demand     based     growth      composition,   leading   to   extra   tax   revenues.   This    outturn  for  2004,  together  with  the  recent  successful   negotiations  with  social  partners  on  a  number  of  key   planned   consolidation    measures   and   the   ongoing    implementation  of  other  m easures  planned  for  2005,   provide the basis for a further projected deficit decline  to  just  below  3%  of  GDP   in  2005.  The  projected   deficit  of  1.9%  of  GDP  for  2006  is  marginally  above   the  Cyprus  updated  convergence  programme  target,   which  is  mainly  linked  to  the  slightly  lower  forecast   GDP growth projection for 2006.  		
April/2005	Latvia	Vigorous growth and wide current account deficit 	Recent developments in activity  In  2004,  GDP  growth  is  estimated  at  a  remarkably   high   8.5%   (7.5%   in    2003).   Gross   fixed   capital    formation  and  private  consumption  have  been  the   driving     factors     for     growth.     Strong     private      consumption    was    supported    by    increased    bank     lending  and,  to  a  much  lesser  extent,  by  employment   and real income growth. Gr oss fixed capital formation  was  particularly  buoyant  as  a  result  of  favourable   credit  conditions,  the  inflow  of  the  EU  funds  and   reinforced    macroeconomic    stability.    The    fastest     growing  sectors  were  construc tion  and  transport  and   communications.  Industrial  output  grew  at  a  more   modest  pace.  Export  values  grew  by  close  to  20   percent,  however,  not  sufficien t  to  outpace  imports,   which  grew  by  around  25  percent.  Thus,  the  already   large  external  deficit   widened  even   further,  resulting   in  a  sizeable  negative  growth  contribution.  Imports   were  buoyed  by  input  growth   broadly  in  line  with   final  demand  as  well  as  the  unexpectedly  strong   stockbuilding observed just before EU accession.  Prospects for 2004-2006  Growth  prospects  for  2005-2006  are  strong  with  an   expected  expansion  of  about  7%  in  both  years.  Final   domestic  demand  is  expected  to  continue  to  drive   growth,  primarily  led  by   investment,  with  housing   construction increasing  strongly. Private  consumption  is  also  expected  to  remain  strong  largely  because  of   better   credit   access   and   modest   increases   in   real    disposable  income.  The  recovery  of  the  EU  economy   and  positive  externalities  of  Latvia’s  accession  to  the   EU  will  keep  export  growth  strong.  Nevertheless,   import growth is expected to  remain robust due to the  increase   of   investment   and   intermediate   goods.    Although    import    growth    is    projected    to    slow     somewhat  in  2005,  narro wing  the  trade  deficit,  the   negative  net  contribution  to  GDP  growth  from  trade   will remain considerable in  both 2005  and 2006.  Given the net export performance, the current account  deficit  increased  to  12.4%  of  GD P  in  2004.  The   worsening   of   the   trad e   balance   was   only   partly    compensated  by  weaker-than-expected  surpluses  on   the services account. In 2005, it is expected that some  of  the  accumulated  stocks   will  substitute  part  of  the   imports,   so   that   th e   current   account   deficit   will    decrease,  but  is  expected  to  remain  roughly  at  the   same level afterwards.  Labour market, costs and prices  High    growth    has    contr ibuted    to    lowering    the     unemployment   rate,   though   upward   pressure   on    unemployment from enterprise and rural restructuring  is  expected  to  persist.  In   spite  of  a  strong  growth   performance,  and  sizeable  employment  gains  since   2001,  the  unemployment  rate  thus  remains  at  just   below 10% of the labour force and is forecast to drop  only    slightly    in    the    medium    term.    Moderate     employment  gains  of  around  ½%  per  year  over  the   forecast period will contribute to the decline, although  considerable   regional   deve lopment   disparities   will    hold  back  a  faster  improvement  in  labour  market   conditions.  Inflation  rose  sharply  in  2 004.  The  pick- up  in  prices   has been reflected in all inflation indices, with that for  producer  prices  outpacing  consumer  prices  since  the   middle  of  the  year.  For  2 004  inflation  reached  6.2%,   up from 2.9% in 2003. The inflation increase in 2004  is largely accounted for by one-off events, such as EU  entry-related   tax   and    price   adjustments,   and   a    significant deprecia tion of the lats vis-à-vis the euro at  the  end  of  2003.  It  was  also  due  to  higher  regulated   prices  for  gas,  heating  and  rent  as  well  as  to  a  sharp   rise in healthcare costs. The  main risk to the inflation  outlook is that price increases could become persistent  if  strong  demand  continues  to  drive  output  above   potential and feeds into in flation expectations. Taking  this  into  account,  inflation  is  expected  to  average   5.0% in 2005 and to  fall back to 3.6% in 2006.  Public finances  The  general  government  deficit  in  2004  decreased  to   0.8% of GDP largely due to better–than-expected tax  revenues i .  For  the  forecast  period  good  economic   prospects,  with  average  annual  growth  around  7%   forecast  in  2005-2006,  should  have  a  positive  impact   on tax receipts. Moreover, a broadening of the indirect  tax   base   should   outweigh   the   narrowing   of   the    personal  income  tax  base  due   to  increase  in  the   personal income tax-free threshold and tax rebates for  dependents  in  force  sin ce  January  2005.  The  2005   budget    law    indicates    a    shift    towards    a    more     expansionary    fiscal    policy    consistent    with    the     frontloading   of   the   implementation   of   EU-funds- related     projects.     Given     the     commitment     of      expenditures  budgeted  on   support  from  EU  funding,   the achievement of the de ficit targets is conditional on  the receipt of such funds in government revenues. The  associated  risks  of  expenditure  overruns  stem  from   the    strain    that    project    management    puts    on     administrative  capacity.  All  together,  the  deficit  is   expected  to  remain  at  around  1.5%  of  GDP  in  2005- 2006.  		
April/2005	Lithuania	Robust growth, albeit slowing down 	Recent developments  Real output growth remained  robust in 2004, although  the  pace  of  expansion  slackened.  After  growing  at   9.7% in 2003, GDP is estima ted to have increased by  6.7% in 2004. As in previous years, domestic demand  expanded more rapidly than GDP and continued to be  the  major  driver  for  growth,  fuelled  by  particularly   strong investment and  private consumption.   The  contribution  of  net  trad e  to  growth  deteriorated   further  in  2004.  The  main  factor  was  a  significant   widening  of  the  visible  trade  balance,  induced  by  a   surging  demand  for  consum er  and  investment  goods.   Preliminary estimations set the current account deficit  at   about   8.3%   of   GDP   in    2004.   Foreign   direct    investment is estimated to  have increased significantly  in 2004 and contributed to finance a significant share  of the deficit (above 4% of GDP).  Following  a  deflationary   period  of  nearly  two  years,   prices  started  edging  up  in   May  2004.  This  mostly   reflected  rising  oil,  food,  transport  and  health-care   prices,  some  of  which  were  driven  by  tax  alignments   due   to   EU   accession.   Annual   average   inflation    measured  by  the  HICP  index  s tood  at  1.1%  in  2004.   Inflation accelerated further in the first two months of  2005, reaching 3.3% in  February year-on- year, largely  driven by increases in en ergy and tr ansport prices.  Evidence  on  recent  labour  market  developments  has   been mixed. On the one hand, the unemployment rate  is  estimated  to  have  declined  further  in  2004.  On  the   other  hand,  employment   growth,  which  had  been   notably strong in the prev ious two years, is estimated  to  have  been  negative  in  2004.  Emigration  seems  to   be  contributing  to  the   fall  in  unemployment,  while   labour  shortages  in  some  sectors  and  the  structural   nature   of   unemployment    remain   as   a   matter   of    concern.  Growth prospects   The forecast for real GDP growth in 2005 and 2006 is  broadly  unchanged,  respectively  at  6.4%  and  5.9%.   Gross  fixed  capital   formation  is  exp ected  to  continue   as the major driving force, remaining well above GDP  growth. Investment is foreseen  to be sustained by low  interest rates, high credit growth  and a higher capacity  to  absorb  EU  investment   grants.  Private  consumption   is    also    foreseen    to     remain    robust,    although     progressively slowing down from  the high level of the  previous   two   years,   partly   du e   to   an   anticipated    moderation  of  the  present  credit  growth  dynamics.   Public  consumption  growth  is   estimated  to  peak  in   2005  and  slow  down  signif icantly  in  2006,  in  line   with the government’s fiscal  consolidation plans.     Following   a   marked   de terioration   in   2004,   the    contribution  of  net  exports   to  growth  is  expected  to   remain  negative  during  2005-2006,  although  export   growth is expected to accelerate to above 7%. Import  growth  is  foreseen  to  offset   that  of  exports  in  2005,   led  by  robust  demand  of  consumer  and  investment   goods.  The  cu rrent  account  deficit  is  expected  to   widen  in  2005  and  start   a  gradual  improvement  in   2006, when it is foreseen to reach 8.5% of GDP.  Labour market, costs and prices   Unemployment is expected to continue declining over  the  forecast  horizon,  although  the  private  sector’s   capacity to meet increasing do mestic demand through  additional  hiring  is  foreseen   to  weaken  somewhat,  as   skill    mismatches    are    becoming    more    evident.     Employment growth is expected to become positive in  2005-2006.  Emigration  and  labour  shortages  in  some   segments  of  the  labour  ma rket  are  likely  to  put  some   pressure  on  wages,  while  la bour  productivity  growth   is  expected  to  remain  relatively  hi gh,  contributing  to   partly  temper  the  impact  of  higher  wages  on  unit   labour costs.   HICP average inflation is expected to increase further  to  2.9%  in  2005  and  decelerate  somewhat  in  2006.   Inflation is likely to be driv en by price increases in the  administered and transport sectors and by higher wage  inflation.  Risks  to  th e  inflation  projections  are  on  the  upside.  Cost  pressures  from  commodity  prices  have   been   building   up   in   the   last   months,   particularly    affecting  construction  prices,  and  some  pass-through   to  consumer  prices  might   take  place.  In  addition,   labour  shortages  and  the  recen t  pick-up  of  inflation   after  two  deflationary  years  could  increase  inflation   expectations.    The    behaviour    of    import    prices,     particularly oil prices, appears to be a major risk.  Public finances  The  general  government  defic it  is  estimated  to  have   increased  from  1.9%  of  GDP  in  2003  to  2.5%  in   2004 i .  The  main  factors  contributing  to  the  deficit   deterioration  compared  to  2003  relate  to  increases  in   public   investment,   salary   increases   in   the   public    sector, welfare benefits, and real estate restitutions.   The   deficit-to-GDP   ratio   is   expected   to   decrease    marginally in 2005,  declining further to  1.9% in 2006.  Revenue growth is expected to  remain strong over the  forecast period. Tax revenues, particularly income and  wealth  taxes  and  social  contributions,  are  foreseen  to   increase  significantly  on  the  back  of   strong  growth   and  higher  employment,  and   also  induced  by  rising   wages  and  corporate  profits.  A  sizeable  increase  in   EU  transfers  will  lead  to  a  rise   in  non-tax  revenues.   Government     expenditure     is     expected     to     rise      significantly   in   2005,   led    by   increases   in   capital    expenditure,    subsidies,    sal ary    increases    in    the     education  and  healthcare  sectors  and  the  cost  of  the   pension  reform.  Strong  revenue  growth  and  lower   growth  of  current  expenditure  are  expected  to  lead  to   an improvement of the deficit in 2006. 		
April/2005	Luxembourg	Still growing faster than its neighbours 	The situation in 2004  In    2004,    GDP    continued    to    grow    faster    in     Luxembourg  than  in  neighbo uring  countries,  which   also  had  been  observed  during  the  latest  slowdown.   According  to  a  preliminary   estimate,  growth  reached   4.2% in 2004.  Activity   was   especially   buoyant   in   industry   with    production  rising  by  near ly  6%  and  the  steel  sector   recording    exceptional    growth    rates,    though    a     slowdown  was  observed  in  the  seco nd  half  of  the   year.  Activity  in  construction  slightly  declined  but   only   because   civil   engineering   suffered   from   the    slowdown in government investment, while in the rest  of   the   sector   it   increased   by   about   3½%.   Trade    performed  well,  even  if   retail  trade  was  somewhat   subdued,  reflecting  rather   weak  growth  in  private   consumption.   Transport,   especially   air   transport,    clearly  recovered  from  its  slo wdown.  Finally,  in  the   financial   sector,   activity   gr ew   strongly   although          profits  stagnated  because  the  decline  in  the  interest   margin  compensated  for  the   good  results  of  financial   markets transactions.  Private  consumption  was  rather  subdued  in  recent   years  since  the  positive   effects  of  the  2001-2002  tax   cuts  had  faded  away.  It  remained  relatively  weak  in   2004,  growing  only  by  1.8% .  Investment ,  which  had   fallen, mostly for incidental reasons, by more than 6%  in  2003,  rose  by  a  similar  pe rcentage  in  2004.  Both   exports   and   imports,   which   had   risen   by   only   a    modest  1½–2%  in  real  terms  in  2003,  recovered  in   2004, growing by abou t 6% in both cases.     Employment growth follo wed the slowdown in output  with  a  two-year  lag,  slowing  from  a  peak  of  5.7%  in   2001 to 1.8% in 2003, and accelerating again to 2.4%  in  2004.  However,  as  in   previous  years,   the  lion’s   share  of  new  jobs  went  to  cross-border  workers,   whose    number    rose    by    4.7%,    while    national     employment  only  increased  by  1.3%.  This  rise  in   residents’  employment  was  not   sufficient  to  prevent   unemployment  from  increasing  to  4.2%  of  the  active   population from 3.8% in 2003.  Consumer price inflation, as measured by the Eurostat  harmonised   index,   significantly   accelerated   from    2.5%   in   2003   to   3.2%    in   2004.   However,   this    relatively high inflation rate is in large part due to the  rise in oil prices and the increase in taxes on tobacco:  the    rise    in    the    national    CPI,    which    excludes     consumption  by  non-resident s  and  especially  their   large purchases of car fuel and tobacco products, was  significantly slower, 2.2% in 2004 as against 2.0% in  2003.   Moreover,   underlying    inflation   significantly    decelerated during the year.       Prospects for 2005 and 2006  Real GDP growth is expected to  slow down slightly in  2005  before  re-accelerating  in  2006,  though  it  should   remain  in  the  region  of  4%  throughout  the  forecast   period.    Private    consumption    should    accelerate     together with employment  (even if the largest share of  jobs  created  is  once  again  expected   to  go  to  non- residents).  This  should  more  than  compensate  for  the   expected   slowdown   in   wages.   Investment   should    remain  dynamic.    The  rise  in  exports  markets  is   expected   to   slightly   decelerate   over   the   period.    Simultaneously,  wage  increases  will  probably  slow   down  somewhat  in  line  with   domestic  inflation.  As  a   result, export growth should decelerate only modestly  and  the  contribution  of  net  exports  to  GDP  growth   should remain widely positive.   Employment    growth    is    forecast    to    accelerate,     reflecting  output  growth  in  recent  years,  and  to  reach   about  3%  at  the  end  of  the  period  (which  is  not   exceptionally high by Luxemb ourg’s standards). As in  previous  years,  the  bulk  of   job  creation  should  go  to   non-residents but the rise in  national employment will  progressively  accelerate  too,  so  that  unemployment   should peak in 2005 and begi n to decrease slightly in  2006. Inflation  is  projected  to   progressively  diminish  over   the  period,  in  line  with  th e  expected  decrease  in  oil   prices    and    the    absence    of    significant    internal     inflationary pressures. The share of oil products being  significantly  higher  in  th e  harmonised  index  than  in   the national index, the slowdown in the former should  also be more marked. Public finances  After   a   sharp   decline   in   the   general   government    surplus from a record 6.2% of  GDP in 2000 and 2001  to 0.5% in 2003, a 1.1% of GDP deficit was recorded  in  2004  (compared  to  a  1.4%  deficit  projected  by  the   authorities  in  their  upd ated  stability  programme).  As   expected,     tax     revenues     significantly     exceeded      projections    but,    at    the    same    time,    investment     expenditure was revised upwards in order to take into  account  some  big  projects  based  on  a  public-private   partnership  that  had  not  been  previously  recorded  in   the  government  sector.  The  latter  pushed  up  public   spending  figures  by  about  half  a  percentage  point  of   GDP.  Reflecting  the  relatively  strong  gro wth  in  output  and   employment,   government   revenues   should   remain    buoyant,  rising  by   about  6%  in  both  years,  compared   to 4% in 2003 and 5% in 2004. However, government  spending, though decelerating, is still projected to rise  by about 7% a year in 2005 and 2006 As a result, the  deficit  would  progressively  widen  to  about  1½%  of   GDP in 2005 and 2% in  2006. The pub lic debt, which  was  also  revised  upwards,  for  the  same  reason  as   government  investment,  fro m  5.7%  to  7.5%  of  GDP   in 2004, should slightly rise to ab out 8% in 2006.    		
April/2005	Hungary	More balanced growth, further fiscal consolidation needed 	The situation in 2004   GDP continued to grow vi gorously in the second half  of  2004,  resulting  in  an  annual  growth  rate  of  4%.   Growth  became  more  balanced:  private  consumption   growth more than halved due to a significant decrease  in   net   disposable   income,   while   investment   and    exports  rose  strongly  and   the  contribution  of  the   external sector to GDP growth became positive.   Following  three  years  of  strong  real  wage  increases,   averaging  more  than  10%  per  year,  wage  growth   decelerated  in  2004,  mainly  due  to  a  significant  real   wage  decrease  in  the  public  sector.  After  consumer   price  inflation  rose  to  around  7%  in  the  first  half  of   2004,  largely  owing  to  tax  and  price  adjustments,  it   started to fall again in the second half of the year. This  was  supported  by  the  strong  value  of  the  forint,  as   well   as   lower   food   and   o il   prices.   Against   the    background  of  an  improving  inflation  outlook,  the   central bank cut its policy rat es by 200 basis points in  the course of 2004.  The increase in unemployment accelerated from mid- 2004  and  reached  a  yearly  average  of  around  6%.   Despite  the  slowdown  of  consumption  growth,  the   current  account  deficit  is  estimated  to  have  remained   close to 9% of GDP in 2004, increasingly financed by  non-debt-creating inflows.  Prospects for 2005 and 2006  GDP   growth   is   projected   to    remain   solid   in   the    forecast  period,  with  export  and  investment  growth   decelerating only slowly. Given the moderate increase  of  real  disposable  income  in  2004  and  the  expected   continuation    of    this     trend    until    2006,    private     consumption  is  projected  to  slow  down  further  in   2005 to about 3% and to remain  at this level in 2006.   Investment growth is forecast to remain robust but to  ease   somewhat   in   2005   when   the   tightening   of    subsidies  for  housing  loans   dating  back  to  the  end  of   2003   is   expected   to   have    its   full   impact   on    construction.  The  envisaged  sharp  decline  in  public   investment in 2005 (by 1.5 percentage point of GDP)  is  intended  to  be  largely  replaced  by  public-private   partnership projects (mainly  highway construction).   A  further  improvement  in  the  trade  balance  –  based   on the expectation that import growth will react more  strongly  to  the  softening  of  domestic  demand  than  in   2004 1   –  and  some  fiscal  tightening  should  contribute   to a moderate narrowing of the current account deficit  to 7% of GDP by 2006.  Labour market, costs and prices  Employment  which  dropp ed  by  0.5%  in  2004,  is   expected to grow by 0.5% in  2005 and 0.9% in 2006,  leading   to   a   small   deceleration   in   productivity.    Nevertheless,  the  unemploy ment  rate  is  projected  to   slightly increase to 6.2% in 20 06 (Eurostat definition)  because of a stronger rise in the total labour force.    Year-on-year   inflation   is   expected   to   decelerate    sharply  in  the  first  half  of  2005,  also  supported  by  a   decline   in   inflation   expectations.   Consumer   price    inflation should fall below an annual average of 4% in  2005 and declin e slightly more in  2006. Accordingly,  a  further  reduction  in  short-term  interest  rates  can  be   expected in the forecasting period.  Public finances  The Hungarian authorities decid ed to avail themselves  of  the  possibility  of  the  temporary  reclassification  of   second   pillar   pension   fund s   inside   the   general    government  as  permitted   by  Eurostat  until  the  March   2007  fiscal  notification  (decision  of  23  September   2004).   This   forecast   therefore   uses   the   official    reclassified    figures    which    reduce    the    general    government  deficit  by  0.9,  1.1  and  1.2  percentage   points of GDP in 2004,  2005 and 200 6, respectively.   According    to    data    notified     by    the    Hungarian     authorities, the deficit was reduced  to 4.5% of GDP in  2004, by 1.7 percentage po int of GDP below the 2003  outturn.   This   largely   reflects    the   methodological    change  of  accounting  VAT  refunds,  increasing  the   2003  deficit  by  0.7  percentage  point  of  GDP  and   reducing  the  2004  deficit  accordingly,  which  might   however be subject to  further revision.  Regarding  the  2005  de ficit,  while  there  are  some   positive trends in view of  lower-than-expected interest  rates,   the   impact   of   the   freezing   of   carried-over    appropriations  from  2004  to  2005,  and  an  improved   outlook  for  corporate  taxes,  there  are  also  increased   risks  in  some  areas.  Notably  VAT  revenues  and  the   budgetary   impact   of   the   intended   public-private- partnership    projects    are    subject    to    uncertainty.     Following the renewed recommendation of the Ecofin  Council   to   Hungary   un der   the   Excessive   Deficit    Procedure on 8 March, the Government has increased  from   0.5   to   0.8   percentage   point   of   GDP   its    “emergency”   reserve   package   against   a   possible    missing   of   the   2005   target,   and   identified   some    limited   further   revenues.   Although   this   has   been    largely  taken  into  consid eration,  risks  of  possible   slippages  remain.  For  20 06  an  increase  in  public   investment   is   expected,    which   is   however   not    compensated  by  expenditure-improving  effects  of  the   measures  contained  in  the  2005  budget,  especially   since   they   were   not   backed   by   comprehensive    reforms. Hence, the deficit is expected to rise again to  4.1%  of  GDP  in  2006,  from  3.9%  of  GDP  in  2005,   based on the usual no-policy change assumption. 		
April/2005	Malta	Public finance consolidation reaffirmed 	Economic develo pments in 2004  After  falling  in  real  terms  by  1.8%  in  2003,  GDP   growth   turned   positive   to    1.5%   in   2004.   Private    consumption  decelerated  to  1%  in  2004  (from  2%  in   2003),  reflecting  lower  disposa ble  income.  This  was   mainly  the  result  of  an   increase  in  taxes  when  wage   growth  remained  barely  changed.  On  the  other  hand   ongoing  fiscal  consolidation  led  public  consumption   to  further  slow  down  to  a  meagre  0.6%.  Gross  fixed   capital  formation  growth  fell  sh arply  to  5.3%  from   34%  in  2003,  although  th is  is  attributable  to  a  base   effect  caused  by  a  one-off  operation  registered  as  a   negative investment in 2002.   Exports  of  goods  and  servi ces  briskly  recovered  to   +2.5%   in   2004   from   –3.8%   in   2003,   mirroring    stronger  world  demand  fo r  semiconductors  and  the   improvement  in  the  to urist  sector.  Import  growth   halved  to  3.5%  due  to  an  unforeseen  deceleration  in   imports   of   goods.   However,   the   terms   of   trade    deteriorated  notably,  worseni ng  the  external  balance   of goods and services to a  nominal deficit of 7.7% of  GDP  (from  5.5%  of  GDP  in   2003).  Accordingly,  the   contribution  to  GDP  growth   from  domestic  demand   fell markedly to 1.9 pp (7  pp in the previous year). In  contrast,  the  foreign  sector   contribution  improved,  as   compared  with  the  previou s  year,  detracting  only  1.2   pp to output (-1 0.2 pp in 2003).  Employment  increased  by  1.4%,  after  a  fall  in  the   previous  year,  due  to  the  completion  of  industrial   restructuring.   The HICP inflation stood at 2.7%, significantly below  the  figure  projected  in  the  previous  forecast.  This  is   explained  by  increased   competition  stemming  from   import  liberalization  in  a  context  of  flimsy  internal   demand.  Prospects for 2005 and 2006 Real  GDP  is  expected  to  accelerate  to  1.7%  in  2005.   For 2006, GDP growth rate is forecast to attain 1.9%.  Supported   by   a   recovery    of   employment,   private    consumption  is  projected  to  grow  by  1%  in  2005,   barely   changed   from   the   previous   year,   while   it    should accelerate to 1.5% in 2006. The ongoing fiscal  consolidation  programme  is  lik ely  to  keep  growth  of   public  consumption  is  rat her  flat  over  the  forecast   period.  The  gradual  comple tion  of  some  important   public  investment  projects,  which  should  boost  gross   fixed capital formation to 6.6% in 2005, would lower  investment growth to 1.9% in 2006.   Exports are foreseen to gain momentum, pulled up by  stronger   demand   for   semi conductors,   growing   by    3.3%  in  2005  and  200 6.  Conversely,  imports  are   expected to loose some pace, as the completion of the  above-mentioned  investment  project  is  progressively   achieved.   All  in  all,  domestic  demand  is  likely  to  contribute  to   2.1  pp  to  growth  in  2005  (1.5  pp  in  2006),  while  the   contribution  from  the  external  sector  is  projected  to   remain  slightly  negative,  de ducting  0.2  pp  to  growth   in   2005.   This   sh ould   reverse   in    2006,  when  the   external sector would add  0.5 pp to GDP growth.  The  external  current  account  deficit  is  projected  to   remain close to 10% of GDP over the forecast period.  An  across-the-board  deter ioration  in  the  main  sub- accounts  of  the  Balance  of  Payments  already  started   in  2004,  which   brought  about  a  d ecline  in  reserve   assets  of  3.7%  of  GDP.  Thi s  deterioration  stems   mainly from a worsening  of the trade balance, whose  deficit   would   widen   above   16%   of   GDP.   The    financial  account  depends  on  the  offshore-banking   operations,  which  make  it  highly  volatile,  and  by   transfers  related  to  EU  funds,  which  are  estimated  to   increase as projects materialized.  Labour market, costs and prices  Job  creation  is  projected  to  accelerate  as  economic   recovery   gains   momentum   and   the   restructuring    process  in  the  manufacturing  sector  is  concluded.   Unemployment  would  smoothly  decline  throughout  the  forecast  period  from  7.3%  in  2004  to  7.0%  in   2006.  Despite  the  rise  in  energy  and  water  prices,  HICP   inflation  is  expected  to  further  decline  to  2.4%  in   2005 and 2.1% in 2006.  This decline is mainly due to  the phasing out of th e impact of th e 2004 VAT rise in  2005  and  2006,   along  with  an  incr ease  in  product   competition.    Neverthe less,    these    projections    are     subject    to    some    degree    of    uncertainty    since     developments in the HICP are strongly influenced by  price volatility in the tourist  sector and by changes in  the external trade prices.   Public finances  The consolidation measures implemented in the 2004  budget  brought  the  deficit   down  to  5.2%  of  GDP,   from a recently revised deficit of over 10% of GDP in  2003.  The revenue increasing measures and the expenditure  cuts  planned  in  the  2005  budget  are  expected  to   reduce  the  general  government  deficit  to  3.9%  of   GDP, while the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach 76.4%  of GDP in 2005 up from 75%  in 2004. For  2006, the  deficit  is  expected  to  further  decrease  to  2.8%  of   GDP,  and  the  debt  ratio  rise  to  77%  of  GDP.  These   projections  are  based  on   the  usual  no n-policy  change   scenario    for    revenues    and    current    expenditure.     However,   the   projection    for   capital   expenditures    incorporates  the  fall  associated  to  the  finalization  of   the  Italian  Protocol.  The  debt  figures  do  not  take  on   board  the  eventual  effect  of  stock-flows  adjustments   produced  by  some  privati zation  operations  foreseen   by the government.  		
April/2005	Netherlands	Cloudy weather, silver linings 	The situation in 2004  Following  the  recession  in  20 03,  when  real  GDP  fell   by  0.9%,  the  Dutch  economy   recovered  in  2004  with   real  GDP  growth  reaching  1.3%  on  average.  First   estimates  of  the  quarterly  national  accounts  indicate   that economic activity contracted  slightly in the fourth  quarter  of  2004,  after  positive  growth  in  the  third   quarter. The recovery was driv en both by international  trade   and   domestic   demand.   Investment   growth    picked    up    but    private    consumption    remained     lacklustre  (growing  only   by  0.5%).  Employment  fell   for     the     second     consecutive     year     while     the      unemployment  rate,  having  fallen  slightly  over  the   summer,  increased   again  in  the  last  part  of  2004,  and   averaged  slightly  below  5% .  However,  the  moderate   increase    in    vacancies    last    year    suggests    an     improvement    in    employment    prospects.    HICP     inflation fell to 1.4%, from 2.2% in 2003, in response  to weak activity and moderate wage costs. Significant  price  cuts  by  major  retail  chains  in  an  attempt  to   (re)capture   a   larger   share   of   the   market   further    contributed to lower inflation.  Private consumption to remain the weak link  Economic  activity  is  forecast  to   improve  gradually   over  the  projection  horizon.   However,  partly  due  to   negative carry-over effects,  real GDP growth in 2005  will  still  be  slightly  lower  th an  in  2004,  at  1.0%.   Exports   are   expected   to   grow   by   4%.   Despite    moderate   wage   growth,   Dutch   exporters   will   not    experience    a    marked    improvement    in    external     competitiveness,  due  to   the  euro’s  app reciation,  the   rise  in  oil  prices,  and  competitive  pricing  conditions   in  world  markets.  The  importance  of  buoyant  re- exports  masks  the  further  losses  in  market  share  for   domestically  produced  export  goods  and  limits  the   positive  impact  on  overall  growth.  Domestic  demand   will  not  accelerate  markedly  in  2005.  This  is  mainly   because  private  consumption  continues  to  be  weak   (despite  a  stabilisation  in  employment),  due  to  low   confidence  and  the  impact  of  wage  moderation  and   fiscal   tightening   on   disposable   income.   Private    consumption   is   projected    to   remain   broadly   flat    (decreasing  by  0.2%),  with  a  foreseen  further  decline   in the consumption of durable goods broadly offset by  increases   in   private   health   care   expenditure.   By    contrast,  investment  growth  will  pick  up  moderately,   to  2.1%.  Whil e  financing  co nditions  are  favourable   and corporate balance sheets improved, weak demand  and  relatively  low  capacity  utilisation  implies  the   absence of a strong investment need. Although earlier  rises in oil prices push up consumer price inflation in  the  beginning  of  the  year,  mainly  through  higher  gas   and   electricity   prices,   inflation   is   set   to   slightly    moderate in the course of 2005 as underlying inflation  decreases in response to  falling wage costs.   Domestic  demand  is  expected   to  improve  further  in   2006,  causing  real  GDP  growth  to  increase  to  2.0%.   However,    the    pattern    of     public    and    private     consumption   demand   is   h eavily   distorted   by   the    effects  of  the  health  care  reform  effective  as  of  1   January.  The  reform  entails  the  abolishment  of  the   distinction  between  private  and  public  insurance  for   basic  health  insurance.  The  new  system  introduces  a   mandatory   public   insurance   for   basic   health   care    which  will  imply  a  reclassification  of  part  of  private   health  care  expenditure  as  public  consumption.  The   impact   of   the   reform   is   estimated   to   reduce   the    recorded  level  of  private  consumption  by  somewhat   less  than  2%  of  GDP,  raising  measured  government   consumption    by    the    sam e    amount.    Underlying     consumption     demand     will     improve     somewhat      compared  to  2005,  but  remains  rather  weak,  in  view   of the rather modest improvement in employment and  the expected further deceleration in compensation per  employee.  Export  growth  will  p ick  up  to  5.5%,  and   investment  is  expected  to   accelerate  in  2006,  but  the   strength of the recovery in in vestment is dampened by  the slack in domestic demand. Employment growth is  projected  to  increase  to  slightly  above  1%  in  2006  in   the  usual  lagged  response  to  an  economic  upturn,   leading  to  a  moderate  decrease  in  the  unemployment   rate.  In  view  of  the  expected  decline  in  oil  prices,  weak  import  prices,  the  delayed  pass-through  of  the   earlier  euro  appreciation,  and   a  fall  in  unit  labour   costs,  consumer  price  inflation  will  moderate  further,   to  0.7%  in  2006.  HICP   inflation  will  fall  to  around  - 3%  in  2006,  but   this  large  drop  is  mainly  due  to  the   statistical   impact   of   the   health   care   reform   on    harmonised inflation.  Deficit fell below 3% of GDP already in 2004  The  economic  downturn  took   a  heavy  toll  on  public   finances    in    the    down swing,    despite    substantial     consolidation  measures,  but  budgetary  prospects  are   currently  improving.  According  to  the  most  recent   data,  the  deficit  fell  markedly  in  2004,  to  2.5%  of   GDP,   compared   to   3.2%   of   GDP   in   2003.   This    improvement  reflected  fiscal  tightening,  lower-than- expected    expenditures    in    some    areas,    and    an     acceleration  in  tax  receipts  towards  the  end  of  2004   due  to  better  macroeconomic   conditions.  The  2005   budget   contains   considerable   further   consolidation    measures,  including  increases  in  income  tax  rates,   reduced  access  to  unemployment  benefits,  and  the   phasing  out  of  subsidies  on  low-paid  labour.  The   agreement  reached  in  November  2004  between  the   government  and  social  part ners  modifying  planned   reforms in the areas of social security and pensions in  return for wage moderation should secure the savings  planned for 2005. Fiscal con solidation will help bring  down  the  deficit  to  2.0%   of  GDP  in  2005  despite   lacklustre  economic  growth.  In   line  with  the  cyclical   recovery,  the  general  government  deficit  will  fall   further  in  2006  to  1.6%  of  GDP.  The  government   debt-to-GDP ratio is still forecast to rise, from 55.7%  of GDP in 2004 to 57.9% in 2006. However, the exact  impact  of  the  reforms  in  the  areas  of  pension  and   health  care  to  be  implemen ted  in  2006  is  difficult  to   assess.		
April/2005	Austria	Moderate recovery to continue  	Developments in 2004  Austria’s  economy  grew  by  2%  in  2004,  accelerating   from 0.8% in the prev ious year. Activity was boosted  by  world  trade,  with  net   exports  contributing  more   than  one  percentag e  point  to  GDP   growth.  Support   came  also  from  a  notable  increase  in  investment   volumes,  both  in  response  to  export  demand  and  a   fiscal  investment  premium,  which  expired  by  the  end   of  the  year  and  which  led  to  a  sizeable  amount  of   investment being carried forw ard. As the upswing was  accompanied  by  a  marked  increase  in  employment,   private consumption also picked up.  However,  following  very  solid  quarterly  growth  rates   between 0.6% and 0.8% in the first three quarters, the  recovery has slowed to a quarterly rate of 0.3% in the  fourth  quarter,  in  line  with  the  (temporary)  weakness   in the neighbouring economi es, notably Germany and  Italy.  Especially  tourism  revenues  remained  below   expectations,  but  also  investment  and  consumption   could  not  maintain  the  relatively  high  growth  pace   they had earlier in the year.   Prospects for 2005 and 2006  The  economy  is  expected  to  continue  growing  at  a   solid   rate.   Domestic   c onsumption   should   respond    positively   to   a   sizeable   tax   reduction   and   rising    employment.  However,  consump tion  growth  is  likely   to  lag  behind  the  increase  in  disposable  incomes,   leading to an increase in the savings rate.   A  dampening  factor  is  an  expected  dip  in  investment   volumes   following   immediately   after   the   subsidy    phase-out  in  January.  Investment  should,  however,   quickly resume its healthy growth  in the light of rising  demand  and  growing  profits.  The  reduction  in  the   corporate   tax   rate   will   also   make   Austria   more    attractive for foreign investors.  Housing construction,  having  suffered  from  slack  demand  for  new  homes   and  persistent  excess  office  space,  should  pick  up   moderately and will no longer constitute a drag on the  economy.  As  regards  the  external  side,  unit  labour  costs  are   expected to grow at a rate below the EU average and  export  prices  relative  to   its  trading  partners  should   continue  to  fall  in  2005.   Even  so,  the  importance  of   the   external   contribution   to   growth   will   weaken    substantially due to slacken ing world demand.  Labour market, costs, and prices  Employment   is   expected   to   grow   throughout   the    forecast  period.  The  increased  employment  does  not,   however,    translate    into    an    equal    reduction    in     unemployment,  owing  to   the  high  elasticity  of  labour   supply and sizeable immigration.    Consumer price inflation should stay at a rate close to  2%  in  2004  and  2005,  driven  by  rising  energy  prices   and  taxes  and  higher  tobacco  excise  duties.  As  this   effect wears off, consumer pri ce inflation should slow  in 2006.  Public finances  In  2004,  the  first  step  of  a  major  tax  reform  was   implemented, with parts of th e 2005 instalment being  brought  forward  to  2004.  The  reform  consisted  of  a   lowering  of  tax  rates  (personal   and  corporate  income   taxes)  equivalent  to  0.3  %  of  GDP,  the  effect  on   overall  revenues  being  offset  by  increases  in  mineral   oil and energy taxes. The measures of the 2005 reform  brought   forward   to   2004    comprised   higher   tax    allowances  for  ch ildren,  worth  about  0.1  %  of  GDP,   which  were  not  financed  by  expenditure  cuts.  Being   largely  export-driven,  the   composition  of  growth  in   2004  was  tax-un friendly.  On  the  other  hand,  tax   revenues   benefited   fro m   substantial   cross-border    petrol  shopping  from  Germany,  amounting  to  more   than  0.3%  of  GDP.  All  in  all,  the  deficit  rose  by  0.2   pp compared with 2003 to 1.3% of GDP in 2004.  At 2.0% of GDP, the deficit in 2005 is projected to be  ¾%  of  GDP  higher  than  in  2004.  The  fact  that  GDP   growth  was  lower  than  the  official  forecast,  explains   why  the  deficit  is  projected   to  widen  slightly  more   than   expected   by   the    national   authorities.   The    dominating factor is the implementation of the second  stage  of  the  tax  reform  2004/2005.  The  personal   income tax is reduced to four tax brackets, including a  zero  tax  bracket  up  to  an  income  of  €10  000.  The   corporate tax rate is reduced from 34% to 25%, while  tax rules for holdings (do mestic and foreign) are also  simplified.  The  agricultural   sector  is  exempted  from   mineral oil tax. Th e burden on the  budget is estimated  to  amount  to  1%  of  GDP,  although  the  effects  from   the  new  holding  taxation   are  difficult  to  measure  and   may  pose  a  budgetary  risk.  The  health  care  reform  is   projected  to  lead  to  additional  revenues  of  0.1  %  of   GDP,  mainly  due  to  an   increase  in  th e  contribution   rate  of  0.1  pp  and  an  increase  in  the  tobacco  tax.   Streamlining    the    health    care    administration    is     expected    to    lead    to    expenditure    savings    of     approximately the same size.   On  the  basis  of  the  no- policy-change  assu mption,  the   2006  deficit  is  expected  to  fall  by  ¼  pp  to  1.7%  of   GDP,  as  the  economy  is  expected  to  grow  above   potential    and    some    spending    programmes    (in     particular  the  subsidy  on   additional  investment)  will   no longer burden the budget.   The  debt  ratio i   is  expected  to   ease  down  slightly   during  the  forecasting  peri od,  while  remaining  above   the 60% of GDP reference value. 		
April/2005	Poland	Still vigorous growth amidst persistent fiscal uncertainties 	Economic situation in 2004  While   still   robust,   economic   activity   decelerated    markedly  in  the  second  half  of  2004,  with  real  GDP   growth  slowing  to  4.3%  year-on-year  from  6.5%  in   the  first  half  of  the  year.   The  slowdown  in  activity   mostly  reflected  the  phase-out  of  the  pre-EU-entry   one-off   effects   that   contributed   to   the   impressive    performance of the Polish econ omy in the first half of  the  year.  For  2004  as  a  whole,  real  GDP  growth   reached  5.3%  against  3.8%  in  2003.  As  in  2003,   growth    was    mainly    driven    by    exports,    which     continued to grow strongly de spite the appreciation of  the    zloty    since    May.    However,    the    growth     contribution    of    the    external    sector    gradually     diminished  and  turned  negative  in  the  fourth  quarter   for   the   first   time   since   early   2003.   Household    consumption  expanded  moderately  on  the  back  of   weak   real   income   growth   and    persistently   high    unemployment,   while   fixe d   investment   rebounded    finally   after   falling   for   three   consecutive   years.    Investment  growth  started  to   recover  timidly  towards   the  end  of  2003  and  gained  momentum  in  the  course   of 2004, with an abrupt acceleration to over 7% year- on-year in the fourth quarter. In addition, growth was  sustained during most of  the year by a strong positive  contribution   from   stockbuilding.   While   the   rapid    growth  in  inventories  in  the  first  quarter  can  be   attributed  to  expectations  of  price  increases  after  EU   accession,  the  sharp  increase  in  the  following  two   quarters appears unusual in this phase of the economic  cycle. Prospects in 2005 and 2006  With the withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus,  growth   is   set   to   decelerate   this   year.   Monetary    conditions have become less  supportive, as a result of  both  the  real  effective  appreciation  of  the  zloty  and   the  interest  rate  hikes  of   mid-2004,  while  the  long- delayed fiscal adjustment starts this year. Overall, real  GDP growth is projected to slow to 4.4% in 2005. As  international    prospects    improve    and    monetary     conditions  ease  somewhat,  eco nomic  growth  should   rise, but only modestly, to 4.5%  in 2006. A shift in the  growth  pattern,  with  domestic  demand  taking  over   from  net  exports  as  the  ma in  contributor  to  growth,   was  already  at  work  in  the   fourth  quarter  of  2004.   This will continue in th e coming quarters, with a drag  from net exports expected for both 2005 and 2006.  Investment  growth  should  accelerate  further  in  2005   and  2006,  against  the   backdrop  of  emerging  capacity   constraints,     strong     corporate     profitability     and      accession-related business opportunities. In particular,  estimates  by  the  National  Bank  of  Poland  point  to   capacity  utilisation  rates  of  above  80%  in  the  first   quarter  of  2005,  against  a  low  of  73%  in  early  2002.   EU  funds  will  provide  a  further  boost  to  investment   activity,  which  is  projected  to  accelerate  to  around   10%  in  volume  terms  this  year  and  next.  Consumer   demand is also likely to strength en over the projection  period, helped by the turn around in the  labour market,  faster   real   wage   growth   and   growing   consumer    confidence.   Export  growth,  while  affected   by  the  appreciation  of   the zloty, should remain r obust this year, supported by productivity  gains  by  Po lish  firms.  Exports  would   grow somewhat faster next year against the backdrop  of a growth revival in Poland’s main trading partners.  Poland    would    continue    to    gain    market    shares     throughout the  forecast period, albeit at a slower pace  than in previous years. Given the high import content  of   Polish   exports   and    the   expected   recovery   in    investment activity, import gr owth is also projected to  pick  up  strongly  and  would  outpace  export  growth   from 2005 onwards.   The  risks  to  the  growth  outlook  are  skewed  to  the   downside.  Persistent  fiscal   and  political  uncertainties   remain  a  major  source  of  co ncern  for  the  strength  of   the  expected  investment  recovery.  Also,  a  slower- than-expected  improvement  in  the  labour  market  and   more moderate wage growth would hold back private  consumption.   Finally,   the   strong   zloty   and   weak    growth  in  the  EU  could  ca use  exports  to  grow  less   rapidly than projected.  Labour market, costs and prices  Labour  market  conditions  a ppear  to  be  improving   since    the    second    quarter    of    2004.    Overall,     employment     ceased     to     drop     last     year,     and      unemployment  decreased  by  0.4   percentage  points  to   18.8%  of  the  labour  force,  compared  to  a  peak  of   19.8%   in   2002.   As   economic   activity   remains    vigorous,  employment  growt h  is  expected  to  become   increasingly  strong  over  the  forecast  horizon.  This   should translate into a drop in the unemployment rate  by  a  little  over  a  full  percen tage  point  over  2005-06.   However,  unemployment  will  still  be  relatively  high,   at  17.6%  of  the  labour  for ce,  by  the  end  of  the   forecast  horizon,  reflecting  the  deep-seated  structural   problems      in      the      lab our      market.      Poland’s       unemployment  has  a  large  structural  component,  and   labour  market  difficulties  are   further  exacerbated  by   unfavourable   demographi c   developments   and   the    ongoing restructuring process in heavy industries and  agriculture.   HICP  inflation  increased  sharply  last  year,  reaching   3.6%  on  average,  up  from  0.7%  in  2003.  Consumer   price  inflation  overshot  the  upper  limit  of  the  central   bank’s  target  band  (2.5  ±  1  percent)  in  June  and   continued to rise to  4.6% year-on-year in July-August,  before  declining  to  4%  year-on-year  in  December.   The  surge  in  head line  inflation  was  mostly  due  to   rising   food   and   oil   prices   and   accession-related    increases in indirect taxes. In order to contain second- round effects of higher inflation, the National Bank of  Poland  raised  its  key  reference  rate  by  a  cumulative   125  basis  points  to  6.5%  between  June  and  August.   Core inflation picked up sign ificantly in mid-2004 but  has  stabilised  at  2.4%  year-on-year  since  September,   pointing to limited price pressures stemming from the  demand side to date.  With the fading of the one-off effects of EU accession  on     prices,     together     with     more     favourable      developments  in  food  and  oil  prices,  consumer  price   inflation  is  set  to  fall  this   year  despite  the  emergence   of  a  positive  output  gap.  Also,  the  strong  zloty  will   contribute to dampening inflationary pressures. As the  positive output gap widens  and unit labour costs pick  up, headline inflation should edge up in the course of  2006 and is projected to average 2.3% against 2.1% in  2005.  Unit labour cost growth is estima ted to have fallen by  0.7%   last   year,   owing   to   a   cyclical   pick-up   in    productivity   to   over   5%    combined   with   modest    compensation  growth.  However,  in  2005  and  2006,   this   is   likely   to   be    reversed   as   productivity   and    compensation  are  projected  to  move  in  the  opposite   direction.  Although  nominal  wages  are  expected  to   increase  in  order  to  at  least  sustain  growth  in  real   earnings,    high    unemploy ment    should    exert    a     moderating influence.   External accounts  Poland’s  export  performan ce  remained  strong  last   year  and,  although  import   growth  outstripped  export   growth  towards  the  end  of  2004,  the  current  account   deficit  narrowed  further  from   the  already  low  levels   recorded  in  2003.  The  deficit  reached  1.5%  of  GDP,   down  from  2.2%  in  2003.  Growing  imports  in  line   with  strengthening  domestic   demand  will  lead  to  a   steady   increase   in   the   trade   and   current   account    deficits  this  year  and  next.  However,  as  in  2004,   higher  transfers  from  the  EU  will  have  a  positive   impact  on  both  the  current  and  capital  accounts.  In   total, the current acco unt deficit is projected to widen  to  2.4%  of  GDP  this  year  and  3%  in  2006,  and  will   thus remain within sustainable bounds. Public finances   At  4.8%  of  GDP,  the  general  government  deficit  in   2004   is   estimated   to   be    considerably   lower   than    targeted  in  the  2004  b udget.  The  downward  revision  of   the   deficit   results   mainly   from   a   better-than- expected   performance   by   the   social   security   sub- sector   by   0.7%   of   GDP.   A   better-than-expected    position of the central gove rnment also contributed to  the revision of  the 2004 deficit.  The   general   government   deficit   is   expected   to    decrease  to  4.4%  of  GDP  in  2005  and  3.8%  in  2006   compared  to  3.9%  and  3.2%  of  GDP  respectively  in   the  December  convergence  programme.  The  upward   revision  of  the  deficit  pr ojections  by  0.3  percentage   points  in  2005  and  0.7  in   2006  compared  to  the   autumn  2004  forecasts  takes  into  account  the  state  of   implementation  of  the  public  finance  reform  package   provided  in  the  updated  programme.  However,  based   on  the  no-policy  change  assumption,  the  forecast   includes  only  the  measures  that  have  been  approved   by   Parliament.   Savings   on   the   expenditure   side    represent  approximately   0.6%  of  GDP  in  2005  and   0.5% in 2006. The estimated budgetary impact of the  measures  affecting  the  revenue  side  of  the  budget   (restructuring of the railways and coal mining sector)  corresponds  to  0.1%  of  GDP  in  2005  and  2006.  The   downward   revision   of   the   growth   rates   has   also    contributed   to   a   higher   deficit-to-GDP   ratio.   The    forecast  still  includes  the  surplus  of  the  second-pillar   funded  pension  funds,  which  is  expected  to  reach   approximately 2% of GDP in 2004 and 1.9% in 2005  and 2006, within the general government sector.  The  lower-than-expected  gross   debt  figure  in  2004  is   due  to  stronger-than-expected  nominal  GDP  growth,   favourable      valuation       effects      following      the       appreciation  of  the  zloty  and  higher-than-expected   privatisation  proceeds.  From  43.6%  of  GDP  in  2004,   the debt-to-GDP ratio would still increase to 46.8% in  2005 and reach 47.6% in 2006. 		
April/2005	Portugal	Gradual recovery and persistent budgetary imbalances 	Developments in 2004  After shrinking by 1.1% in 2003, real GDP gained 1%  in 2004, with a clear  rebound up to the middle of the  year  and  retrenchments  thereafter.  The  recovery  was   led  by  strong  internal  demand:  after  receding  in  the   previous  year,  private  consumption  was  lively  and   private investment recovered from the losses recorded  in 2002 and 2003. Exports were buoyant in particular  in  the  first  half  of  2004,   while  imports  grew  strongly   over  the  whole  year.  The  result  was  a  negative  net   contribution of the external  sector to GDP growth and  a sharp deterioration of th e trade balance.   Outlook for 2005 and 2006  Domestic   demand,   while   rem aining   the   principal    driver of growth in the coming two years, is projected  to  slow  down  somewhat  in   2005.  The  labour  market   prospects  are  not  expected   to  improve,  and  thus  the   momentum  of  private  consumption  observed  in  2004   may   abate   in   2005.   Moreover,   the   uncertainty    surrounding  fiscal  consolidation  seems  to  have  been   weighing    on    the    economy,    in    particular    on     investment.  The  foreign  se ctor  should  not  exert  a   major drag on economic gro wth: firstly, the slowdown  in the rise of labour costs and in inflation is expected  to help exports competitiv eness, although  in a context  of  a  somewhat  more  moderate  growth  of  exports   markets;  secondly,  in  2006,  ex ports  will  be  boosted   by  specific  developments  in   the  car  industry;  thirdly,   the projected cooling of in ternal demand will result in  lower  demand  for  imports.  Nevertheless,  a  negative   carry-over  from  the  second  half   of  2004  will  damper   average  growth  in  2005 .  All  in  all,  real  GDP  is   estimated  to  grow  by  1.1%  in  2005  and  to  accelerate   to 1.7% in 2006.  After the sharp increase in 2004, demand for imported  goods in 2005 an d 2006 is expected to be more in line  with    domestic    demand,    preventing    a    further     significant  deterioration  in   the  trade  balance.  At  the   same time, the services balance su rplus is expected to  continue rising.   Labour market, wages and prices  On  the  back  of  subdued  growth,  unemployment  rose   further in 2004 and may edge up to a rate close to 7%  in  2005.  However,  moderate  wage  rises  and  a  slower   upward drift in unit labour  costs should provide some  relief. Inflation   slackened   markedly    at   the   beginning   of    2004,  but  rebounded  towards  the  end  of  the  year  due   to higher energy  prices. In 2005 and  2006, the lagged  effects  of  low  wage  growth  and  the  significantly   negative  output  gap  should   rein  back  inflationary   pressure.  The  easing  on  prices  of  imported  basic   goods should also help to  curb inflation  in 2006.  Public finances  In 2004, the general government deficit stood at 2.9%  of GDP 1 . In spite of the stro ng fiscal revenue growth,  hikes  on  government  expenditure  held  back  progress   in budgetary conso lidation. To keep the deficit below  the reference value, th e authorities decid ed to transfer  to  the  government  sector  pen sion  liabilities  for  four   state-owned   enterprises,    in   exchange   of   payments    worth more than 2.2% of GD P. Without such one-off  operations, the general government deficit would have  largely exceeded 3% of GDP.   Large  public  finances  imbalances  are  projected  over   the  forecast  horizon.  In  2005,  the  corporate  tax  rate   cut  from  30  to  25%  will,   for  the  first  time,  exert  its   full  effects,  lowering  proceeds  by  around  0.4%  of   GDP.   On   the   expenditure   side,   public   consumption   is    expected  to  continue  growing  in  2005  in  real  terms,   albeit    less    than    GDP.    The    strong    growth    in     expenditure  on  social  tr ansfers,  in  excess  of  nominal  GDP, that has been observed for several years is, on a  no-policy  change  basis,  fo recast  to  continue,  mainly   driven   by   old-age   pension   entitlements   with   the    maturing   of   pension   schemes   and   the   lack   of    improvement on the labour market.  All  in  all,  the  government  deficit  in  both  2005  and   2006  is  forecast  to  be  well  above  the  3%  of  GDP   reference    value.    Last    October,    the    Portuguese     authorities stated their commitmen t to keep the deficit  at  or  below  3%  of  GDP  an d,  in  order  to  achieve  this   goal,  to  introduce  one-off  revenue-raising  measures.   One of those measures, namely a transfer of a pension  fund  to  the  government  sector,  worth  0.3%  of  GDP,   was  taken  on  board  in  the  current  forecast,  which   brings  the  estimated  government  deficit  for  2005  to   4.9%  of  GDP.  It  remains  to  be  seen  whether  the  new   government  which  took  office  on  12  March,  will   confirm  such  in tention.  The  2005   deficit  has  been   revised   upwards   compared   with   the   Commission    services autumn forecast mainly due to a significantly  lower economic growth and the withdrawal of a one- off operation with expected proceeds of 0.5% of GDP,  as Eurostat considered it as  a financial operation with  no impact on the deficit.   In 2006, the deficit is projected at 4.7% of GDP on a  no-policy  change  assumption  and  abstracting  from   any one-off revenue-raising measure.  Since  2003,  public  debt  has  been  exceeding  60%  of   GDP.  As  a  consequence  of  the  high  government   deficits,  low  nominal  GDP   growth,  and  of  one-off   debt-increasing  stock-flow  adj ustments,  public  debt   will  continue  to  increase,  exceeding  68%  of  GDP  at   the end of 2006. 		
April/2005	Slovenia	Strong growth fuelled by exports	The economy in 2004  Following subdued activity in  2003, which resulted in  real GDP to grow at the slowest pace since 1993, the  economy  recovered  its  stren gth  in  2004.  As  growth   accelerated vigorously and in the third quarter of 2004  reached  the  highest  rate  over  the  past  four  years,   output   is   estimated   to   have   risen   by   4.6%.   The    stimulus    came    from    a    favourable    international     environment. Ignited by a recovery of the EU markets  at  the  end  of  2003,  exports  expanded  considerably   throughout 2004. After a long period of external trade  being    a    drag    on    economic    performance,    the     contribution  of  net  exports   to  GDP  growth  turned   positive  in  the  second  half  of  2004.  Furthermore,   household    spending    and    investment    expenditure     remained   buoyant   while    de-stocking   occurred.   A    marked  upward  trend  in  the  quarterly  dynamics  of   both   domestic   and   foreign   demand   confirms   the    anticipation of a solid econom ic revival in  2004-2006.  The  force  of  the  upturn,   however,  appears  strong   given the rather slim prospect s of further expansion in  the rest of the EU.   Outlook for 2005-2006  This    year,    the    economy    is    likely    to    become     temporarily  affected  by  relatively  slow  growth  in   Slovenia’s   main   trading   part ners.   It   is   especially    domestic  consumption  that  is  likely  to  fuel  growth.   While  wages  are  expected  to  remain  constrained,  the   historically  low  nominal  in terest  rates  and  the  new   personal   income   tax   regi me   relieving   the   lowest    income  classes  should  keep  private  spending  strong.   The forecast projects GDP to increase by 3.7%.   In  2006,  when  the  negative  effects  of  high  oil  prices   are   expected   to   gradually   fade,   growth   should    strengthen, to reach 4.0%. Domestic demand is set to  provide  the  main  impetus  as  household  spending  and   investment  stay  robust   against  the  background  of   vigorous construction activity  and production capacity  adjustments geared to bu ilding up the competitiveness  of  Slovene  industry.  As  a  consequence  of  buoyant   private and investment expenditure a sustained rise in  imports  is  expected,  which  is  likely  to  be  offset  by   solid     export     growth.     The     negative     external      contribution  to  GDP  growth  should  thus  gradually   narrow.  Although  a  recovery  in  the   main  trading  partners  has   been  fuelling  Slovenia’s  ex ports,  the  current  account   moved  further  from  balance  in  2004.  Over  the  next   two years, the current  account deficit should stay low  and contained, at 1% of GDP.  Labour market, wages and prices  In  2004,  the  situation  on  the  labour  market  improved   as     employment     increased     and     unemployment      decreased. This year, when a further gentle pick-up in  employment  is  projected,  the  unemployment  rate  is   expected  to  resume  its  gradual  trend  decline  and  be   around 6% by 2006.   In 2004, real wage growth has been subdued thanks to  the  implementation  of  the  restrictive  wage  agreement   across the economy. The forward-looking indexation,  taking   into   account   an ticipated   rather   than   actual    domestic  consumer  price  movements,  inflation  in  the   EU and the euro/tolar central pa rity, has been applied  consistently    in    all    sector s,    public    and    private.     Furthermore,   the   wage   increases   lagged   behind    productivity  growth  by  mo re  than  on e  percentage   point.   Inflation  continued  to  decline  rapidly  in  2004,  only   briefly  interrupted  by  the  oil  price  hike  and  higher   excise   duties   on   tobacco   in   May   and   November    respectively.  Consumer  price  growth  dropped  from   5.7%  in  2003  to  3.6%  in   2004. Inflationary pressures  have  been  well  contained  as  the  government  has   remained    committed    to     prudence    in    regulating     administered price increases and indirect tax changes,  as  well  as  has  applied  frequent  adjustments  of  excise   duties  on  oil  to  temper  th e  impact  of  world  market   price   fluctuations.   Moreover,   inflation   has   been    falling against a stable exchange rate, set at the central parity  of  239.640  tolars  pe r  1  euro  with  a  standard   fluctuation band of +/- 15 pe rcent in the framework of  ERM  II  on  28  June.  This  halted  a  long  period  of   continuous depreciation against the euro and the tolar  has remained very stable ever since.   With  exchange  rate  stability   now  credibly  anchoring   expectations,  inflation  is  projected  to  further  decline   based   on   the   continu ation   of   prudent   policies,    administering regulated pri ces  and  indirect  taxes,  and   the  reconfirmation  of  wage  moderation  beyond  2005   in  the  negotiations  between   the  social  partners  due   this year.   Public finances  The  revision  of  the  government  accounts,  linked  to   the  reclassification  of  the  two  extra-budgetary  funds   into  the  general  government  sector,  has  led  to  the   general   government   defici t   figures   being   revised    upwards  (by  0.2-0.5%  of  GDP)  for  the  period  2000- 2003. Within the new methodological framework, the  deficit in 2004 is estimated  to have decreased slightly,  to 1.9% of GDP, mostly as a result of good economic  performance   and   a   firm   commitment   to   fiscal    discipline in the wake of a revenue shortfall linked to  the loss in VAT resour ces following the change of the  tax  collection  system  after  EU  accession  which  was,   moreover, smaller than expected. This year, the deficit  is  projected  to  increase  to  2.2%  of  GDP  as  the   revenue  ratio  declines  furt her  due  to  the  direct  tax   reform   effective   from   January   2005.   The   current    forward-looking   indexatio n   mechanism,   containing    the  rise  of  public  sector  wages  and  certain  social   transfers,    will    limit    the    rise    in    expenditures.     Anticipating  the  increase  in  th e  inflows  of  EU  funds,   the deficit is forecast to stabilise at slightly above 2%  of GDP.  		
April/2005	Slovakia	Domestic demand drives growth 	Economic situation in 2004   In 2004, real GDP growth accelerated significantly to  5½%  and  its  composition  turned  around  completely.   Domestic  demand  became  the  sole  growth  engine,   while   the   external   contribu tion   entered   negative    territory.  Although  export  growth  remained  in  the   double-digit  range,  it  dropp ed  to  approximately  half   the  level  of  its  stellar  performance  a  year  earlier  and   was outpaced by import growth. Higher imports were  induced  by  an  expansion   of  both  investment  and   private  consumption,  which  had  both  contracted  a   year    before.    In    particular,    private    consumption     expenditure picked up faster than had been commonly  expected  and  was  bolstered  by  real  wage  growth  and   lower  income  taxes  (comp ensating  for  restraints  on   social  transfers).  Changes  in  income  taxation  also   caused  economic  agents  to  shift  some  components  of   employees’ compensation from 2003 into 2004.   Prospects in 2005  and 2006   In   2005   and   2006,   the   economic   expansion   is    anticipated  to  remain  robu st  at  around  5%.  Domestic   demand  is  likely  to  stay  th e  exclusive  driving  force   behind     growth,     while     the     negative     external      contribution   is   forecast   to   peak   in   2005.   Private    consumption  growth  is  expected  to  accelerate  further   as  disposable  income  expands  (reflecting  higher  real   wages) and as the household savi ngs rate falls (net of  the  effect  of  the  introduction  of  a  funded  pension   pillar).   Strengthening   house hold   credit   growth   is    likely  to  have  a  consumption-inducing  effect  as  well.   Gross  fixed  capital  formation  is  predicted  to  expand   sharply    as    business    environment    and    business     confidence   are   being   fostered   further   and   as   the    already         pledged         gree nfield         investments,          predominantly in the  automobile sector, materialise.   However,  the  latter  will  also   entail  an  increase  in   imports of investment goods and this is a major factor  behind the expected negative  external contribution. In  2006,  the  first  tranches  of  the  newly  created  export   capacity  will  come  on  stream  but  will  prospectively   not  yet  suffice  for  the  ex ternal  contributio n  to  turn   positive again.   In  2004,  the  current  account   deficit  widened  to  some   3½%    of    GDP.    This    resulted     mainly    from    a     weakening,  but  still  robu st,  export  performance  and   strong  import  growth.  Furthermore,  the  amount  of   repatriated  profits  increased   significantly.  This  trend,   coupled  with  a  continued  high  import  expansion,  are   the main factors behind a forecast additional increase  in  the  current  account  deficit  to  some  5%  of  GDP  in   2005 and 2006.   Labour market, costs and prices  After  a  strong  performa nce  in  2003,  employment   growth was significantly lower in 2004, not least as a  result  of  further  labour  shed ding  in  the  public  sector.   Employment  growth  is  predicted  to  revive  in  2005   and  2006.  Partly  as  a  refl ection  of  unemployment   benefit  reforms,  the  unemployment  rate  fell  strongly   in 2003. It rose again in 2004  but a further, albeit only  gradual,   reduction   is   likely    over   the   rest   of   the    forecast horizon.   In  2004,  the  average  consumer  price  inflation  rate   amounted  to  7½%,  with  adjustments  in  administered   prices   and   indirect   taxes   contributing   about   5¾    percentage  points.  As  these   adjustments  will  play  a   much lesser role in futu re, inflation is forecast to drop  rapidly  to  below  4%  and  3%  in  2005  and  2006   respectively  –  assuming  th at  potential  second-round   effects,   including   due   to   backward-looking   wage-    setting, are kept in check.  Public finances  The implementation of the 20 04 budget reflected most  of  the  government’s  structural  reform  agenda  for  the   current  legislative  period,  on  both  the  revenue  and   expenditure     side.     This     included     notably     the      introduction of a flat corporate and individual income  tax rate and a uniform VAT rat e (both at 19%) at the  beginning      of      2004.      It      also      encompassed      comprehensive    reforms    in    the    social    sphere.     Altogether,  the  budget  de ficit  turned  ou t  significantly   better  than  originally  planned,   but  this  is  mostly  due   to  spending  postponements,  including  related  to  co- payments    for    EU-funds.    The    overall    general     government  deficit  for  2004  is  estimated  at  3.3%  of   GDP.   For the years 2005 and 2006, the general government  deficit  is  expected  to  be  slightly  below  or  at  4%  of   GDP. A rise in both the revenue- and expenditure-to- GDP-ratios  in  2005  is  due   to  the  assumed  increased   inflow  of  transfers  from  the  EU  on  the  revenue  side   and    to    the    associated    spending    (including    co- financing)  and  the  contributions  to  the  EU  budget  on   the expenditure side.   On  the  revenue  side,  after  the  major  shift  from  direct   to indirect taxation associated with the tax reforms in  2004,  changes  in  the  tax  legislation  in  2005  are   marginal  and  it  is  assumed  that  policies  will  not   change  in  2006.  Social  contributions  in  2005  and   2006  are  particularly  affected  by  the  redirection  of   contributions in the amount  of 9 percentage points of  gross  wages  to  a  funded   pension  pillar.  The  effect  is   forecast to be around ½% of GDP in 2005 and around  1%   of   GDP   in   2006    and   is   excluded   from   the    predicted social contribution revenues.   On  the  expenditure  side,  the  main  reform  measure   included  in  the  budget  2005  is  a  second  tranche  of   health  care  reforms,  which  is   predicted  to  lead  to  an   upfront increase of the GDP-shar e of expenditures by  health insurance companies in 20 05 but a stable share  thereafter.    		
April/2005	Finland	Despite some easing, activity to remain robust 	The economy in 2004   Economic  growth  turned  ou t  higher  than  expected,   with  real  GDP  accelerating  to  3.7%  from  2.4%  in   2003.  Domestic  demand  provided  the  main  bulk  of   support, as the contribution from external demand was  negative    on    the    year.    Also    higher    inventories     contributed    to    growth.    Household    consumption,     fuelled by solid earnings, dir ect and indirect tax cuts,  and   low   interest   rates,   grew   by   3.2%.   Public    consumption  expanded  by   2.1%  from  2003.  Total   investment  reversed  its  declining  trend  and  advanced   for the first time since 2 001, up by 4.6%. Residential  construction   and   equipm ent   investment   increased    strongly,  while  investment   on  commercial  buildings   continued  to  decline.  Even  though  being  boosted  by   strong demand for metal products, exports in the first  half  of  2004  were  weak  reflecting  difficulties  in  the   electronics   industry.   As   the   year   progressed,   the    telecommunications   sector   was   able   to   win   back    market shares and increase exports, while demand for  metal  products  also  remained  strong.  The  growth   contribution  from  net  exports  was  negative  at  0.1  for   the  whole  year,  as  exports  and  imports  increased  by   3.5%  and  4.8%,  respectively.  The  weakening  in  the   terms  of  trade  continued,  even  though  export  prices   reversed their d eclining trend and increased modestly,  as  import  prices  rose  strongly  due  to  higher  oil  and   raw material prices.  In  line  with  strong  activ ity,  employment  started  to   improve  in  the  second  half   of  2004,  offsetting  earlier   declines. However, employment was unchanged from  2003.  Nevertheless,  the  un employment  rate  fell  as   part   of   unemployed   left   the   labour   force.   HICP    inflation declined from an aver age of 1.3% in 2003 to  0.1%  in  2004,  reflecting   increased  competition  and   alcohol tax cuts, which took effect in March.   Prospects for 2005 and 2006   Despite some moderation, the economy is projected to  remain  firmly  on  the  growth   path  throughout  the   forecast   period.   According   to   survey   indicators,    growth   of   industrial   production   and   exports   is    expected  to  moderate  slightly  in  early  2005,  while   domestic  demand  should  remain  solid.  Net  exports   will  increasingly  contribute  to  growth,  while  support   from private consumption will recede, but investment  is expected to pick up th e slack. Hence, activity is set  to expand at a steady pace, reaching 3.3% in 2005 and  then easing to slightly below 3% in 2006.   In  the  labour  market,  the   improvement  which  started   in the summer of 2004  is expected to continue. Higher  job  creation  during  the  forecast  period  will  make   inroads    into    unemplo yment,    which    nevertheless     remains     largely     structural     in     nature.     Private      consumption  is  expected  to  continue  to  provide  the   main stimulus to activity, altho ugh gains in disposable  income  will  be  lower  as  the  temporary  factors  that   supported  purchasing  power  in  2004  fade  away.  In   addition, higher inflation, in creases in tax-like charges  and  moderate  pay  rises  will  dampen  growth  of  real   disposable income. Public co nsumption is expected to  grow by around 2% annually, despite the efforts of the  central   government   at   expenditure   control.   After    peaking in 2004, investment  is expected to continue to  grow  in  2005-2006,  despite   some  slowdown  due  to   less    lively    housing    construction    and    Finnish     companies increasingly invest abroad.   Exports  are  anticipated  to  further  strengthen  on  the   back  of  stable  international   environment,  retaining   their  momentum  also  in  2006.  After  winning  back   market  shares  in  the  electronics  industry  in  2004,  the   prospects     for     export s     of     telecommunication      equipment  appear  promising.  Also,  the  outlook  for   metal    industry    exports    remains    positive,    given     continued  strong  demand  from  Asian  countries  and   Russia.  Despite  suffering  from   low  sales  prices,  the   paper industry is expected to remain competitive.  Labour market, costs and prices  After  very  benign  HICP   inflation  of  0.1%  in  2004,   due to alcohol tax cuts of  33% on average, inflation is expected to normalise as the effect of the tax cut fades  away  and  reach  about  1.1%  and  1.4%  in  2005  and   2006,  respectively.  In  late  20 04,  the  social  partners   settled   a   new   centralised    two-and-half-year   wage    agreement  that  provides  fo r  wage  rises  of  2.5%  from   March  2005  for  15  months,  and  another  2.1%  from   June 2006 for 16 months . Assuming the usual positive  wage  drift  of  about  1  perc entage  point,  per-capita   wages are expected to incr ease by about 3.5% in 2005  and 3% in 2006, from 3.5% in 2004. However, higher  growth  in  overall  productivity   appears  likely  to  curb   the rise in unit labour costs.  Public finances   The  general  government  surpl us  is  foreseen  to  be   reduced from 2.1% of GDP in 2004 to 1.6% by 2006.  Central government finances  are expected to slip into  deficit,  after  posting  a  sur plus  of  0.4%  of  GDP  in   2004, while the financial po sition of local government  is  foreseen  to  weak en  and  remain  in   deficit.  On  the   basis   of   the   government’s   medium-term   spending    guidelines of spring 2005 and the budget for 2005, the  general government surplus is  estimated to stay below  2%   of   GDP   during   the   forecast   period.   Central    government  finances  are  projected  to  be  in  deficit  in   2005-2006,  since  the  gove rnment  has  supplemented   the collective wage agreement by sizeable income tax  cuts  of  0.8%  of  GDP  and  due  to  higher  overall   expenditure.  Local  government  finances  will  stay  in   deficit   due   to   higher   spending   and   investment    expenditure even though tax receipts should improve.  Overall,  the  general  government  surplus  will  rest   solely on the su rplus in the social security funds.  The  government  debt  ratio   is  anticipated  to  fall  from   45.1%  of  GDP  in  2004  to   43.7%  of  GDP  by  the  end   of the forecast period. 		
April/2005	Sweden	Domestic demand takes the lead 	The situation in 2004  Swedish  economic  growth  was  strong  in  2004,  with   GDP  up  by  3.5%  on  the   year,  compared  to  1.5%  in   2003.  The  calendar  effect   contributed  positively  but,   even  adjusting  for  this,  growth   was  above  potential.   Exports  expanded  substan tially,  outpacing  imports,   resulting  in  a  considerable   growth  contribution  from   net    exports.    On    the    domestic    side,    private     consumption  advanced  steadily  and  the  expansion  of   investment  was  encouraging   after  a  sustained  period   of  sluggishness.  The  rela tively  poor  developments   observed in the labour market  helped to contain wage  demands and inflationary pressures, which have been  very  low,  allowing  the  Riksban k  to  cut  repo  rates  by   75 basis points over the year.   The situation in 2005 and 2006  Recent  indicators  are  positive,  with  both  consumer   and    business    expectations    at     high    levels.    The     consumer   confidence   indica tor,   and   in   particular    consumers’     expectations     regarding     their     own      economic  situation,  give  a   positive  pictur e.  Both  the   industrial  confidence  and  the  purchasing  managers   indicators   show   positive    expectations.   These   are    expected  to  support  a  continuation  of  healthy  growth   in  2005.  Domestic  demand  growth  should  become   stronger and external demand  growth continue at high  levels,  albeit  at  a  decelerating  pace,  while  imports   should  pick  up  further   during  2005,  resulting  in  a   continued  small  but  positiv e  contribution  from  net   exports.  In  2006,  economic  growth  is  expected  to   decelerate  toward  potential  levels,  as  the  recovery   becomes   more   balanced   throug hout   the   economy.    Overall,  GDP  is  expected  to  grow  by  3.0%  in  2005   and 2.8% in 2006.   A  resumption  of  employment  growth  will  contribute   positively  to  household  disposable  income  in  2005   and  2006  while  the  sav ings  rate  stabilises  at  around   11%.   Financial   wealth   has    benefited   from   rising    equity prices. Moreover, while households have taken  on  more  debt,  house  prices  have  continued  to  rise   steadily  against  a  backgr ound  of  low  interest  rates,   contributing  to  the  ma intenance  of  a  relatively  strong   net  wealth  position  of  households.  All  in  all,  this   should  result  in  an  increasi ng  growth  in  consumption   in  the  years  to  2006.  Public  consumption  is  expected   to  continue  to  be  relatively  steady  over  the  forecast   period.   Turning to investment, th e conditions for a continued  recovery  are  in  place:  a  benign  demand  outlook,   favourable  financing  conditions,  a  long  period  of   falling  total  investments  in   previous  years  and  a  high   capacity  utilisation  rate  in  manufacturing.  A  strong   investment expansion should therefore take place over  the forecast period.   Exports  are  expected  to   continue  to  grow  relatively   strongly up to 2006, in lin e with world markets, but at  a  decelerating  pace  as  the  appreciation  of  the  krona   feeds through. Imports should expand as final demand  strengthens further during the forecast period.   Labour market, costs and prices  Employment  fell  in  2004  and  the  unemployment  rate   rose.  The  strong  rise  in  economic  activity  foreseen   from   2004   onwards   is   expected   to   result   in   an    improvement  in  the  labour  market  in  2005  and  in   particular   in   2006.   Agai nst   this   background   and    supported  by  an  increase  in  the  volume  of  active   labour  market  measures,  the  unemployment  rate  will   decrease    over    the    period.    Inflation    has    fallen     considerably    since    electricity    and    energy    price     increases     in     late     2003,     notwithstanding     the      considerable  recent  rises  in  oil  prices.  Wages  are   expected  to  rise  relatively  moderately,  reflecting  past   weakness  in  the  labour  market.  The  wage  agreement   reached  in  the  spring  of  2004,  covering  a  period   including  2006,  resulted   in  lower  nego tiated  wage   rises   in   industry   compared   with   the   2001   wage    negotiation     round.     Against     this     background,      inflationary  pressures  shoul d  continue  to  be  subdued.   As  demand  and  growth  revives  further  in  2005  and  2006,  inflation  is  expected  to  rise  gradually  towards   2%  in  the  course  of   2006.  With  relatively  strong   growth  over  this  period,  and  an  improvement  in  the   labour market from next year,  interest rates may start  to rise.  Public finances  In  2004,  the  su rplus  in  public   finances  was  slightly   above  1%  of  GDP.  Over  the  forecast  period,  Sweden   will  continue  to  show  b udget  surpluses  while  the   fiscal  stance  is  broadly  ne utral.  Income  tax  cuts  in   2005 proposed in the Budget Bill, one part of the last  step  of  a  phased  income  tax  reform,  will  reduce  the   surplus ratio in the govern ment finances somewhat in  2005  as  compared  to  2004.  On  current  policies,  the   budget  balance  is  projected  to  remain  at  a  similar   level in 2006, benefiting  also from an improvement in  the  labour  market.  General  government  debt,  which   mainly  lies  with  cen tral  government,  is  projected  to   rise  as  central  government  is  expected  to  remain  in   deficit   over   the   forecast   period.   The   increase   is    nevertheless   slower   than   nominal   GDP   over   the    forecast  period,  resulting  in  a  fall  in  the  debt  ratio  to   just below 50% of GDP in 2006. 		
April/2005	United Kingdom	Wind in the sails 	The economy in 2004  Overall,  UK  GDP  growth  in  2004  has  been  firm  and   above  trend,  at  3.1%  for  the  year  as  a  whole.  Strong   growth  in  the  first  half  of  the  year  slowed  slightly  in   the  second  half,  broadly  in  line  with  the  Commission   services’   autumn   forecast.   Fourth   quarter   output    growth is estimated to have been 0.7%, representing a  slight  pickup  up  on  third  quarter  growth  of  0.5%.   Nonetheless,   the   data   appear   to   suggest   that   the    economy has moderated towards trend.  Domestic   demand   growth,   up   4%   over   the   year,    continues  to  be  the  key  driver  for  this  performance.   Private   consumption   expenditure   slowed   over   the    course  of  the  year,  most  likely  as  a  consequence  of  a   sustained    tightening    in    monetary    policy    and     moderation in house price inf lation. Helping to offset  this, supportive governmen t consumption picked up in  the  second  half  of  2004,  as  part  of  the  government’s   continued programme of spending aimed at improving  public  services.  Growth  in   fixed  investment,  at  6.0%   for 2004 as a whole, also contributed.   Net trade, in contrast, continued to act as a significant  drag   on   growth.   The   appreciation   in   the   sterling    effective exchange rate that had taken place during the  second  half  of  2003  and   into  March  2004  initially   dampened  the  potential  ex ternal  stimulus,  but  the   subsequent   depreciation   in   the   late-summer   and    autumn  helped  support  export  growth,  which  had   begun to pick up in the second quarter. Countered by  increasingly   firm   growth   in    import   volumes,   the    overall negative contributio n to growth was 0.9% over  the year.  In  2004,  as  in  2003,  growth  was  led  by  the  service   sectors,  particularly  business  services  and  finance,   with   firm   support   from   the   construction   sector.    Manufacturing output growth  was less steady – a fall  in  output  was  evid ent  in  both  th e  first  and  third   quarters, but the sector still reco rded growth (of 1.3%)  for   the   year   as   a   whole.   Output   in   this   sector,    however, remains below its 2001 level.    Unemployment   has   remained   close   to   record-low    levels, at 4.7% in the three months to January 2005. In  spite  of  this  labour  mark et  strength,  average  earnings   grew  only  slightly  faster  th an  the  previous  year,  and   do not yet appear to have give n rise to any significant  inflationary pressure. Indeed, the harmonised index of  consumer prices (known in the UK as CPI) remained  well below the Bank of England ’s 2% inflation target  throughout  the  year.  Hav ing  raised  policy  interest   rates   by   a   cumulative   125   basis   points   between    November  2003  and  August   2004  in  anticipation  of   emerging  price  pressures,  the  Bank  has  since  left   interest rates unchanged.    Prospects for 2005 and 2006  Firm  growth  is  expected  to   continue  throughout  the   forecast period, moderating slightly to around 2¾% in  both  2005  and  2006.  Final  domestic  demand  should   weaken  in  2005  and  2006,  particularly  as  household   consumption slows as a consequence of the tightening  in monetary policy already und ertaken, but this should  be partially offset by an improved export performance  as global demand remains firm.   The   cumulative   rise   in    interest   rates   to   date   is    expected  to  lead  to  moderate  household  consumption  		
November/2005	Belgium	A slow economic recovery 	 Activity in 2005  In  2005,  the  economic  slowdown  that  had  started  at   the  end  of  2004  turned  out  to  be  more  severe  than   anticipated.   Real   GDP   growth   almost   came   to   a    standstill in the first quarter and remained moderate in  the  second  quarter,  mainly   as  a  result  of  declining   exports.  For  the  last  two  quarters  a  real  growth  of   0.4%  is  expected,  mainly  due  to  increased  external   demand.  Overall,  GDP  growth  in  2005  is  forecast  at   1.4%.   Despite  the  recovery  in  the  balance  of  trade  expected   for  the  second  half  of  th e  year,  external  demand  is   likely to have a negative impact on economic growth  in   2005.   Moreover,   cont inuous   weak   consumer    confidence,  fuelled  by  the  recent  turmoil  in  the  oil   markets and uncertainty regarding the ongoing debate  on  pensions  and  early  retirement,  could  also  dampen   consumption.  Investment   was  exceptionally  strong  in   the  first  half  of  the  year  despite  decreasing  business   confidence,  possibly  because  of  some  catching-up     after low investments in  previous years. In the second  half of the year, investment  is expected to slow down  somewhat  and,  following  a  recent  improvement  in   business confidence, settle at an average rate of 4.9%  for 2005.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  From   2006   onwards,   some   economic   recovery   is    expected, albeit at a moderate GDP growth rate close  to    2%.  While  exports  shou ld  continue  to  recover  in   2006,  consumption  will  b enefit  from  stronger  growth   in  gross  disposab le  income  resulting   from  the  final   stage   of   the   2001   direct   tax   reform   and   some    improvement    in    employment.    After    decreasing     continuously since 2002, the household saving rate is  expected  to  stabilise  around   12.3%.  On  the  other   hand,   growth   in   government   consumption   should    remain  moderate,  especially  in   2006,  in  view  of  the   government’s  efforts  required  to  reach  its  budgetary   targets.  Gross  capital  formation  is  forecast  to  remain   strong in 2006, mainly driven by public investment by  local   authorities   in    the   run-up   to   th e   2006   local    elections.  However,  following  the  pattern  that  has   been  observed  in  the  past,  public   investment  in  2007   should  decrease  markedly.  On  the  other  hand,  the   anticipated  recovery  of  external  markets  and  some   improvement   in   consum ption   expenditure   should    continue  to  stimulate  priva te  investment,  which  is   expected  to  remain  reasonably   solid  throughout  the   forecast period.    Labour market, costs and prices  In  the  first  half  of  2005 ,  the  Belgian  labour  market   benefited  from  the  strong   economic  growth  observed   in  2004,  but  lost  momentum   towards  the  second  half   of  the  year.  Higher  economic   growth  and  efforts  to   reduce  the  tax  burden  on  labour  should  revive  job   creation  from  2006  onward s,  but  its  effect  on  the   unemployment  rate  remains  limited  due  to  a  growing   labour force. Moreover, the  cumulative nominal wage  increase  of  4.5%  for  2005-2006  foreseen  in  the  latest   wage  agreement  will  probably   be  exceeded,  which   will also have an adverse effect on the labour market.   In 2005, the CPI is expected  to increase by 2.8%. The  inflationary effect of risi ng oil prices has been slightly  offset  by  some  compensating  tax  measures  in  the   second  half  of  the  year.  However,  because  some  of   these measures only reduce prices in 2005 and due to  inflationary pressure st emming from increased wages,  inflation  could  still  reach  2.7%  in  2006,  but  should   fall again afterwards. Public finances  In 2005, despite the economic slowdown, tax revenue  remained  on  track  and  reforms  in  the  health  sector   helped to keep health  care expenditure in  line with the  4.5%  real  growth  target  (a gainst  an  overrun  of  7.8%   in    2004).    Therefore    government    accounts    are     expected  to  reach  a  position  close  to  balance.  For   2006  a  deficit  of  0.3%  of  GDP  can  be  expected,   against a balanced budget foreseen in the 2006 budget .  The  difference  is  mainly  due  to  less  optimistic   assumptions    on    government    expenditure,    lower     estimates  for  the  proceeds  of  a  fiscal  regularisation   measure as well as for some new tax measures, and an  expected  loss  in  income  linked  to  the  sale  of  tax   arrears  in  2005.  In  2007  the  government  balance  is   expected  to  further  deteriorate  due  to  a  substantial   package  of  one-off  measures  in  the  2006  budget   (some 0.5% of GDP) and reductions in social security  contributions  (close  to  0.2%).  On  the  other  hand,   public  finances  will  benefit  from  a  normalisation  of   spending  by  local  authorities  after  the  local  elections   (over  0.2%  of  GDP)  and  lower  interest  payments   (0.1%). Therefore, on a  no-policy-change basis and in  the  absence  of  new  one-off  receipts  a  deficit  of  over   0.5% of GDP is forecast.   In 2005, the debt reduction  has been slowed down by  the  assumption  of  a  2.5%  of  GDP  debt  from  the   national  railway  company.  Overall,  as  a  result  of   sustained   budgetary    efforts   and   declin ing   interest    expenditure  the  debt  ratio  remains  on  a  downward   path  (see  graph  3.1).  By  the  end  of  the  forecast   horizon,  the  debt  ratio  is   expected  to  fall  well  below   90%. 		
November/2005	czech Republic	Strong growth fuelled by vigorous exports 	Activity in 2005  The  performance  of  the  Czech  economy  remained   strong in the first half of  2005, with growth increasing  to  4.9%  year-on-year,  the   highest  growth  rate  since   1996.  Economic  activ ity  was  driven  mainly  by  net   exports     which     in creased     substantially.     Private      consumption   accelerated,   but   remained   subdued.    Public  consumption  continued  to  fall  and  growth  of   gross   fixed   capital   formation   decelerated.   Robust    economic  activity  is  expected  to  continue  for  the  rest   of  2005,  leading  to  an  annual  growth  rate  of  about   4¾%.  Strong  economic  pe rformance  will  be  mainly   due to vigorous exports.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  In   2006   and   2007,   the   economic   expansion   is    projected  to  remain  strong,  but  to  decelerate  to  some   4½% in 2006 and 4¼% in 2007. Although net exports  are  expected  to  continue  to  be  an  important  driving   force of GDP growth, domestic demand is expected to  strengthen.  Private  demand   will  be  stimulated  by  an   improving  labour  market  situation  and  investment  by   higher    utilisation    of    EU    structural    funds    and     favourable  financial  conditions.  Public  consumption   will accelerate, though only slightly.  Vigorous     exports     resulted     in     a     significant      improvement  of  the  trade  balance  and  a  substantial   narrowing    of    the    current    account    deficit.    The     developments in the external sector are forecast to be  positive.   Vigorous   export   growth   boosted   by   EU    accession  should  continue,  though  at  a  slower  pace.   The     trade     balance     is     expected     to     improve      substantially,  reaching  a  surplus  for  the  first  time   since  1991.  Czech  ex ports  seem  to  be  profiting  from   the   German   export   boom   and   strong   growth   in    Slovakia  (the  second  biggest  export  market),  as  well   as  gaining  new  markets   to  the  east.  As  a  result,  the   current  account  deficit   should  decline  from  5.2%  of   GDP  in  2004  to  less  than   3%  in  2005.   The  positive   trend in the external sector is projected to continue. In  2007, the trade balance surplus is forecast to be about  3%  of  GDP  and  the  current  account  deficit  should   shrink to some 2¼% of GDP.  Labour market, costs and prices  Strong  economic  performance  helped  improve  the   situation  in  the  labour  market.  The  trend  of  falling   employment     was     reversed     and     the     rate     of      unemployment   began   to   fall,   reaching   about   8%.    Employment is projected to increase over the forecast  horizon.  The  rate  of  unemployment  is  forecast  to  fall   continuously  from  8.3%  in  2004  to  about  7½%  in   2007, mainly thanks to  strong economic growth.  Due to the ongoing appreciation of the koruna, strong  competition,  falling  food  prices  and  favourable  base   effects, average annual HICP inflation was only 1.3%  in the first half of 2005.  Since the beg inning of 2005,  inflation  has  been  below  the  target  band  set  by  the   monetary   authorities.   As   a   consequence   of   high    energy  prices,  inflation   is  likely  to  increase  towards   the  end  of  2005  and  in   the  first  half  of  2006.  A   temporary  overshooting  of  th e  upper  limit  of  the   inflation  target  is  expected.  However,  average  HICP   inflation  is  projected  to  remain  low  in  2005  (1¾%).   Acceleration  to  almost  3%  is  foreseen  in  2006  and   future  inflation  development  will  largely  depend  on   the  reaction  of  wages  to  increased  energy  prices.   Assuming  relatively  weak  second-round  effects,  the   inflation  rate  is  forecast  to  be  slightly  below  the   monetary  policy  target  in  2007  (CPI  inflation  of  3%   year on year +/-1 pp since 2006).  Public finances  Forecasting  public  finances  has  become  complicated   since the spending ministries  gained the possibility of  rolling  over  unspent  funds   from  previous  budgetary   years. Last year, the unspent  funds amounted to about  1%  of  GDP.  This  creates  uncertainty  about  when   those  funds  will  be  accumulated  and  when  they  will   be spent. Over the first ten months of 2005, budgetary revenues  have  been  higher  than  expected,  mainly  due  to  very   strong  economic  growth.  At  the  same  time,  under- execution  of  expenditures   is  likely  to  be  repeated.   Given the very positive cash  developments in the state  budget,   the   total   budgetary    outcome   in   2005   is    expected to again be better than expected. The general  government deficit is forecast to reach about 3¼% of  GDP,  compared  with  the  convergence  programme   target of 4.7% of GDP. The projected deficit includes  two  major  one-off  expen ditures  (financial  leasing  of   military   jets   and   alleviation   of   foreign   debt)   and    assumes  that  the  expenditure  rolled  over  from  2004   will be fully spent, but new saving s of about 1½ % of  GDP may be realised.  The  2006  deficit  is  projected  to  reach  3¾%  of  GDP,   under  the  assumption  that  about  1%  of  GDP  on  the   expenditure  side  will  be  ag ain  rolled  ove r  into  2007.   Despite      the      planned      nominal      medium-term       expenditure  ceilings  being  overs hot  in  the  2006  draft   budget, higher spending will  be financed by budgetary  revenues   generated   by   strong   economic   growth.    Given  ongoing  good  economic  performance  and  a   record  of  prudent  b udgetary  policy,  the  deficit  of   3¼%  of  GDP  in  2007  is   within  reach.  However,  the   structural  budgetary  balance  is  forecast  to  worsen  in   both 2005 and 2006.  Gross  public  debt  is  e xpected  to  slightly  decrease  in   2005 to 36¼% of GDP, main ly thanks to privatisation  proceeds.  In  2006  and  2007,  government  debt  is   projected to slightly increase. 		
November/2005	Denmark	An economy in excellent shape on most scores 	The recovery of economic activity in Denmark which  took  hold  in  2004  has  continued  in  2005.  After  a   hesitant first quarter, GDP growth was very strong in  the  second  quarter,  with  the  economy  growing  at  a   yearly  rate  of  more  than  2½%  in  the  first  half  of  the   year.  Private  consumption  continues  to  be  the  main   engine  of  growth.  Consumption  is  boosted  by  real   disposable  income  gains,   a  booming  housing  market,   falling    unemployment    and    low    interest    rates.     Consumers    have,    it    seems,    not    been    overly     discouraged  by  high  fuel   prices  and  car  sales  in   particular  remain  buoyant.  Public  consumption  grew   by 2% in real terms in 2004  and is expected to expand  in  excess  of  the  government’s  0.5%  objective  also  in   2005.  Fixed  investment  reboun ded  vigorously  in  the   second    quarter,    with    investment    in    equipment     expanding  at  a  two-digit   rate.  Investment  has  been   growing irregularly in recent quarters but seems to be  on  an  upward  trend.  Export s  also  grew  very  strongly   in  the  second  quarter,  in  spite  of  subdued  growth  in   the   euro   area,   Denmark’s   main   export   market.    However,  the  impact  on  GDP  growth  was  cancelled   out by a rise in imports of a similar magnitude.  Recent trends are expected to continue during the rest  of  the  year.  Backed  by  strong  consumer  confidence,   private consumption growth is set to be even stronger  than  in  2004  (4.1%).  As  ex ports  gather  strength,  the   growth  contribution  of  net  exports  is  expected  to  be   only  slightly  negative  in  2005,  in  contrast  to  the   markedly negative growth con tribution in 2004.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Continuing  the  healthy  gr owth  from  2005,  robust   domestic  demand  should  allow  a  GDP  growth  of   around  2¼%  in  2006,  only   slightly  lower  than  in  the   previous    year.    Private    consumption    growth    is     expected  to  remain  vigo rous,  underpinned  by  the   suspension  also  in   2006  and  2007  of  the  special   pension      savings      contribu tions.      Nevertheless,       consumption growth should moderate as the effects of  the  tax  cuts  on  real  disposab le  income  taper  off.  In   addition,  the  stimulus  to   household  wealth  coming   from  the  substantial  rises  in  house  prices  in  recent   years  is  expected  to  be  less  marked  as  the  financing   costs rise.  Denmark’s  export  markets  are  expected  to  expand   firmly  in  the  forecast  period,  and  Danish  exports  are   set  to  grow  robustly,  albeit  with   some  loss  of  market   share. This is a not uncommon feature for Denmark in  phases    of    upswing,    linked     inter    alia    to    the     composition  of  exports.  As  the  growth  of  imports  is   expected to dampen in  line with domestic demand, the  growth   contribution   of   ne t   exports   should   turn    positive in the forecast period.  In    2007,    a    continued     slowdown    of    private     consumption  is  expected  as  consumer  demand  for   durables   begins   to   be   sati sfied   and   interest   rates    increase.   In   the   absence   of   further   tax   cuts,   the    stimulus  from  income  ga ins  will  be  weaker.  Exports   are   foreseen   to   remain   robust,   with   net   exports    contributing   positively   to    economic   activity.   The    upswing is thus foreseen to  be more balanced and less  dependent  on  strong  consumption  growth.  On  this   basis,  GDP  growth  in  2007  is  expected  to  be  around   2%. Labour market, costs and prices  After the only slight improvemen t in 2004, the labour  market  reacted  positively,  though  with  some  lag,  to   the   recovery   in   economic   activity.   Employment    growth  picked  up  in  2005  and  unemployment  has   started   to   head   down   firmly.   As   the   expansion    continues, the labour market can be expected to move  close  to  its  capacity  towards  the  end  of  the  forecast   period.  This  should  lead  to  some  upward  pressure  on   domestic   inflation   coming   from   wages.   However,    there are as yet few sign s of labour shortages leading  to  wage-driven  inflation.  In   particular  in  the  tradable  goods sectors, globalisation may be acting to dampen  inflationary pressures.  After the historically low inflati on in 2004, which was  due to temporary price effects due to tax cuts and low  import  prices,  consumer  price  inflation  in  2005  has   increased.  This  is  largely  due  to  rising  energy  prices,   while  domestic  inflation   remains  relatively  subdued.   Over  the  forecast  period,  the  effects  on  inflation  of   rising  oil  prices  will  taper   off,  while  domestically   generated   inflation   is   set   to   pick   up   as   capacity    pressure in the economy increases. Headline inflation  is foreseen to be around  2% through 2007.  Public finances  Denmark’s public finances are  among the strongest in  the  EU.  After  a  surplus  of   2.7%  of  GDP  in  2004,   general  government  finances  are  expected  to  post  an   even higher surplus of arou nd 3½% of GDP in 2005.  In  addition  to  the  effects  of  the  healthy  growth,  the   strength   of   public    finances   is   largely   due   to   the    developments    of    revenues    from    oil    and    gas     exploitation  and  from  the  pension  fund  yield  tax,   where   the   rise   in   prices   and   financial   market    developments  respectively  have  boosted  tax  revenues   substantially.   It   should   be   noted   that   the   figures    reported by the Commission, in  contrast to the Danish  National  Accounts,  include  the  surplus  of  the  ATP   pension    fund,    thereby    improving    the    general     government  balance  by  aro und  1  pp  of  GDP.  This   situation is expected to continu e until spring 2007.  In  the  forecast  period,  dampened  economic  activity   and  receding  oil  prices  and  lower  revenues  from  the   pension  fund  yield  tax   are  expected  to  contribute  to   lower  surpluses.  On  this  basi s,  the  gross  debt  ratio  is   expected  to  continue  to   fall  markedly,  reaching  some   31% of GDP at th e end of 2007. 		
November/2005	Germany	Domestic demand picking up only gradually 	Seasonally-adjusted GDP data ha ve been very volatile  over the last few quarters. After a marginal decline in  the last quarter of 2004, the fi rst quarter of 2005 saw a  strong  pick-up,  followed  by  stagnation  in  the  second.   However,  this  variation  in  activity  may  have  been   exaggerated  by  the  statistical  adjustment  for  calendar   effects. Overall,  the  main  growth  c ontribution  came  from   foreign  demand.  Exports  benefited  from  decreasing   relative  unit  labour  costs,  which  led   to  higher  market   shares  in  an  environment  of  growing  world  trade.  In   contrast,  domestic  demand  remained  weak  as  both   private   consumption   and   construction   investment    receded further in the first half of 2005. The reduction  in the personal income tax rate from the beginning of  2005    has    so    far    had    little    effect    on    private     consumption.  Indicators  point  to  a  stro nger  second  half  of  2005  as   the  German  economy  is  sufferi ng  less  from  rising  oil   and  other  raw  material  pri ces  than  might  have  been   expected.  Net  exports  will  rem ain  the  main  driving   force. Recent data on production and domestic orders  for investment goods point  towards a strengthening of  machinery and equipment investment whereas private  consumption    may    still     remain    sluggish.    The     construction   sector   is   proj ected   to   continue   its    structural decline, though not at th e same rate as in the  first semester.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Foreign   trade   is   expected   to    continue   supporting    economic  growth  in  the  me dium  term.  At  broadly   stable   exchange   rates,   German   companies   should    profit in domestic and export markets from improved  price  competitiveness.  The  current  account  surplus  is   therefore projected to increase to above 4% of GDP in  2007.  During  the  winter  months  of  2005/2006  in  particular,   private  consumption  will  be   constrained   by  the  surge   in  energy  prices,  but  is   expected  to  gain  momentum   towards the end of the forecast period. From 2006 on,  real disposable income shou ld benefit from the fall in  inflation and the pick-up  in regular employment. Once  a  new  government  is  instal led,  uncertainty  about  the   future  reform  strategy  and  its  implications  should   wane.   Consequently,   the   private   savings   rate   is    expected   to   decline   somewhat   over   the   forecast    period.   Investment   in   machinery    and   equipment   should    accelerate,    while    the    decline    in    construction     investment  that  has  now  lasted  for  over  a  decade   should  only  gradually  peter  out .  Housing  investment   in  particular  is  still   suffering  from  excess  capacity,   subdued disposable income growth and, notably in the  East, a declining population.   With     a     continued     sizeable     positive     growth      contribution  from  the  external  side  and  a  gradual   recovery   of   domestic   dem and,   GDP   growth   in    Germany   will   gain   momentum.   With   a   projected    growth  rate  of  about  1½   %  year-on-year   in  2007,  actual growth should finally rise above potential.  Labour market, costs and prices  Recent   developments   in   the   labour   market   were    largely  shaped  by  policy  me asures.  The  bulk  of  the   new  jobs  created  were  the  result  of  either  subsidised   self-employment,  reduced  payr oll  taxes  ("mini-jobs")   or  work  for  benefit  recipie nts  ("one-euro  jobs").  In   contrast,   employment   subject   to   social   security    contributions  fell  substantially  in  the  first  months  of   2005,  but  seems  to  ha ve  stabilised  thereafter.  As  a   consequence,     seasonally-adj usted     unemployment      continued to increase at the beginning  of this year and  stabilised only recently.  The shift towards mo re flexible forms of employment  as  a  result  of  recent  labour  market  reforms  should   come  to  an  end  over  the  forecast  period.  In  addition,   continued  strong  exports  and  a  gradual  pick-up  in   domestic  demand  will  lead  to  a  stronger  creation  of   full-time employment. This  in turn should allow wage  growth in the private sector to pick-up as of 2007. In  the   public   sector   however,   the   recent   collective    agreement broadly fixes nominal wages at the current  level   until   the   end   of    2007.   The   current   wage    constraint,     together     with     still     rising     labour      productivity,  will  lead  to  a   further  fall  in  unit  labour   costs  in  2005  and  2006,  wh ich  should  bottom  out   thereafter.   Surging  energy  prices,  tog ether  with  increases  in  the   tobacco  tax,  have  driven   headline  inflation  to  the   highest levels in four  years. Based on the assumption  of  slightly  lower  oil  prices   compared  with  the  level   reached  in  September  2005,  inflation  should,  under   current policies with no tax  rises  legislated,   converge  towards  the  core  rate,  which   is  currently  hovering   around 1%.  Public finances  In 2005, the general governme nt deficit is projected to  widen  and  will  hence  breach  the  3%-of-GDP  ceiling   for the fourth consecutive year. In cyclically adjusted  terms,  the  deficit  is  expected  to  improve  marginally   from the previous year.   The revenue share in  GDP  is  expected  to  fall  slightly   this  year,  which  is  due  to  the  implementation  of  the   last  stage  of  the  tax  relief  law  from  the  year  2000.   However,      subsidy      repa yments      by      several       Landesbanken and the intro duction of the road toll for  lorries   are   adding   to   revenues.   The   low   wage    dynamics  and  the  fall  in  the  number  of  regular  jobs   are  weighing  on  the  contribution  base  of  the  social   security system. Despite the 2004  reform of the public  health care system, public  health insurers lowered the  contribution rates only marginally  in 2005 in order to  continue running surpluses so as to reduce their debt.  Expenditure  relief  continues   to  come  from  public   sector     wage     restraint,     reductions     in     public      employment    and    a    declining    share    of    public     investment  in  GDP.  Nevert heless,  the  expenditure   share  in  GDP  is  unlikely  to   fall  in  2005.  While   pension outlays have been growing less than nominal  GDP, the rising number of recipients is burdening the  budget.  Pensions  are  inde xed  to  wage  developments   with  a  lag.  Despite  the  stagnating  contribution  base,   current  legislation  prevents  a   decline  in  expenditure   per recipient. As a consequence, the liquidity funds of  the  pension  system  have  b een  further  depleted  in   order   to   hold   the   contribution   rate   constant.   The    dampening  effect  of  the  2004  reform  of  the  health   sector   abated   in   2005   due   to   rising   prices   of    medication.  The  expenditure  relief  from  the  public  sector  wage   bill and reduced public inve stment has been balanced  by       significantly       gro wing       expenditure       on        unemployment   and   social    benefits.   Employment    growth  could  not  contribut e  much  to  reducing  this   budgetary burden, as it was to a large extent promoted  by   public   schemes.   Holde rs   of   “one-euro   jobs”    continue  to  be  entitled  to   their  social  benefits  and   receive a small top-up. Moreover, the implementation  of the new social benefit system (“Hartz IV”-package)  did not provide the expenditure relief expected by the  government.  Administrative  frictions  in  the  transition   have been greater than expected, and problems in the  application   of   means-testing   have   led   to   higher    expenditure   per   head    and   a   higher   number   of    recipients than expected.  Finally, the pension office for former post office civil  servants securitised future con tributions from the post  office’s  successor  companies,  raising  its  liquidity,  so   that the federal government w ould be able to postpone  payments  to  the  office  in  20 05,  equalling  0.25%  of   GDP.    According    to    ESA95     accounting    rules,     however, this transaction does not reduce government  expenditure calculated on an accrual basis. Up  to  the  cut-off  date  for  this  forecast,  the  federal   government  had  not  adopted  a  draft  budget  for  2006.   With  current  legislati on  in  force,  Germany  would   continue breaching the 3%-of- GDP deficit ceiling also  in  2006  and  2007.   Further  changes  to  the  tax  system   are  not  legislated.  Budgetary  relief  will  continue  to   come  from  the  public  sector   wage  bill,  as  the  wage   agreement   of   2005    extends   to   20 07.   In   addition,    pension  expenditure  is  projected  to  be  dampened  by   the  slow  growth  of  the  contribution  base.  In  2006,   companies  will  have  to  carry  forward  a  part  of  their   monthly  social  contributio ns  from  the  middle  of  the   following  month  to  the  end  of  the  month  when  the   payment  is  due.  This  will  le ad  to  thirteen  instead  of   twelve cash payments in 2005, but does not affect the  budget balance according to ESA95 accounting rules.  With   the   political   intention   to   keep   the   pension    contribution  rate  constant,  the  pension  system  will   record  a  deficit  in  2006  an d  2007.  Under  current   legislation,  the  unemploym ent  insurance  period  will   be shortened for elderly  new recipients from February  2006, providing budgetary relief from 2007. This will  be  supported  by  the  recov ery  in  the  primary  labour   market expected for 2007. Overall, these measures are  projected   to   reduce   the   cyclically-adjusted   deficit    slightly towards the end of the forecast period.   Government  debt  would  continue  to  rise  over  the   entire forecast period, reaching 70% of GDP by 2006.  According  to  ESA95  acco unting  rules,  privatisation   operations   that   involve    the   transfer   of   shares   to    Kreditanstalt  für  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  are  not  debt- reducing,  pending  the  actual   sale  of  shares  on  the   market  by  KfW.  As  the  federal  government  would   have transferred most of its stock to KfW by 2006, the  dampening  effect  of  priva tisation  proceeds  on  gross   debt will wane. 		
November/2005	Estonia	Booming activity, with external balance set to improve 	GDP  growth  accelerated  further  during  the  first  six   months  of  2005,  from  an  annual  growth  rate  of  7.8%   in  2004  to  a  remarkable  8.6%.  Activity  is  receiving   strong  support  from  both  domestic  demand  and  net   exports,  including  tourism.  I nvestment  jumped  by   9.1%, up from 6% last year, while private and public  consumption,  though  lively,  expanded  at  a  distinctly   slower  pace  than  GDP.  Construction  benefited  in   particular  from  a  housing  boom,  driving  up  credit   demand.  With the trade balance rapidly improving, the external  account deficit is likely to narrow to less than 10% of  GDP  this  year,  despite  a  widening  deficit  on  the   income balances.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Estonia’s economy is expected  to remain on a path of  strong and broad-based growth, with annual rates well  above  7%  and  little  cyclical  variation.  Investment  is   expected    to    remain    strong,    fuelled    by    public     infrastructure  spending  a nd  smooth  absorption  of  EU   transfers. The corporate sector can also be expected to  invest  vigorously,  partly  due  to   the  fact  that  a  tax   exemption  for  reinvested  earn ings  will  be  abolished   by the end of 2008, in accordance with the provisions  of   the   EU   Accession   Treaty.   Net   exports   should    remain positive, while private  and public consumption  may  ease  somewhat,  keeping  overall  growth  well- balanced.   Continued adherence to a prudent fiscal stance and the  build-up  of  private  pension  funds  should  improve   Estonia’s     savings–investment     balance.     As     a      consequence,   the   external   account   deficit   can   be    expected  to  distinctly  narrow   to  a  more  sustainable   level  of  around  6%  of  GDP  towards  the  end  of  the   forecast period.  Labour market, costs and prices  Buoyant    activity    is    creating    many    new    job     opportunities,     notably      for     the     self-employed.      However,  statistics  may  overestimate  the  effective   increase,  as  improved  tax  collection  measures  are   leading   to   a   systematic   wh itening   of   the   grey    economy.   This   same   effect   explains   part   of   the    employment    growth    observed    in    2005.    With     unemployment  steadily  decreasing  to  8.1%  of  the   workforce   in   August   20 05,   labour   shortages   are    emerging in certain segments of the market.   Although wage pressure is mounting in some sectors,  overall  wage  growth  continues  to  be  largely  in  line   with      the      substantial      pr oductivity      increases.       Consequently,  real  unit  labo ur  costs  for  the  whole   economy   are   projected   to   remain   largely   broadly    stable.   Service   sector   wages   are   growing   most    strongly   as   tourism   and   transport   services   are    booming,  followed  by  cons truction  and  the  public   sector.  Since  wage  formation  is  highly  decentralised,   settlements   largely   respect   each   sector’s   financial    constraints. During  the  first  9  months  of  2005,  HICP  inflation   picked  up  strongly  to  an  average  of  more  than  4%   year-on-year,  from  3%  in   the  year  2004.  Since  June,   when  the  strong  base  effect  from  EU  accession  in   2004   had   just   started   to   abate,   consumer   prices    accelerated  again  as  a  result  of  the  oil  price  shock   combined   with   a   number   of   administered   price    increases that became effective in March. The weight  of  energy  in  the  Estonian  HICP  basket  is  among  the   highest  in  the  EU.  Owing  to   this,  core  inflation  rates   so  far  have  remained  stable  and  low,  at  around  2%,   while overall monthly HICP rates are running twice as  high.   Higher  oil  prices  and  public  transport  charges  will   continue  to  drive  up   inflation  in  the  months  to  come.   Annual HICP inflation is projected to peak at over 4%  in 2005 before gradually declining to somewhat above  3% in 2006 and to around 2½% in 2007. With strong  competition   in   the   retail   sector,   low   pressure   on    producer   prices   and   even   declining   prices   in   the    telecom  industry,  core  in flation  can  be  expected  to   remain at present levels, provided that wage increases  stay in line with productivity  gains. Since the country  is  aiming  for  adoption  of  the   euro  in  2007,  keeping   inflation  in  check  will  remain  high  on  the  Estonian   policy agenda.   Public finances  Despite  a  supplementary  budget  adopted  in  October   2005 raising expenditure by 1.3% of GDP, Estonia is  expected   to   post   a   higher-than-projected   general    government surplus of over  1% of GDP in 2005. This  is  owed  to  a  combination   of  efficient  tax  collection,   buoyant GDP growth and windfall gains from higher- than-anticipated inflation , in combination with strictly  applied nominal expenditure ceilings.  The  comfortable  budgetary  situ ation  is  set  to  prevail   throughout  2006  and  2007.  The  2006  budget  which   targets a small surplus is at  present before Parliament,  to be adopted in the last days of the year. The official  target for 2007 is a balanced budget. However, as has  been   the   case   in   recent   years,   some   room   for    manoeuvre  seems  to  be  bu ilt  into  the  underlying   government  forecast.  For  both  years,  further  cuts  to   the  flat  income  tax  rate,   from  its  current  24%  to  an   eventual   22%,   are   planned   on   the   revenue   side.    Possible handouts to the elect orate ahead of the 2007  national   elections ,   especially   higher   benefits   for    pensioners,   whose   income   is    not   fully   protected    against  losses  in  purchasing  power,  may  partly  be   covered   by   accumulated   public   reserves.   In   all,    budgetary  executio n  may  yield  small  surpluses  also   for 2006 and 2007. Still,  the  fiscal  stance  is  expected   to  ease  at  a  time  when  GDP  growth  is  close  to  its   estimated potential. 		
November/2005	Greece	Growth returns to potential 	Following two years of strong economic activity, with  GDP  growing  at  4.7%,  high  growth  continued  in  the   first  quarter  of  2005.   However,  the  second  quarter   brought   eviden ce   of   a   slowdown,   which   would    suggest  that  the  planned  fiscal  withdrawal  and  the   petering  out  of  the  ‘Olymp ic  bonus’  would  already   weigh  on  growth  prospects.  Leading  indicators  and   hard  data  also  point  to   slowing-down  activity  for  the   second  half  of  the  year,  as  well  as  for  the  year  as  a   whole, but by less than  anticipated in the Commission  services   spring   2005   forecasts,   which   projected    growth  rates  around  3%.  In   addition,  no  clear  signs   have yet been observed that the recent oil price hike is  having  a  significant  impact  on  the  real  economy.   Overall,  GDP  growth  for  2005  is  projected  at  3.5%.   Although    this    growth    projection    represents    a     relatively  sharp  growth  slowdo wn  compared  with  the   4.7%  GDP  growth  rate  recor ded  in  2004,  economic   activity  in  Greece  is  still  growing  well  above  most   euro-area countries.  The  slowdown  has  its  origin  in  a  deceleration  of  the   domestic sector, while, after several years of negative  contributions,  net  exports  should  add  to  growth  this   year.  With  real  disposable  income  growing  less  than   last    year,    private    consumption    is    projected    to     decelerate in 2005. In parallel, the fiscal retrenchment  should put a brake on public consumption and reduce  public investment in real  terms, thus heavily weighing  on  total  investment,  which  is  projected  to  grow  at  a   sluggish  1%  in  real  terms.  Overall,  domestic  demand   is  now  expected  to  grow  by  less  than  3%,  compared   with more than 4.5% last year.  Lower growth prospects in th e domestic sector should  partially   be   compensated   by    developments   in   the    external  sector.  The  sharp  deceleration  in  domestic   demand    is    weighing    on    imports,    which,    after     stagnating  in  the  first  half  of  the  year,  are  forecast  to   be  just  above  1%  for  th e  whole  year.  However,   supported  by  a  strong  tou rism  sector  and,  to  a  lesser   extent,  by  wage  moderation,  exports  could  grow  by   close to 6%. As a result, the external sector could add  almost one percentage point to GDP growth.  Prospects in 20 06 and 2007  Although    the    Greek    economy    is    projected    to     decelerate  only  marginally  over  the  forecast  horizon,   important     changes     are     expected     in     growth      composition.  In  particul ar,  economic  activity  will  be   almost  exclusively  based  on  domestic  demand.  GDP   is  expected  to  grow  at  just  below  3.5%  in  both  2006   and  2007,  so  that  the  Greek  economy  could  continue   growing  above  the  rates  projected  in  spring  and,   indeed,  well  above  those  of  the  euro  area.  Moderate   wage  and  employment  growth,  as  well  as  higher  oil   prices,  should  cause  private  consu mption  to  slightly   decelerate.   However,   investment   is   projected   to    rebound  and  sustain  domestic  demand.  This  rebound   is expected to come from pu blic investment, which is  projected  to  return  to  growth  rates  close  to  those  of   GDP.  Overall,  as  the  recent  incentives  law  and  the   business tax reform should  continue to support private  investment,   total   gross   fixed   capital   formation   is    projected to grow at  above 4% in 2006.   On  the  external  front,  imports  are  also  projected  to   rebound  next  year,  coming  back   to  rates  more  in  line   with past trends and growing by more than 4%. Based  on  a  resilient  tourism  sector   and  helped  by  wage   moderation,  exports  are  expected  to  grow  above  6%.   As   a   result,   the   external   sector   is   projected   to    contribute marginally to GDP growth.  The   economy   should   develop   along   quite   similar    trends towards the end of the forecast period, with the  external sector being broadly neutral for growth.  Labour market, costs and prices  Consistent  with  decelerating  but  still  robust  GDP   growth,     employment     (full-time     equivalent)     is      projected to grow above 1%  per year until 2007. The  unemployment  rate  should  accordingly  decrease  to  around 10% by the end of the forecast period. Wages  per  head  are  set  to  keep  rising  above  the  projected   productivity  growth,  but  by   much  less  than   in  2004.   The   combination   of   high   nominal   wage   growth,    strong  domestic  demand  and  oil  price  hikes  should   fuel  inflation,  which  is  expected   to  rise  to  3.5%  this   year and remain close to 3% until 2007.  Public finances  The  September  2005  notification  reported  a  deficit   figure  of  6.6%  of  GDP  in  2004 1 .  Compared  with  the   deficit  reported  in  March  this  year,  the  2004  deficit   outcome  is  0.5  percentage  poin ts  of  GDP  higher.  For   2005,  a  deficit  of  3.7%  is   projected,  in  line  with  the   planned   deficit   announced   by    the   government   in    September.  This  projection  includes  0.8  percentage   points  of  GDP  one-off  revenues  from  a  securitisation   of  tax  arrears,  although  the  accounting  treatment  of   this operation has not been yet approved by Eurostat.  The  deficit  for  2006  is  projected  at  3.8%  of  GDP,   which  compares  with  the  target  of  2.6%  in  the  draft   budget.  Several  factors  explain  this  difference.  The   forecast is based on a less favourable growth scenario  (3.4%  compared  with  3.8%  in  the  draft  budget)  and   on  a  more  prudent  assessment  of  direct  tax  revenues,   based    on    past    outcomes.    Moreover,    temporary     revenues worth 0.6% of GDP have not been taken into  account  because  the  draft  budget  does  not  spell  out   the    underlying    measures.    Following    established     practice,  the  deficit  projection   for  2007,  around  3.8%   of  GDP,  is  based  on  unchanged  legislation.  Finally,   after  rising  to  more  than   109%  of  GDP  in  2004,  the   general  government  debt  is  projected  to  still  remain   above 100% of GDP at the end of the forecast period. 		
November/2005	Spain	Sustained growth but higher external imbalances 	Economic activity in 2005  is underpinned by dynamic  domestic     demand,     while     the     external     sector      continuous  contributing  ne gatively  to  growth.  Private   consumption  remains  robust,   supported  by  strong  job   creation  and  easy  monetary  an d  financial  conditions.   Such  factors  are  also  largely  behind  the  projected   acceleration  in  household  investment  in  dwellings.   Private  consumption  growing  above  real  disposable   income  should  further  lower  the  households’  savings   rate,  which  is  expected  to   fall  below  10%.  This  will   further  increase  households’  exposure  to  interest  rate   and  employment  shocks.  Inve stment  in  equipment  is   projected   to   remain   robust,   reflecting   improved    business   expectations.   Overall,   domestic   demand    would  contribute  with  more  than  5  percentage  points   to GDP grow th in 2005.  The external sector is still reco rding large imbalances.  Its negative contribution to  growth could be close to 2  percentage  points  this  year.  In   spite  of  increasing  oil   prices,  imports  are  projected  to  grow  at  7%  in  real   terms,  while  exports  present  a  rather  flat  profile,   growing at a meagre 1%. As a result, the trade deficit  should  widen  by  more  than  1  percentage  point  of   GDP  to  attain  7½%  this  year,  while  the  net  lending   position  of  the  country  would  reach  6.3%  of  GDP   (4.4%  in  2004).  These  wide ning  external  imbalances   mirror the continuous deteriorati on of the competitive  position of the Spanish economy.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  GDP  growth  is  projected  to   slightly  decelerate  to   3.2%   in   2006.   Growth   should   still   be   based   on    buoyant   domestic   demand,   as,   in   spite   of   higher    interest rate expectations, high  inflation is projected to  keep  real  interest  rates  in   the  red,  which,  in  turn,   should   push   private   consumption   growing   above    disposable income. As a  result, the saving ratio should  continue in a decreasing path,  going just below 8%. In  parallel,  household  debt  would  rise  well  above  100%   of   gross   disposable   income.   Investments   should    remain  robust,  backed  by   equipment  and  software,   whereas residential construction growth is expected to  moderate.  All  in  all,  the  contribution  of  domestic   demand  to  GDP  growth  is  projected  to  be  slightly   below 5 percentage points.  Imports  are  projected  to   decelerate  only  marginally   since   the   modest   slowdown   in   domestic   demand    comes  from  the  construction  sector,  which  has  a  low   import intensity. Deteriorating  competitiveness should  keep  exports  growing  well  below  EU  trade,  thus   further       reducing       Spanish       market       shares.        Consequently,  the  trade  deficit   should  continue  to   widen  to  over  8.5%  of  GDP.  Overall,  the  negative   contribution  from  the  external  sector  to  GDP  growth   is projected to be above 1.5 percentage points.  GDP  growth  is  projected  to  further  slow  down  in   2007.  Although  o il  prices  are  expected  to  remain   relatively   stable,   higher   interest   rate   expectations    should  finally  lead  to  po sitive  interest  rates  in  real   terms,  which  would  put  a  break  on  both  private   consumption   and   investment   in   dwellings.   With    residential  construction  grow ing  at  a  reduced  speed,   gross  fixed  capital  formation  should  decelerate  at  the   end  of  the  forecast  period.  In  parallel,  although  at  a  more moderate path, the household saving rate should  go   down   to   situate   just    below   8%   of   the   gross    disposable   income,   which,    in   turn,   will   further    increase  household’s  debt.  Overall,  in  spite  of  the   rising  risks  associated  to  th e  financial  position  of   households,  domestic  demand  would  contribute  to   GDP growth by around 4¼ percentage points.  The   projected   deceleration   of   domestic   demand    should  further  moderate  im port  growth.  However,   since  no  significant  improvements  are  expected  on   productivity    growth    and    inflation    differentials     between  Spain  and  its  main  trade  partners,  exports   would only grow by 2%, t hus leading to further losses  of  market  shares.  As  a  result,  the  trade  deficit  might   peak   above   9%   of   GDP.   Overall,   the   negative    contribution  to  GDP  growth   from  the  external  sector   should remain slightly  below 1¼ percentage points.  The  evolution  of  the  external  accounts  in  2006  and   2007 deserves special atten tion. Declining net tourism  inflows  will  narrow  the  surplus  recorded  by  services,   especially  tourism,  which  ha s  traditionally  offset  the   deficit  in  goods  trade.  The  deficit  of  the  balance  of   primary    incomes    and    current    transfers    should     increase,   partially   as   a   result   of   larger   migrants’    transfers  abroad  and  the  expected  decrease  in  EU   transfers by 2007. In fact, prov isional data for the first  half of 2005 indicate that the surplus of services only  just  compensates  for  the  aggregate  deficits  in  the   primary   incomes   and   current   transfers   accounts.    Therefore,  the  cu rrent  account  deficit  is  of  same  size   as  the  trade  deficit.  All  in  all,  the  current  account   deficit  is  expected  to  reach  9%  of  GDP  at  the  end  of   the forecast period. The net borrowing position of the  economy  is  projected  at  ab ove  8%  of  GDP  in  2007.   Since   net   FDI   is   projected   to   decrease,   portfolio    investments   should   repr esent   the   main   source   of    finance  of  the  external  deficit.  Persistently  increasing   financial  needs  might  put   pressure  on  risk  premia,   with    possible    negative    feedbacks    for    Spanish     households,   which   are   already    highly   exposed   to    interest rate shocks.  There are risks to this scenario. In particular, some of  the   current   trends,      nam ely,   higher   household’s    indebtedness,  low  productiv ity  growth,  a  persistent   inflation  differential  with  the  euro  area  and  wider   external  imbalances,  are  increasing  the  risks  of  a   slowdown  of  the  internal  demand.  However,  neither   hard  data  nor  softer  indicators  currently  point  to  a   likely drastic deceleration of the economic activity in  the short term.   Labour market, costs and prices   Job  creation  is  projected  to  remain  robust  over  the   forecast  period.  In  2005,  employment  is  expected  to   grow at around 3% in full-time-equivalent terms. Part  of  the  growth  is  the  result  of  the  regularization  of   immigrants  carried  out  by  the  government  during  the   first  semester  of  the  year.  In  2006  and  2007,  job   creation  should  decelerate  to  about  2.5%  and  2.2%   respectively,  in  line  with   slower  economic  activity,   especially      in      residential      construction.      The       unemployment   rate   would   slightly   fall   over   the    forecast  period,  to  around  8%  of  the  labour  force  by   2007.  Following  the  oil  price  hi ke  in  the  first  and  second   quarters  of  2005,  headline  in flation,  measured  by  the   HICP,  might  be  close  to  3½%  at  the  end  of  the  year,   while    core    inflation    would    remain    around    1     percentage  point  lower.  Since  the  increase  in  energy   prices  is  expected  to  have  also   an  impact  on  2006,   inflation is projected to rema in above 3% in that year  and  then  ease  gradually  to  2.4%  in  2007.  Structural   factors  such  as  insufficien t  competition  in  certain   utilities  and  services  sectors,  coup led  with  remaining   rigidities   in   the   labour   mark et,   would   keep   the    inflation  differential  with  the  euro  area  at  around  1   percentage point. Although  the relative moderation of  construction prices in 2006 a nd 2007 should lead to a  narrowing of the gap, the  GDP deflator is projected to  keep  growing  well  above  the  HICP  over  the  forecast   period.  Compensation  of  employees  per  head  is  projected  to   grow  at  around  3%  until  the  end  of  the  forecast   period.  Therefore,  real  wage s  would  almost  stagnate,   consistently  with  low  pro ductivity  growth.  However,   nominal  wages  in  Spain   would  still  grow   above  the   euro   area   average,   thus   mirroring   the   high   and    persistent   inflation   differential.   Low   productivity    growth,  coupled  with   high  inflation,  will  continue   being  a  drag  on  the  co mpetitiveness  of  the  Spanish   economy.  As  a  result,  unit  labour  costs  are  projected   to keep on growing above the euro area average.   Public finances  According to the  EDP notification of September 2005,  a  small  surplus  of  0.1%  of  GDP  is  projected  for  the  general  government  consolidated  balance  in  2005.   This  target  appears  attainable.  In  2006,  a  close-to- balance  position  is  projected   in  both  nominal  and   structural  terms.  Therefore,  the  fiscal  policy  should   remain  broadly  neutral 2 .  This  is  in  line  with  the  draft   Budget  Law,  which  target s  a  general  government   surplus  of  0.2%,  based  on  a   plausible  scenario  where   nominal  GDP  is  projected  to   grow  by  7%.  However,   the official projected revenues growth by 8.4% for the  central  government  could  turn   out  slightly  optimistic.   Regarding  central  governmen t  expenditures,  the  draft   budget   gives   priority   to   R&D   and   infrastructures    expenditure,  which  will  gr ow  by  around  30%  and   12%    respectively.    Overall,    central    government     expenditures  are  projected  to  increase  by  around  8%   in  nominal  terms.  In  20 07,  within  the  framework  of   the    customary    no-policy    change    scenario,    with     decelerating    residential    construction    and    private     consumption,   the   elasticity   of   indirect   taxes   is    projected  to  partially  return  to  its  long-term  value  of   about 1. Consequently, revenues would grow at 6½%  in  nominal  terms,  compared  with  6%  nominal  GDP   growth.  However,  total  expenditures  are  assumed  to   follow previous trends and increase by 7½%. On this  basis, the general government deficit could be around  0.4% of a percentage point of GDP. The debt to GDP  ratio  is  projected  to  continue   on  a  declining  path,   falling  from  almost  47%  of  GDP  in  2004  to  41%  in   2007. 		
November/2005	France	More balanced growth 	In  2005,  real  GDP  growth  slowed  down  more  than   expected.  In  the  second  quarter  of  this  year,  French   GDP  grew  by  a  mere  0.1%  (q-o-q),  after  having   increased by 0.4% in the first quarter and 0.6% in the  fourth   quarter   of   2004.   Domestic   demand   and    especially  private  consumption,  which  had  supported   the  French  economy  in  previous  quarters,  declined.   The   expiry   of   tax   exemption,   which   previously    encouraged   households   to   free   up   some   savings,    might  partly  explain  the  fall  in  consumption  in  the   second  quarter.    Lower  sal es  prospects  and  concerns   related    to    oil    price    volatility    hampered    firms’     investment   plans.   According   to   national   accounts    data, business investment fell  by 1.2% (q-o-q), after a  rise of 1.9% in the preceding quarter. On the external  side,  the  contribution  of  net  trade  to  GDP  growth   continued  to  be  negativ e.  All  in  all,  the  increase  in   stocks  was  the  only  factor  that  prevented  the  French   economy from declining in the second quarter.   Recent indicators suggest that GDP growth is likely to  strengthen  in  the  third  quar ter  of  2005,  supported  by   an  exceptional  rebound  in  consumer  spending  on   manufactured  goods.  However,  private  consumption   is  not  likely  to  grow  on  a  sustained  basis  since  the   recovery of employment is  slower than expected.   Exports  are  projected  to  recover  in  the  next  semester   thanks  to  the  depreciation  of   the  euro.  All  in  all,  the   economy is forecast to grow by about ½% and ¼% q- o-q,  respectively,  in  the  third  and  fourth  quarter  of   2005.    Prospects for 2006 and 2007  In 2006, real GDP growth is expected to strengthen to  1¾% and to be slightly ab ove its potential in 2007 at  2¼%.  Economic  activity   should  still  be  driven  by   domestic  demand,  but  the  co ntribution  of  net  exports   to GDP growth should be less  negative by the end of  the forecast period.  Private  consumption  is  forecast  to  remain  the  main   driving   force   of   economic   growth,   based   on   an    expected  recovery  in  employment.  It  will  increase  in   line  with  disposable  househol d  income,  reflecting  the   expected rise in the demand for labour. By the end of  2007,  the  reform  of  the   35-hour  working  week  may   boost   households’   income   through   an   increase   in    authorised   annual   overtime   and   the   possibility   of    converting   the   extra   time   sav ed   into   additional    revenues.   The   projected   benign   inflation   outlook    should also support  households’ purchasing power.   Investment  in  equipment  is  expected  to  decelerate   next year (from 4¾ to 3¾%), mainly due to relatively  low  capacity  utilisation.  In  2 007,  this  tendency  is   likely to be reversed due  to a more positive economic  outlook,  still  supportiv e  financing  conditions  and  the   retention    of    lower    tax    rates    on    new    capital     expenditure.  In  contrast,  the   investment  in  building   construction  is  forecast  to  strengthen  from  2.4%  in   2005  to  about  3%  in   the  two  coming  years  thanks  to   historically favourable  mortgage financ ing conditions.   After  a  loss  in  export  market  shares  in  2005  for  the   third  consecutive  year,  export  volumes  are  projected   to  increase  again  more  in  lin e  with  the  expansion  of  external  demand.  This  is  due  to  an  improvement  in   price competitiveness linked to the depreciation of the  euro and a somewhat stronger impulse from France’s  main trading partners (not ably Germany and Italy). In  this  context,  and  although  imports  are  forecast  to   remain  buoyant  in  response  to  the  robustness  of  final   demand, the negative contribu tion of net trade to GDP  growth will diminish over the forecast horizon.   Labour markets, costs and prices  Uncertainties    concerning    th e    durability    of    the     recovery    and    the    traditiona l    lag    with    which         employment   reacts   to   economic   activity   largely    explain  the  current  weakness   in  employment  growth.   In  2006  and  2007,  employme nt  growth  is  set  to   strengthen    in    response    to     improved    corporate     profitability  and  better  economic  prospects  over  the   forecast horizon. The recovery of employment should  also   be   stimulated   by   th e   implementation   of   the    “emergency    employment    plan”    which    aims    at     facilitating   recruitment   by   small   companies   and    encouraging   return   to   work .   This   would   allow   a    substantial  decline  in  the   unemployment  rate,  from   9.7% of the labour force in 2004 to 8.9% in 2007.  Given   the   still   high    unemployment   rate,   wage    moderation  is  expected  to  continue  over  the  forecast   horizon.  Nevertheless,  wages  will   still  be  supported   by  the  harmonisation  of  the   different  levels  of  the   minimum   wage,   induced   by   the   reduction   in   the    working week to 35 hour s implemented between 1998  and  2002,  as  well  as  by  the  increase  in  authorised   annual  overtime  and  the   possibility  of  converting  a   part  of  it  into  additional   income.  Moreover,  a  slight   cyclical  acceleration  in  wages  is  expected  to  occur  in   2006  and  2007,  driven  by  the  improvement  of  the   situation in the labour market.  As productivity growth is expected to decelerate from  the  high  rate  observed  in   2004,  unit  labour  costs   should  rise  in  2005  but   remain  broadly   constant  over   the  forecast  horizon.  Core  inflation  is  thus  projected   to pick up gradually, due to some diffusion effects of  oil  prices  and  price  increases  in  the  services  sector.   The    government’s    amendment    of    the    so-called     Galland   Law   regulating   the   relationship   between    French retailers and their suppliers  is likely to lead to  lower prices of major branded products and hence to a  moderation  of  headline  infl ation.  On  the  other  hand,   expected   increases   in   administered   prices   notably    linked  to  the  health-care  reform  and  administered   energy  prices  should  contribute  to  a  rise  in  HICP   inflation.  Overall  HICP  inflation  sh ould  be  slightly   above 2% in 2006 and  slightly below 2% in 2007.  Public finances  Following  a  decline  from  4.2%  to  3.6%  of  GDP  in   2004,  the  general  government  deficit  is  projected  to   be   further   reduced   to   3.2%   of   GDP   in   2005,    somewhat higher than the  government deficit estimate  at  3%  of  GDP.  The  Commission’s  scenario  is  based   on   (i)   a   weaker   macroeconomic   scenario   with   a    slower  growth  in  comp ensation  of  employees  and   private  consumption  and  hence  lower  wage-based   contributions  and  VAT,  and  (ii)  higher  expenditures   notably  in  local  administrations  and  social  security   funds (due to lower employ ment and higher prices).  This     forecast     incorporates     substantial     one-off      payments   to   the   general   g overnment   for   a   total    amount  of  0.5%  of  GDP  which  are  linked  to  the   inclusion    of    the    specific    electricity    and    gas     companies’  pension  schemes  in  the  general  regime.   New  tax  measures  have  a  positive  impact  on  the   deficit  of  about  0.2%  of  GDP  and  notably  include  (i)   an  increase  in  social  security  contributions  resulting   from  the  above-mentioned   incorporation  of   specific   pension    schemes    into    the    general    one,    the     implementation  of  the  health-care  reform  and  the   creation of a complementary  pension regime for civil  servants,    and    (ii)    an    exceptional    tax    of    25%     (compensating  for  the  suppression  of  the  previous   system) on distributed prof its not taxed at the normal  rate 1 .  Dynamic  revenues  notably  from  the  personal   income  tax  and  revenues  stemming  from  a  good   housing  and  stock  exchange  performance  (such  as   taxes   on   change   of   ownership   and   on   interest    earnings)   should   lead   to   an   overall   elasticity   of    revenues  to  GDP  of  about   1.2,  above  the   long-term  average.  This  forecast  for  2005  is  consistent  with  an   improvement  in  the  cyclically  adjusted  balance  of   about  ½%  of  GDP,  the  largest  part  of  which  reflects   the impact of the one-off measures.   In the following years, the general government deficit  would  increase  again  to  about  3½%  of  GDP  if  no   additional  measures  are  taken .  For  2006,  this  mainly   reflects  the  fact  that  the  ½%  of  GDP  of  one-off   payments mentioned above will vanish. However, the  2006  budget  bill  also  cont ains  one-off  revenues  of   about ¼% of GDP. They are linked to the integration  of  the  postal  company’s  specific  pension  scheme  in  the  general  regime,  the  liquidation  of  a  precautionary   fund  associated  with  subsidised  mortgages 2   and  the   exceptional     collection     of     accumulated     social      contributions  on  specific  subsidised  saving  plans  that   will  thereafter  be  collected  on  an  annual  basis.  The   current  general  government   deficit  estimate  is  above   that  projected  by  the  go vernment  (at  2.9%).  The   difference   stems   from   a   base   effect,   the   growth    differential,  a  lower  tax-revenues-to-GDP  elasticity   and  somewhat  higher  expenditures  compared  to  the   government     forecast     in     the     areas     of     local      administration  and  health  expenditures.  About  the   latter,   this   forecast   acknowledges   that   the   health    reform  has  noticeably  curbed  expenditures  and  thus   lowered   its   assumption   from   4%   in   the   spring    forecast, to 3.2%, which is still somewhat higher than  that  of  the  government  (at  2.7%)  based  on  a  prudent   assessment of some of the  measures announced in the  2006   draft   budget   for   social   security   funds.   The    deficit  forecast  for  2007,  at  3½%  of  GDP,  assuming   GDP   growth   at   2.3%,   follows    the   conventional    assumption   of   unchanged   po licies.   It   thus   takes    account  of  already  decided  measures  impacting  2007   such  as  (i)  the  income  tax  reform,  (ii)  an  increase  in   the   employment   premium   and   in   the   income   tax    allowance  linked  for  young   children,  and  (iii)  the   entrenchment  of  lower  tax  rates  for  new  investment.   All in all, these measures  will represent about ¼% of  GDP in 2007. The debt to GD P  ratio  would  continue   to increase from about 65% in  2004 to 68% in 2007. 		
November/2005	Ireland	Growth to continue, fuelled by domestic demand 	According to preliminary national accounts, real GDP  expanded  by  4.1%  on  the  year  in  the  second  quarter   after a rather meagre increase of 2.1% in the previous  three  months.  In  the  first  half  of  2005,  domestic   demand  was  strong  and  appeared  to  be  the  main   driver  of  economic  growth  while  the  contribution   from  the  external  economy  was  negative.  On  the   domestic  side,  consumer  demand  slightly  picked  up   after  a  more  muted  performance  in  2004.  Investment   expenditure  also  grew  rapidly,  mirroring  very  strong   demand for equipment and  continued buoyancy of the  construction  sector.  On  the  external   side,  figures  for   the  first  half  suggest  a  fairly  weak  performance  by   exports,     reflecting     a     less     favourable     trading      environment.  Imports  put  in   a  somewhat  stronger   performance,  following  the   pick-up  in  consumer  and   investment  demand.  For  the   third  quarter,  purchasing   managers’ indices reported increased activity for both  manufacturing  and  services.  Confidence  indicators,   however,  did  not  fully  confirm  the  brightening  of  the   outlook   across   sectors,   as   there   have   been   some    fluctuations in co nsumer and retail trade sentiment.   Despite  some  risk  related   to  uncertainties  stemming   from   the   external   environment,   prospects   for   the    second  half  of  2005  are   positive.  The  economy’s   momentum is supported by recent strong employment  gains (mainly concentrated in the construction sector),  boosted    by    record    immigration    and    increased     participation.    Some    easing     of    competitiveness     pressures on the back of the recent depreciation of the  euro  might  also  allow  for   a  stronger  performance  of   exporting sectors. For  the year as a whole, real GDP is  estimated to grow ju st below 4½%, as in 2004.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  GDP growth is forecast at 4.8% and 5.0% in 2006 and  2007 respectively, close to  the rate commonly thought  to   be   sustainable   in   the   medium   term.   Robust    domestic  demand  is  expected  to  continue  to  be  the   main   driving   force   of   economic   growth.   Private    consumption  is  underpinned   by  strong  employment   growth  (albeit  lower  than   in  2005),  though  recent   fluctuations  in  confidence  suggest  that  the  projected   pick-up  in  consumer  spendi ng  into  2006  might  be   rather   gradual.   Private   spending   is   projected   to    accelerate  further  and  to  reduce  the  saving  rate  in   2007,  in  the  year  when  the  bulk  of  SSIA  funds  (a   government-sponsored      saving      scheme)      reach       maturity.  Investment  in  housi ng  is  projected  to  taper- off  over  the  forecast  period,  as  the  recent  record   volumes  of  completions  are  unlikely  to  be  repeated.   However,  part  of  the  downward  correction  in  the   residential sector is expected to  be offset by a rebound  in  commercial  construction  and  strong  infrastructure   investment. On the external side, services exports are  projected  to  put  in  a  strong  performance  but  the   outlook  for  merchandise   exports  is  somewhat  less   positive.  Import  growth  is  forecast  to  accelerate  into   2007,  in  line  with  the  projected  pick-up  in  consumer   expenditure.  As  net  profit  outflows  are  expected  to   remain on an upward trend,  the implied growth rate of  Gross National Income is somewhat lower than that of  GDP. Overall, robust economic growth is projected to  continue,   but   development s   in   the   international    economy  and  euro/dollar  exchange  rate  remain  the   key  medium-term  risks  to   an  economy  as  highly   globalised as Ireland.  Labour market, costs and prices  In 2005, employment growth is  set to strengthen to an  extremely  robust  3.8%.  In  line  with  the  projected   gradual easing back of const ruction output and strong  performance  of  the  service  s ector,  employment  gains   will be somewhat weaker but still  very robust in 2006  and 2007. Labour force growth, fuelled by significant  inward migration (notably from the new EU Member  States)  and  increased  participation,  is  projected  to   keep  up  with  the  upward  employment  trend.  The   unemployment rate is thus estimated to remain below  4½% over the forecast period. In line with the data for  the  first  half  of  2005,   per  capita  compensation  is  estimated  to  grow  at  around   5%  on  the  year  in  2005.   Some  further  easing  of  wage  inflation  is  projected  in   2006  due  to  the   completion  of  the  current  round  of   “benchmarking”  awards  to  public  sector  workers,  but   this  is  expected  to  be  partly  offset  by  relatively  tight   labour  demand.  HICP  inflation  has  somewhat  picked   up  in  the  third  quarter  of  2005,  partly  reflecting   adverse energy price developments, and is forecast to  reach 2.2% for the year as a whole. This annual rate is  expected  to  moderate  in  the  second  half  of  2006  due   to a base effect, before rising sli ghtly again into 2007  in   line   with   the   projected   revival   of   consumer    spending.  Public finances   In  2005,  the  general  government  deficit  is  estimated   to  fall  below  ½%  of  GDP,   which  compares  to  the   initial official target of 0.8% of GDP. The underlying  general  government  balance   is  even  stronger  as  the   projected  deficit  includes  higher  net  expenditure  of   around  0.6  percentage  points  of  GDP  for  a  February   2005  court  ruling  on  nursing  home  payments.  This   relatively  favourable  estimate d  outturn  is  mainly  due   to  higher-than-expected  tax  receipts,  including  also   one-off        income        from        special        Revenue         Commissioners’   (Ireland’s   tax   collection   agency)    investigations  in  2005,  a nd  partly  also  on  account  of   expected slight under-spend ing in capital outlays. The  deficit is projected to fall slightly to 0.3% and 0.1% of  GDP  in  2006  and  2007  resp ectively.  Given  the  non- indexed  nature  of  the  tax  and  social  benefit  system,   the  no-policy-change  assum ption  is  made  operational   for  2006  and  2007  by  freezing  average  tax  rates  and   adjusting  social  transfer  payments  by  the  forecast  of   CPI inflation (with a small  top-up). Government gross  debt  is  projected  on  a  mode st  downward  trend  just   below 30% of GDP over the forecast period. 		
November/2005	Italy	Signs of a moderate recovery 	After   two   consecutive   qua rters   of   negative   GDP    growth at the end of 2004 and the beginning of 2005,  the  Italian  economy  rebounded  in  the  second  quarter   of  2005.  Robust  private   consumption  and  investment   in construction, as well as stro ng exports, drove GDP  up  by  0.7%.  Recent  economic  indicators  point  to   positive   growth   in   the    second   half   of   the   year.    However, due to the decline in  output in the first three  months of the year, GDP growth in 2005 as a whole is  forecast to be only 0.2%, down from 1.2% in 2004.   The nearly flat grow th in 2005 is the result of a weak  contribution   of   domestic   demand   and   a   negative    contribution     of     the     external     sector.     Private      consumption    in    2005    has    been    supported    by     surprisingly  solid  employment  growth.  The  negative   impact  of  higher  energy   prices  on  consumption  has   been partly offset by declines in other components of  HICP inflation. Total investment is forecast to decline  by  around  1%  in  2005,  as  a   result  of  a  steep  drop  in   investment in equipment that  has been partly offset by  positive growth in constructi ons. On the external side,  in  spite  of  the  projected  recovery  in  exports  in  the   second  half  of  the  year,  Italy  is  expected  to  record  a   large   loss   of   market   shares   in   2005,   caused   by    worsening cost and  price competitiveness.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007   Against the background of the assumed strong global  growth,   broadly   stable   exc hange   rates,   favourable    financial  conditions  an d  stabilising  oil  prices,  the   recovery  started  in  the  second  quarter  of  2005  is   expected  to  consolidate  in  2006.  GDP  is  forecast  to   grow  by  around  1.5%  in  2006,  slightly  above  the   estimated rate of potential growth.    Although  the  main  con tribution  to  GDP  growth  in   2006 is expected to come from domestic demand, the  forecast  also  projects  an  improvement  in  the  external   contribution  to  growth  relative  to  2005.  In  particular,   exports  are  expected  to  accelerate,  although  to  a  rate   of   growth   still   well   below   that   of   Italy’s   export    markets.   Private  consumption  is  expected  to  be  supported  by   healthy   real   disposable   income   growth   (1.5%),    resulting  from  further  in creases  in  employment  and   real  wages.  Wealth  gains  on  households’  holdings  of   real  and  financial  assets  and  a  further  expansion  of   borrowing   could   also   pr ovide   some   stimulus   to    consumption. The household savings rate is projected  to stabilise at the 2005 level.   Better  demand  prospects  are  expected,  in  turn,  to   stimulate  investment  expenditure.  Some  of  the  pre- conditions  for  a  pick-up  in   investment  are  in  place:   business  confidence  and  orders  are  rising;  corporate   balance  sheets  have  improved  and  financing  costs   have decreased, as a result of the low level of interest  rates and the rise in share  prices. Companies will also  benefit from a reduction in  employers’ social security  contributions  of  up  to   1%  introduced  by  the  2006   budget.  However,   capacity  utilisation  is  still  close  to   its medium-term average.  The  forecast  for  2007  posits  a  continuation  of  these   trends.   GDP   growth   is   exp ected   to   slow   down   marginally,  to  1.4%,  as  the   contribution  to  growth   from   the   external    sector   returns   slightly   negative    amidst the assumed weakening in foreign demand and  further   losses   in   price   com petitiveness.   Domestic    demand  is  expected  to  continue  growing  by  around   1.5%, with a slowing down  in investment expenditure  compensated    by    slightly     stronger    consumption     growth.   Labour market, costs and prices  Reflecting  the  pick  up  in   output  and  further  effects   from the implementation of the labour market reforms  introduced     since     the     mid-1990s,     employment,      measured   in   full-time   equivalents,   is   forecast   to    expand  by  0.6%  in  both  2006  and  2007.  The  main   contribution to overall employm ent growth is likely to  continue to come from the services sector. The rate of  unemployment is expected to  fall to 7.5% in 2007.  After   declining   in   2005,    labour   productivity   is    forecast  to  pick  up  in  2006  and  2007.  Together  with   slightly lower wage inflation  in the private sector and  the  reduction  in   social  security  contr ibutions,  this   should  bring  about  a  marked  deceleration  in  unit   labour  costs  compared  to  2 005  and  contribute  to   keeping core inflation below 2%. Due to the impact of  higher  oil  prices,  headline  HICP  inflation  is  forecast   to remain slightly above 2% in 2006, before declining  to 1.9% in 2007.   The  expected  higher  rate  of   productivity  growth  and   deceleration  in  unit  labour  costs  will  temper  but  not   halt  the  loss  of  internation al  competitiveness.  Since   1999,  Italy’s  unit  wage  costs  in  manufacturing  have   risen  by  almost  20%  more  than  in  its  euro  area   partners. In addition, high non-wage costs also weigh  on Italy’s competitive position.   Public finances  Statistical  revisions  carried-out  in  May  increased  the   general  government  deficit  in  the  order  of  0.2%  of   GDP for all the years from 2001 to  2004, on  average.  The  deficit  is  now  reported   at  3.2%  of  GDP  in  2001,   2003  and  2004,  and  at  2.7%  of  GDP  in  2002.  Debt   levels  were  also  revised  upwards.  In  particular,  the   debt ratio for 2004 is now reported at 106.5% of GDP,  up from the 105.8% of GDP notified in March.  The general government deficit is forecast to increase  to  4.3  %  of  GDP  in  2005  from  3.2%  in  2004,  in  line   with the government esti mates. The primary surplus is  forecast to fall to 0.6% of GDP in 2005, from 1.8% in  2004. In cyclically-adju sted terms, the budget balance  is   expected   to   deteriorate   by   about   half   of   a    percentage  point  of  GDP  compared  to  2004.  Taking   into  account  the  decline   in  the  contribution  from   temporary  measures  from  1.4%  of  GDP  in  2004  to   0.5%  of  GDP  in  2005,  the  structural  deficit  (defined   as  the  cyclically-adjusted  deficit  net  of  one-off  and   temporary   measures)   would   be   around   half   of   a    percentage point of GDP  lower than in 2004.   In the draft budget for 2 006, the governme nt targets a  reduction  in  the  deficit  to   3.8%  of  GDP,  in  line  with   the  Council  recommendation  to  Italy  under  Article   104(7)  of  July  2005.  When  including  the  amendment   decided  by  the  government   on  28  October,  the  draft   budget  and  an  accompanying  law  decree  combine   deficit-reducing  measures  estimated  at  1.8%  of  GDP   with  new  expenditures  and  tax   cuts  totalling  0.7%  of   GDP.   The  assessment  of  the  2006  draft  budget  has  been   made  difficult  by  the  stepwi se  presentation  of  the   adjustment   measures.   On   the   basis   of   a   cautious    evaluation of some of the measures in the budget, the  Commission services forecast the 2006 deficit at 4.2%  of  GDP.  In  particular,  the  savings  on  health  care   expenditure and on current expenditure of central and  local  government  are  projected  to  fall  short  of  the   ambitious  official  targets.  Ceilings  on  health  care   expenditure have not been  attained in the past and the  new   procedures   set   in   place   to   control   health    expenditure   in   2006   will   have   to   prove   their    effectiveness.   Similarly,   the   pl anned   cuts   to   the    intermediate    consumption    of     central    and    local     governments   would   imply   decreases   in   nominal    terms,  which  do  not  seem  achievable  given  recent   expenditure  trends  and  the  fact  that  mechanisms  to   durably  contain  intermedi ate  consumption  may  need   further  strengthening.  The  primary  surplus  is  forecast   to  remain  at  the  2005   level  (0.6%  of  GDP).  Net  of   cyclical  factors,  the  budget  and  the  primary  balances   will  remain  broadly  stable  relative  to  2005.  Deficit- reducing    temporar y    and    one-off    measures,    in     particular   sales   of   real   estate   and   revenues   from    revaluations  of  corporations’  assets,  are  estimated  at   around 0.4% of GDP.  The  assessment  of  the  2006  draft  budget  carries  both   positive  and  negative  risks.   On  the  one  hand,  if   mechanisms  to  enforce  the  ceilings  on  health  care  expenditure  and  the  ambitious  cuts  on  central  and   local government current expenditure turned out to be  fully   effective,   the   deficit   might   be   lower   than    forecast.  The  possible  postponement  of  expenditure   linked  to  the  Lisbon  agen da  to  2007  might  also   improve  the  2006  deficit  figure.  On  the  other  hand,   even  the  attainment  of  the  sizable  savings  on  current   expenditure   included   in   the   Commission   services    forecasts   might   prove   challenging   to   carry-out.    Moreover,  the  cuts  in   transfers  to  p ublicly-owned  companies  may  be  difficult   to  sustain  given  their   current  financial  needs.  Finally,  the  2006  budgetary   forecast   incorporates   measures   announced   by   the    Government but not yet approved by Parliament.   The  forecast  for  2007  of  a  deficit  of  4.6%  of  GDP  is   based on the customary no-policy-change assumption,  i.e.  only  measures  already  formally  adopted  by  the   government are taken into account.   The  government  debt  ratio  is  forecast  to  increase  to   108.6%  of  GDP  in  2005,  up  from  106.5%  in  2004,   thus  interrupting  the  d ecline  started  in  1995.  The   negative   impact   of   debt-increasing   below-the-line    operations is expected to  more than offset the positive  effect from privatisation receipts estimated at 0.3% of  GDP  in  2005.  Planned  privatisation  receipts  of  about   1% of GDP will contribute to th e decline in the debt- to-GDP ratio in 2006. 		
November/2005	Cyprus	Steady growth and fiscal consolidation 	Activity in 2005  In  line  with  the  strong  growth  performance  recorded   in   2004,   when   GDP   growth   picked   up   to   3.8%,    growth  in  the  first  two  quarters  2005  reached  3.8%   and    3.5%    year-on-year    respectively.    Economic     activity  continued  to  be  mainly  driven  by  domestic   demand,   notably   private   sector   consumption   and    investment,    including    co nstruction.    Concurrently,     external   demand   recovered   as,   inter   alia,   tourism    arrivals  rose  by  6.4%  for  the   first  nine  months,  up   from  growth  rates  recorded  in  previous  years,  while   import growth decelerated following the import spike  in 2004. Surveys indicate a  continued po sitive outlook  for tourism arrivals for the remainder of the year.   With  uncertainties  on  oil  price  developments  and   restrained EU growth prospe cts, the outlook for GDP  growth  for  2005  as  a  whole  is   set  at  3.9%,  similar  to   2004’s.  Domestic  private  sector  demand  growth  is   projected  to  slow  down  after  the   surge  in  2004  but   remains a main growth f actor, supported by a rebound  in   net   external   demand.   Consumption   growth   is    projected at 4.3%, in line with wage and employment  growth.   After   strong   growth   in   2004,   investment    expansion remains relatively bu oyant at 4.5%, linked,  inter   alia,   to   a   more   compe titive   environment    following   EU   accession.   Interest   rates   have   been    lowered by a total of 125 basis points so far this year,  before and after smooth entry in ERM II in May 2005;  lower  rates  also  should  help  stimulate  demand.  The   growth   contribution   from   net   external   demand   is    forecast  to  turn  positive  through  a  strengthening  in   exports  and  deceleration  in  import  growth  after  the   rush   in   2004   linked   to   strong   domestic   demand    expansion   and   one-off   factors   (reduction   in   car    excises). However, high ener gy import price rises put  upward  pressure  on  nominal  import  growth  and  the   current account deficit is expected to increase slightly  to 5.8% of GDP.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Based  on  a  continuation  of  the  demand  factors  noted   for  2005,  the  forecast  projects  for  2006  and  2007  a   marginal  strengthening  of  GDP  growth  to  4.0%  and   4.2%,   respectively.   Private   sector   consumption   is    foreseen   to   increase   by   abou t   4%   both   years,    consistent  with  wage  de velopments  and  employment   growth.  Investment  growt h  is  expected  to  remain   strong at 5% by 2007. Public consumption is assumed  to     increase     relatively     modestly,     by     2-2.7%,      throughout.  With  a  m oderately  positive  EU  growth   outlook,   export   gr owth   is   projected   to   strengthen    somewhat  in  both  years,   with  similar  tourism  arrival   growth  rates  as  in  2005  and  robust  growth  in  non- tourist services. Import growth is expected to pick up  with  domestic  demand  in  2006  and  2007,  while  high   oil  prices  further  push  nominal   imports.  Altogether,   the  forecast  projects  a  slight  decline  in  the  current   account deficit to below 5% of GDP by 2007. Deficit  financing  through  FDI  and  portfolio  investment  is   expected to remain unproblematic.  Costs and prices, labour market  HICP  inflation  for  the  first  nine  months  of  2005   reached  2.1%  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2004.   This  is  marginally  above   the  2004  rate  at  1.9%,   mainly  as  a  result  of  higher  energy  prices,  but  still   slightly below the project ed rise of 2.3% for the year.  In  2006  and  2007  in flation  is  expected  to  gradually   weaken  again  to  around  2.1%  as  oil  price  pressures   abate. In May 2005 Cyprus successfully entered ERM  II.  Following  significant   capital  inflows  interest  rates   were    lowered    twice,    while    the    Cyprus    pound     remained   in   the   upper    fluctuation   margin   limits.    Overall, the real effective exchange rate has tended to  appreciate  in  the  wake  of  some  inflation  pressures   (mainly one-off, through  VAT increases linked to EU  harmonisation),       leading       to       some       price- competitiveness loss.   With steady GDP growth,  unemployment is projected  to  inch  down  to  4.8%  this  year,  from  a  peak  of  5.1%   last  year,  and  to  further  diminish  to  4.5%  by  2007.  Wage   moderation   in   the   public   sector   and   an    increasing  share  of  foreign  labour  (currently  about   14%   of   the   total   labour    force,   which   includes    commuting   Turkish   Cypriot   workers)   continue   to    exert  some  downward  pressure  on  wages,  which  are   expected  to  increase  between  1.5-2.0%  in  real  terms,   in  line  with  policy  to   keep  real  wage  growth  below   expected  productivity  growt h,  leading  to  real  unit   labour cost decreases of 0.4%-1.0%.   Public finances  Government  revenues  in   Jan-August  2005   increased   by 17% and expenditure by 7%, leading to a balanced  budget   for   the   period   (cash-basis).   This   can   be    attributed to the ongoing impact of one-off (especially  tax  amnesty)  but  also  structural  fiscal  consolidation   measures  on  expenditure  and  revenue  sides.  While   revenues  were  also  supported  by  a  domestic-demand   based   growth   composition,   leading   to   extra   tax    revenues,  major  parts  of  payments  associated  with   expenditure  are  made  toward  year-end.  Based  on  the   above,  together  with  the  base-year  effect  of  a  better- than-expected   2004   deficit    reduction   to   a   total    adjustment  of  2.2  percentage  points  and  successful   negotiations with social par tners on a few key planned  consolidation measures, the forecast projects a deficit  decline  to  below  3%  of   GDP  this  year,  in  line  with   convergence    programme    commitments.    On    an     unchanged  policy  basis,  and  corrected  for  one-off   (revenue)  measures,  a  similar  deficit  is  projected  for   2006,   declining   somewhat   by   2007.   Given   these    narrow margins, it remains im portant to keep up fiscal  consolidation effo rts unabatedly.   On  the  same  assumption,   debt  is  projected  to  decline   from  72%  of  GDP  in  2004  to  below  68%  by  2007,   reflecting  mostly  the  effects  of   improved  primary   balances already from 2005. 		
November/2005	Latvia	Growth fever 	According to preliminary national accounts, real GDP  growth reached an all-time-high in the second quarter,  registering 11.6% year-on-year after an already robust  7.4% in the previous quarter. In the first half of 2005,  domestic demand remained high and external demand  accelerated.   Judging   from   retail   trade   turnover,    consumer  demand  continues  to  expand  at  a  steady   rate,  fuelled  by  better  access  to  consumer  credit  and   significant   increases   in   real   disposable   income.    Investment  grew  very  fast,  re flecting  strong  demand   for   equipment   and   continued   buoyancy   in   the    construction     sector.     Export     performance     was      particularly  strong  in  the  f irst  half  of  2005.  Export   values  grew  by  more  than  30  percent  year-on-year,   outpacing imports, which grew by around 25 percent.  Even  though,  th e  external  deficit  rema ins  large,  the   contribution  to  GDP  growth  of  net  exports  will  be   negligible.  Overall,  the  prospects  for  th e  economy  in  the  second   half    of    2005    remain    positive.    The    economy’s     momentum   is   supported    by   significant   EU-funds- related  activity,  increased  labour  participation  and   declining  unemployment.  For  the  year  as  a  whole,   GDP  is  estimated  to  grow   by  around  9%,  just  above   the 8.3% recorded in 2004.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Growth prospects fo r 2006-2006 are also  strong, with  an  expected  expansion  exceeding  7%  in  both  years,   close  to  the  growth  of  potential  output.  However,  if   rate  and  quality  of  investmen t  (thus  contributing  to   maintaining   high   pr oductivity  growth)   were   not    achieved   as   assumed,   there   would   be   significant    downward  risks  to  the  sustai nability  of  expansion  at   the rates foreseen.  Final  domestic  demand  is  expected  to  continue  to   drive   growth,   primarily    led   by   investment,   with    housing   construction   increasing   strongly.   Private    consumption is also expected to remain strong, largely  because  of  employment  growth,  substantially  higher   real  wages  and  better  access  to  consumer  credit.  The   continued  low  cost  base  and  growing  productivity   mainly  due  to  high  levels   of  investment  will  boost   export  growth.  Import  growth   is  also  expected  to   remain  robust  due  to  the  increase  of  investment  and   intermediate   goods.    Although   import   growth   is    projected   to   slow   somewhat,   narrowing   the   trade    deficit,  the  negative  net  co ntribution  to  GDP  growth   from  trade  is  expected  to  widen  again  in  both  2006   and 2007. Throughout the forecast period, the current  account deficit is expected to narrow only marginally.  Labour market, costs and prices  High  growth  has  contributed  to  boost  employment   and   to   reduce   unempl oyment.   In   line   with   the    projected expansion of const ruction output and strong  performance  of  the  service  s ector,  employment  gains   are likely to remain robust  in 2006 and  2007. Labour  force   growth,   after   taking   account   of   significant    outward  migration  (chiefly  to  the  old  EU  Member   States) and negative demographi c  trends,  is  projected   to   remain   sluggish.   The   unemployment   rate   is    estimated  to  decrease  steadily.  Active  employment   measures   may   provide   some   help   in   softening    considerable regional develop ment  disparities.  In  line   with  the  data  for  the  fi rst  half  of  2005,  per  capita   compensation is estimated to pick up sharply in 2005.  Wages are expected to continue growing rapidly over  the next couple of years. Pro ductivity growth in most  industries will remain faster than that of wages.  Since July 2004 HICP inflation in  Latvia has been the  highest  among  the  Member  States;  core  inflation  has   also  been  progressively   increasing.  Thr oughout  2005   a  sharp  pick-up  in  infla tion  has  been  reflected  in  all   indices,   with   that   for   producer   prices   outpacing    consumer prices. Several external factors (e.g. high oil  prices and the relatively high exchange rate peg) have  contributed  to  price  growth.   Food  prices  continue  to   increase  at  a  high  rate.  Administrative  price  changes   were  less  important  in  the   first  half  of  2005,  though  newly  approved  gas  tariffs  will  intensify  the  pressure   in  the  second  half.  The   main  risk  to  the  inflation   outlook is that price increases could become persistent  if  strong  demand  continues  to  drive  output  above   potential and feeds into in flation expectations. Taking  this  into  account,  the  current  prospect  is  for  HICP   inflation for 2005 of around 6¾%, and only modestly  lower in 2006.  Public finances  Generally,  owing  to  the  strong  growth,  fiscal  targets   have  been  met  or  even  exceeded.  In  2005,  the  latest   figures  confirm  that  the  budge t  is  so  far  strongly  in   surplus  vis-à-vis  a  defic it  target  of  1.6%  of  GDP  for   the year as a whole. However, budgetary amendments  adopted  in  August  foresee   increases  in  spending  of   about 1½% of GDP and will br ing the deficit close to  the  official  target.  The  authorities  plan  a  significant   increase in investment, largely based on higher levels  of EU financial aid, which has been rising since 2004.  The 2006 budget law  provides for a  17.6% increase in  expenditure  and  a  19.2%  increase  in  revenue.  The   attainment  of  the  1.5%  of  GDP  deficit  target  seems   plausible   given   the   growth    and   inflation   outlook.    However,  the  2006  budg et  will  not  allow  a  mid-year   opening to increase expenditure as has been common  in previous years. All together, the deficit is expected  to  remain  at  around  1.5%   of  GDP  in  2006-2007.   Government debt is projected  to remain below 15% of  GDP over the forecast period. 		
November/2005	Lithuania	Slower, but still robust growth 	Output is estimated to have grown by 6.4% in the first  half of 2005, with domestic demand remaining as the  main  driver  for  growth.  Preliminary  data  point  that   growth  accelerated  to  7.6%  in  the  third  quarter  of   2005 year-on-year.  A  deceleration  of  investment  growth  in  the  first  half   of  2005  is  seen  as  temp orary,  and  investment  is   expected to lead growth in the whole 2005. Consumer  spending is forecast to remain strong, as suggested by  high  growth  of  retail  sales  and  bank  credit.  A  drag   from  net  trade  continued  in   the  first  half  of  2005  as   import growth remained str ong. But ex ports increased  significantly,   stimulated   by    strong   growth   in   the    Commonwealth   of   Independent   States   (CIS)   and    despite   a   sharp   drop   in   electricity   exports   from    Ignalina   Nuclear   Power   Plant   (Lithuania’s   major    power producer).   Growth prospects in  2006 and 2007  Output   growth   is   expected   to   gradually   weaken    although remaining at around 6% and becoming more  balanced.  Domestic  demand  re mains  the  main  driver,   despite  a  slowdown  led  by  lower  growth  of  private   investment and consumption.  Investment is nevertheless e xpected to lead growth in  2005-2007,   aided   by   EU   funds   and   favourable    financial  conditions  for  pri vate  investment.  In  2006- 2007,  the  reduction  of  the   personal  income  tax  and   higher   disposab le   income   growth   are   likely   to    stimulate  consumption,  thou gh  a  weaker  growth  rate   than  in  previous  years  is  assumed  as  bank  credit   growth moderates.    Import growth is forecast to stabilise in 2006-2007 at  around  11%  after  slowing  down  in  2005.  Export   growth  is  expected  to  p ick  up  significantly  in  2005   and maintain the impetus in 2006-2007, aided by high  import  growth  in  some  of  Lithuania’s  main  trading   partners  (the  CIS  and  neighbouring  EU  countries).   The  negative  contribution  of  net  trade  to  growth  is   expected  to  remain  broadly  unchanged,  though  an   improvement in the terms of trade leads to a reduction  of the current account deficit to about 7% of GDP by  2007.   Lithuania’s   net   borro wing   position   in   the    balance  of  payments  is  anticip ated  to  fall  to  about   5.3%  of  GDP  in  2007,  due   to  the  positive  impact  of   increasing capital transfers from the EU.   Labour market, costs and prices  The  12-month  average  HICP  inflation  accelerated  to   2.7%  in  September  2005,   mostly  reflecting  rising   energy,  health-care,  transport  and  some  food  prices.   However, monthly y-o-y inflation in the period May– September 2005 turn ed out lower than  expected in the  Commission  services  2005  spring  forecast,  as  core   inflation remained low and one-off effects that created  inflation  pressures  in  May  2004  started  fading  away   more  rapidly  than  foreseen.  Thus,  the  annual  average   HICP  inflation  forecast  for  2005  is  revised  down  to   2.6% (from 2.9% in spring).  In 2006, inflation is projected to edge up to 2.8%. An  initial  slowdown,  due  to  fad ing  one-off  effects  that   arose  in  the  early  months  of   2005,  is  expected  to  be   followed  by  an  acceleration  in  the  second  half  of  the   year. Inflation is foreseen to in crease to 2.9% in 2007.  Core  inflation  is  expected  to  remain  low  and  rapid   productivity  growth  is  likely   to  continue  over  the   forecast  period,  but  oil  prices,  several  services  prices   and  wage  growth  are  assumed  to  remain  high.  Risks   to the inflation pr ojections are on the upside. High oil  prices  and  a  strong  reaction  of  wages  and  prices  to   demand  growth  are  the  main  threats,  together  with  a   potential   increase   in   gas   prices,   which   is   being    considered by Lithuania’s single gas supplier.  Employment  growth  picked  up  in  the  first  half  of   2005, while the unemploymen t rate declined further to  below  10%.  The  labour  market  continued  tightening   and   earnings   started   accelerating   rapidly.   Some    sectors  are  experiencing  problems   to  balance  supply   and   demand   of   labour,   reinforced   by   emigration.   Structural  unemployment  is  high  and  thus  the  high   unemployment rate is not  very indicative of available  labour resources.  Employment  growth  is  anticip ated  to  peak  in  2005   and  remain  positive  over  the  forecast  horizon.  The   labour   market   is   likely   to    continue   tightening.    Nominal wage growth is expe cted to remain above the  moderate  trend  of  last  years  and  surpass  productivity   growth. Current active labour market measures should  improve  labour  availability,  but   are  unlikely  to  offset   labour   market   imbalances    in   the   short   term.   A    personal  income  tax  cut  in   July  2006  is  expected  to   slow  down  wage  growth  in  2006-2007,  reducing  the   gap   with   productivity   gains   and   moderating   the    impact on unit labour costs.   Public finances  Methodological  changes  regarding  the  classification   of  compensation  for  lost  (rouble)  savings  and  real   estate  restitutions  resulted  in   a  downward  revision  of   the  government  deficits  in   previous  years.  A  tax   reform  was  approved  last  June.  Personal  income  tax   will be lowered in two steps  from the present 33% to  24%   in   2008.   The   corporate   profit   tax   will   be    temporarily  increased  to  19%  in   2006,  but  will  fall   back  to  the  present  15%  in  2008.  A  new  tax  on  real   estate was approved, but it is still unclear how it will  be   applied.   The   general   government   deficit   is    projected  to  increase  from  1.4%  of  GDP  in  2004  to   2%  in  2005,  mostly  due   to  salary  increases  in  the   public   sector,   higher   pension   benefits   and   rising    investment.   The   deficit   is   forecast   to   decrease    gradually to about 1.6% of GD P in 2007, on the back  of  robust  tax  revenue  growth.  The  impact  of  the  tax   reform  is  likely  to  be  broad ly  neutral  until  2007,  due   to the temporary increase of the corporate tax. 		
November/2005	Luxembourg	Healthy growth but some clouds on the horizon 	The  Luxembourg  economy  has  performed  well  in   2005  and  real  GDP  growth  should  reach  more  than   4%, only slightly less than th e 4.5% recorded in 2004.  The  financial  sector  value  added  has  risen  by  more   than   6%,   thanks   to   th e   good   health   of   financial    markets. Industry has performed well too, even if the  figures  might  be  somewhat  inflated  by  the  strong   growth  of  the  energy  sector .  Hotels  and  restaurants   benefited from the fact that Luxembourg held the EU  presidency  in  the  first  half  of  the  year.  On  the  other   hand,    retail    trade    is    stagnating,    reflecting    the     weakness of private consumption.  Domestic  demand  has  been  rather  subdued  in  2005,   with  private  consumption  growing  by  hardly  more   than  1%.  Although  unempl oyment  remains  relatively   low  by  EU  standards,  its  rise  in  recent  years  is  likely   to  negatively  affect  consumer  confidence.  Similarly,   gross  fixed  capital  formation  grew  by  merely  1½%.   Only    housing    showed    some    buoyancy,    while     investment  by  the  government  and  enterprises  was   weak.      Actually,   growth   in   2005   was   chiefly    supported  by  external  trade,  especially  in  services,   with  both  exports  and  im ports  of  services  rising  by   about 10% in real terms.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  GDP growth should slightly accelerate to about 4½%  in 2006 and 2007: the  external sector will probably be  less  supportive  than  in  2005  but  domestic  demand   should be more dynamic. Pri vate consumption should  accelerate despite the projected rise in unemployment:  wage  increases  are  projected  between  2.5%  and  3%   and  residents  employment  is  forecast  to  rise  by  1½%   to    1¾%    a    year    over    the    forecasting    period..     Consequently,    the    increase    in    real    households     disposable  income  will  not  be  negligible  despite  the   relatively   high   inflation   recorded   in   2005   and    projected    for    2006    Similarly,    investment    by     enterprises, which has been ve ry subdued in 2004 and  2005  should  accelerate  appreciably  in  response  to   rapid  output  growth.  The  more  dynamic  domestic   demand  should  also  lead  to  a  significant  acceleration   in  imports,  which  explai ns  for  a  part  why  external   trade will be less supportive.  Labour market, costs and prices   Reflecting  the  strong  growt h  in  output,  employment   rose by about 3% this y ear. However, unemployment  kept  rising:  with  a  5.3  %      unemployment  rate  this   year,   the   Grand-Duchy   no   longer   has   the   lowest    unemployment  in  the  EU.  Once  again,  job  creation   mostly  benefited  non-residents,  whose  number  rose   by   nearly   6%   while   resi dents   employment   only    increased  by  about  1½%.  This  discrepancy  probably   reflects  mismatches  between  the  skills  (or  absence   thereof)  of  unemployed  residents  and  those  required   by the jobs created but it might  also be the result of a  significantly higher reserva tion wage in Luxembourg,  related  to  the  high  level  of   wages  and  the  generosity   of the social security system. Due to this bias towards  non-residents,  it  increasingly   seems  that  employment   has  to  rise  by  more  than  3½%  a  year  in  Luxembourg   for unemployment to stabilise. Employment growth is  projected  to  accelerate  over  the  forecast  period  but   probably  not  enough  to  prevent  unemployment  from   continuing  to  rise,  albeit  at  a  slower  pace.  Moreover,   like  in  recent  years,  the  rise  in  domestic  employment   should  considerably  outpace  the  increase  in  resident   employment.  Inflation  considerably  accelerated  in  the  course  of   2005, mostly as a result of the surge in oil prices, with  the yearly rise in the HICP reaching 5.0% in October.  The  national  CPI,  which  excludes  consumption  by   non-residents  and  especially   their  large  purchases  of   car fuel, alcohol and tobacco products, neared 3%. In  yearly  averages,  the  HICP  should  increase  by  more   than 4% and the national CPI by more than 2½% this  year. However, underlying inflation remains moderate  and  is  even  decelerating.  Inflation  is  also  expected  to   slow  down  during  the  projection  period.  However,  due  to  the  large  carry  ov er  effect,  both  the  national   CPI and the HICP could post higher annual increases  in  2006  than  in   2005.  In  2007,  on  the  contrary,  both   indexes are projected to decelerate significantly to the  neighbourhood   of   2%,   as   underlying   inflation   is    expected to remain moderate.  Public finance  Since  record  surpluses  were  registered  in  2000  and   2001   (6.1%   and   6.5%   of   GDP   respectively),   the    position     of     general     government     finance     has      continuously  deteriorated.  It  posted  a  1.2%  of  GDP   deficit  in  2004.  This  deficit   probably  deepened  to   about  2.3%  of  GDP  in   2005  despite  strong  GDP  and   employment  growth.  Beside  the  rapid  increase  in   expenditure   (+8.0%   for   current   expenditure   and    +8.6%  for  total  expenditure),  th e  main  factor  behind   this  deterioration  was  a  ve ry  large  shortfall  in  VAT   revenues.  According  to   the  latest  estimates,  these   VAT  revenues  should  be  ab out  540  millions  euros   (27%  of  total  planned  revenues  and  2%  of  GDP)   lower  than  projected  in  th e  2005  budg et.  Clearly,  the   weakness  in  private  consumption  may  have  played  a   role   in   this   shortfall   but,   according   to   the   latest    available information, it a ppears that the largest part is  due to massive and unexpected  VAT reimbursements.     Since  this  VAT  shortfall  is  not  expected  to  repeat   itself in 2006, the rise in rev enues should significantly  accelerate  next  year  and  the  deficit  should  improve   somewhat   despite   a   continuously   rapid   rise   in    expenditure.   However,   at   unchanged   policy,   the    deficit  should  deteriorate  again   in  2007,  despite  the   strong   growth   in   GDP   and   employment,   as   the    increase  in  expenditure  is  projected  to  remain  faster   than the rise in revenues. 		
November/2005	Hungary	Repeatedly missed deficit target 	After a vigorous expansion in the second half of 2004,  real  GDP  growth  slowed  do wn  to  2.9%  year-on-year   in  the  first  quarter  of  2005.  This  was  the  weakest   growth rate since the th ird quarter of  2003, reflecting  the weakening of export demand largely explained by  the  deterioration  of  the  growth  outlook  for  the  main   EU  trading  partners.  In   the  second  quarter  of  2005   GDP growth picked up agai n and grew by 4.1% year- on-year. The main driver behind GDP growth was the  strong  performance  in  gros s  fixed  capital  formation   and  net  exports.  Most  of  the  increase  in  gross  capital   formation    was    realised    in    public    infrastructure     investment.   Annual   real   GD P   growth   in   2005   is    expected to remain around 3.7%.  The   current   account   deficit   is   estimated   to   have    remained  close  to  8%  of  GDP  in  2005,  increasingly   financed  by  non-debt-creating   inflows,  mainly  due  to   the larger share of EU funds in the capital account.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  GDP   growth   is   projected   to   remain   firm   in   the    forecast   period   due   to   stable   demand   and   export    conditions.  The  composition   of  growth  continues  to   be   favourable,   supported   by   dynamic   investment    activity,  improving  external  demand  conditions  and   moderate  consumption  growth.  Private  consumption   growth  is  projected  to  increase   slightly  in  2006,  to   about  3.5%,  fuelled  by  fiscal  measures,  notably  the   reduction of the highest VAT rate of 25% to 20%, and  to stabilise around this rate in 2007.  Export growth is expected to  remain steady during the  forecast  period.  Investments  will  continue  to  benefit   from  extensive  highway  co nstructions  in  2006  and   2007.  Military  expenditure  amounting  to  0.5%  of   GDP  will  be  reflected  in  increased  imports  in  both   2006 and 2007.   Due to the fiscal expansion the current account deficit  will decline only slightly.  Labour market, costs and prices  Employment, still stagnating  in the first half of 2005,  is   expected   to   rise   by   about   0.5%   in   2006   and    somewhat  less  in  2007 .  Real  wage  growth  will  ease   due to tighter labour mark et conditions. After a sharp  increase  in  the  final  quarter  of  2004  and  the  first   quarter of 2005, the unempl oyment rate is projected to  increase,  partly  due  to  the  stagnating  labour  demand.   The inflation trend remains  favourable, backed by the  slowdown  of  wage  increases,  the  strong  value  of  the   forint  and  the  intensifying   competition  following  EU   accession. Annual consumer price inflation is forecast  to  decelerate  sharply  to  about  2%  in  2006.  This  is   supported  by  the  cut  in   the  VAT  rate  and  benign   inflation expectations. It is  projected to return to about  3%  in  2007,  with  faster  con sumption  growth  and  the   rise  in  the  minimum  wage  posing  a  possible  upside   risk.   Public finances  Hungarian  deficit  figures  have  been  characterised  by   their regular ex-post upward  revision due to statistical  reclassifications.    Mainly    as    a    result    of    the     reclassification of 13th month public sector salary, the  2004  deficit  has  recently  been  revised  from  4.5%  to   5.4% 1   of  GDP.  Even  taking  into  account  the  higher   2004 base level,  the 2005 deficit is expanding.   In  2005,  the  original  de ficit  target  of  3.6%  of  GDP   will  be  significantly  missed  for  the  fourth  year  in  a   row with an expect ed outcome of above 6% of GDP,  despite  some  corrective  measu res  taken  in  the  first   half  of  the  year.  The  main  reason  for  this  marked   deviation  is  a  recent  statistical  clarification  regarding   the  planned  sale  of  motorways  worth  almost  2%  of   GDP,  which  does  not  reduce  the  general  government   deficit   as   previously   assumed   by   the   Hungarian    authorities. In addition, a  significant rev enue shortfall  based on overly optimistic  budget assumptions and an  expenditure  overrun  due  to  the  underestimation  of  open  ceiling  expenditures,  lead ing  to  an  additional   slippage  of  0.5%  of  GDP  was  acknowledged  by  the   Hungarian  authorities,  without  deciding  on  corrective   measures contrary to previous commitments.   For   2006,   the   authorities   have   submitted   a   draft    budget  of  4.7%  of  GDP  which  does  not  include  the   appropriate  recording  of  military  aircraft  delivery  in   2006.  This  is  compared  to   a  deficit  target  of  2.9%  of   GDP contained in the c onvergence programme update  of December 2004. In this forecast the 2006 deficit is  projected  to  be  even  higher,  reaching  6.7%  of  GDP.   The  draft  2006  budget  lacks  significant  structural   reforms   targeting   expe nditure   reduction,   while   it    includes relevant tax cuts worth of about 1% of GDP,  mainly on VAT 2 . No significant changes are projected  for  the  macroeconomic  environment  in  2007.  Due  to   the  second  step  of  the   tax  cut  programme  the  deficit   increases  even  further  to  6.9%  of  GDP.  The  forecast   assumes  that  the  accounting  of  military  fighters  will   increase  the  deficit  by  ½  percentage  point  of  GDP  in   both   2006   and   2007,   while   new   public–private    motorway  investment  projects  worth  about  1%  of   GDP  will  reduce  the  general  government  deficit.  The   latter assumption is subject to risk.  In  the  light  of  increasing   yearly  deficit  levels,  the   debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  expected  to  almost  reach  the   60% threshold by 2007. 		
November/2005	Malta	Capital transfers sustain growth	Sluggish growth continued in  the first quarter of 2005,  but  the  acceleration  of  public  investment  brought   about  a  rebound  in  the  sec ond  quarter.  GDP  is  now   projected to grow slightly below 1% for the year as a  whole.  Private  and  public   consumption  are  expected   to   remain   negative,   falling   by   0.8%   and   1.9%,    respectively. The contraction of public consumption is  the   consequence   of   ongoin g   fiscal   consolidation.    Investment  will  remain  the  most  dynamic  component   of  domestic  demand,  projected   to  grow  by  around   10%.  The  buoyant  performan ce  of  investment  in  the   midst of stagnation in the rest of the Maltese economy  is due to the implementati on of infrastructure projects  financed  by  EU  Structural  Funds  and  public  works   funded through th e Italian Protocol,  which consists of  grants    from    the    Italian    government    for    major     infrastructure  projects.  As  in   previous  years,  the  high   level of public investment  reflects the building of the  Mater  Dei  Hospital,  which  is  now   in  its  final  stages.   This     specific     growth     com position,     which     is      particularly based on civil construction works, largely  explains  why  high  investment  growth  is  unrelated  to   any   other   demand   component.   Overall,   domestic    demand is projected to cont ribute 1.2 pps to growth.  Exports  are  expected  to  drop  by  around  2½%.  This   contraction  is  partly  explained   by  sluggish  growth  of   Malta’s  main  trade  partners,  having  a  particularly   significant  impact  on  the  stagnation  of  the  tourism   sector.    In    addition,    low    productivity    growth,     especially  in  the  produc tion  of  semiconductors,  is   weighing   on   exports   of   goods.   Imports   are   also    projected  to  contract,  by  around  2%,  due  to  weak   consumption  and  private  investment,  and  to  the  low   import-intensity  of  infrastructu re  investment.  As  a   result,   the   contribution   of    the   external   sector   to    growth is estimated at -0 .3 of a percentage point.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  GDP  growth  is  projected  to   slightly  decelerate  to   0.7%   in   2006   and,   then,   to   accelerate   to   a   still    moderate rate of 1.1% in  2007. A modest recovery is  projected  for  both  private  and  public  consumption.   Specifically,  private  consumption  is  expected  to  gain   momentum and increase by 0.6% in 2006 and 0.9% in  2007. This small recovery of private consumption can  be explained by a slight rise  in disposable income, in  turn  supported  by  a  still-hig h-job-content  of  growth   over  the  forecast  horizon.  After  a  period  of  strong   fiscal  consolidation,  public  consumption  growth  is   projected to increase by 1.1% in 2006 and by 1.3% in  2007.  While  growing  at   lower  rates  than  in  2005,   investment  growth  should  re main  strong.  However,   this  deceleration  reflects  the  finalization  of  a  number   of   infrastructure   projects   in    the   next   two   years.    Overall, the contribution of  domestic demand to GDP  growth should be around 1½ pps in both years.  Exports  are  expected  to  rebound  moderately  in  2006   and  accelerate  in  2007.  This  rebound  should  largely   be     supported     by     better     prospects     for     the      semiconductor   and   touris m   sectors.   Imports   are    expected  to  be  slightly  more   dynamic  than  exports,   due  to  the  recovery  of  consumption.  Consequently,   the negative contribution of the external sector would  reach 0.7 pp in 2006 and 0.6 pp in 2007.   The  current  account  deficit   is  set  to  attain  6.8%  of   GDP in 2006, slightly higher th an in 2005 (6.7%), and  to    worsen    to    7%    in    2007.    Current    account     developments  mirror  those  of  the  trade  deficit,  which   should  reach  17%  of  GDP  at  the  end  of  the  forecast   period,  while  the  traditional   surplus  in  the  services   balance should remain  fairly stable at around 8½% of  GDP.  This  deficit  is  set  to  be   only  partially  financed   by  roughly  constant  capital  transfers  from  the  EU  in   nominal   terms.   Accordingly,   the   net   borrowing    position of the country is proj ected to widen from 4%  in 2005 to around  6% of GDP in 2007.  Labour market, costs and prices  Despite  slow  GDP  growth,  employment  is  projected   to  keep  rising,  largely  owing  to  the  ongoing  labour-intensive   infrastructure    projects.   In   parallel,   the    unemployment  rate  should  marginally  fall  to  6.8%  in   2007.  With  sluggish  growt h,  inflationary  pressures   come  only  from  the  energy  prices  increase:  HICP   inflation is projected to decline from 3.1% this year to  2.6%  in  2006  and  2.2%  at  the  end  of  the  forecast   period.  Unit  labour  costs  are  expected  to  grow  by   2.3%  in  2006  (1.3%  in  2005),  reflecting  oil  prices   increase,  but  should  ease  again  to  1.3%  in  2007,  in   line with more stable energy prices.   Public finances  After  declining  to  5.1%   of  GDP  in  2004,  the  2005   deficit  is  expected  to  fall   to  4.2%  of  GDP.  Although   Malta  is  implementing  the  measures  planned  in  the   2005  budget,  in cluding  expenditure  cuts  and  revenue   enhancing     measures,     lower-than-expected     GDP      growth is an obstacle to the achievement of the deficit  target set up in the Converg ence Programme for 2005.  Under   a   no-policy   change   scenario,   the   general    government deficit is set to decrease to 3.0% of GDP  in  2006  and  to  2.5%  of  GDP  in  2007.  The  projection   for    capital    expenditu res    incorporates    the    fall     associated with the finalization of  the Italian protocol.   The   general   government   gross   debt   in   2005   is    expected  to  remain  at  around  77%  of  GDP,  slightly   above  its  2004  lev el.  This  figure  tak es  into  account   the    effect    of    the    privatization    of    the    Malta     International    Airport,    to    be    accomplished    in     November  2005.  At  unch anged  legislation,  the  debt- to-GDP  ratio  is  expected   to  rise  slightly  to  around   77½%   of   GDP   in   2006,   bu t   a   growing   primary    balance should lead to  slight decrease in 2007 (77%).  These  debt  figures  do  no t  take  on  board  the  potential   effects of additional pri vatisation projects. 		
November/2005	Netherlands	The end of the tunnel, at last? 	After  a  sharp  and  protracted   slowdown  from  2001  to   2003  and  a  short-lived  recovery  in  2004,  2005  was   another  gloomy  year  for  the  Netherlands.  In  the  first   quarter of the year real GDP  fell by 0.8% quarter-on- quarter but it strongly recovered in the second quarter  (+1.2%  quarter-on-quarter)  a nd  this  recovery  should   continue in the second  half of the year. Nevertheless,  on  average,  real  GDP  growth   in  2005  will  probably   not exceed ½%, down from 1.7% in 2004.  Private  consumption,  which  declined  in  2003  and   stagnated  in  2004,  is  expected  to  decrease  again  this   year,  by  about  ¼%.  The  main  reason  was  a  further   decline  in  households’  disposable  income,  by  nearly   1%  in  real  terms,  due  to  the  continuing  decline  in   employment,   renewed   wage   moderation   after   the    excessive  wage  increases  of  the  late  1990s  and  early   2000s,   and   a   fall   in    non-labour   income.   Public    consumption     stagnated     and     public     investment      declined by about ¾%, reflecting the continuing effort  to  further  reduce  the  government  deficit.  Gross  fixed   capital  formation  by  corporations  was  nearly  flat  but   investment in dwelling s still increased by 3%.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  GDP growth is expected to accelerate in the course of  2005.  It  is  projected  to  r each  about  2%  in  2006  and   about  2½%  in  2007,  essentially  because  domestic   demand should be significantly more dynamic than in  recent years. Developments in both private and public  consumption  next  year  are   blurred  by  the  reform  of   the health care system on 1  January 2006, which will  result  in  a  shift  from  the   former  to  the  latter  of  about   1.7%  of  GDP.  This  instituti onal  change  is  the  main   reason   why   private   consumption   is   expected   to    decrease  by  about  3%  in  real  terms  and  government   consumption to rise by  more than 9% next year. This  shift  apart,  private  consumption   should  rise  by  about   ½%  in  2006  as  households’  gross  disposable  income   will  broadly  stabilise  in  real  terms  after  several  years   of  decline.  In  2 007,  private  consumption  is  set  to   accelerate   to   around   2%:   households’   disposable    income  should  rise  significantly,   for  the  first  time  in   years, essentially due to the recovery in employment;  on  the  other  hand,  their  sa ving  rate,  which  dropped   considerably  in  recent  years  and  thereby  supported   consumption, is expected to rise again.   Government  consumption  should  increase  by  nearly   2%  in  volume  (without  th e  effects  of  the  health  care   reform)  in  2006  and  by  about  3%  in  2007.  While   government investment should still stagnate next year,  gross   fixed   capital   formation   by   corporations   is    forecast  to  begin  to  recover,  rising  by  about  6½%  in   2006,  but  this  relatively   high  figure  is  inflated  by   some  large  projects  in  the  transport  sector.  In  2007,   both government and private investment are projected  to speed up in line with the acceleration in growth.  Exports   of   goods   and   services   are   forecast   to    accelerate  to  more  than  5%  in  2006,  but  to  remain   below  the  expansion  of  ex port  markets  as  the  large   loss   in   competitiveness    recorded   in   recent   years    continues to take its toll.  However, thanks to renewed  wage   moderation,   unit   labour   costs   should   start    declining  again  after  a  slight  surge   in  2005  and  the   gap  between  the  growth  in  exports  and  the  export   market is expected to narrow markedly. Moreover, re- exports,  which  now  represent  nearly  half  of  Dutch   exports of goods, are forecast to remain very dynamic.  In  2007,  export  growth  should  accelerate  to  about   6¾%, close to the rise in exports markets. In parallel,  imports will accelerate too, pushed by the recovery in  domestic  demand  and  by  buoyant  re-exports.  As  a   result,   the   contribution    of   foreign   trade   to   GDP    growth  should  be  significantly  more  limited  in  2006   and  even  more  so  in  2007  than  it  has  been  in  recent   years. Labour markets, costs and prices  Employment   decreased   for   the   fourth   consecutive    year,    by    about    ½%    in    2004.    As    a    result,    unemployment  continued  to  increase  from  5.5%  in   2004  to  about  6%.  With  the  recovery  in  output,   employment  is  also  projected   to  improve,  rising  by   about  ½%  in  2006   and  1%  in  2007.  Unemployment   should  thus  begin  to  d ecline  marginally  in   2006  and   more markedly in 2007.  After  surging  in  the  late  19 90s  and  early  2000s  as  a   result   of   the   overheating    of   the   Dutch   economy,    inflation has considerably decelerated in recent years.  The  HICP  rose  by  1.4%  in  2004.  It  should,  however,   accelerate  this  year  to  about  1.7%,  mostly  as  a  result   of  the  surge  in  oil  prices,  since  wage  increases  are   very  moderate.  Inflation  should  accelerate  to  slightly   above 2% in 2006, due to the remaining impact of oil  prices, before sliding back somewhat in 2007.    Public finances  The  general  government  deficit,  which  was  brought   back  from  3.1%  of  GDP  in  2003  to  2.1%  of  GDP  in   2004,  continued   to  decline,  to  1.8%  of  GDP  in  2005.   In    order    to    support    activity,    and    to    improve     competitiveness  and  households’  purchasing  power,   the  2006  budget  pr ovides  for  cuts  in   taxes  as  well  as   increases  in  spending  for  a  total  of  half  a  percentage   point of GDP. On the other ha nd, the recent rise in oil  prices  will  lead  to  an  increase   in  the  price  of  natural   gas,  which  will  result  in   additional  revenues.  As  a   result, the general governme nt deficit should stabilise  in   2006   at   around   the    2005   level,   despite   the    acceleration  in  GDP  growth.  However,  in  2007,  on   the  assumption  of  unchanged  policy  and  with  faster   output  and  employment  growth,  the  deficit  should   resume its decline and fall below 1½% of GDP. 		
November/2005	Austria	Waiting for private consumption to respond to the tax cuts 	Economic  growth  slowed  down  from  0.4%  quarter- on-quarter  in  late  2004  to  0.1%  in  the  first  three   months  of  2005,  accelerating  again  to  0.4%  in  the   following   period.   Priva te   consumption   had   been    expected  to  grow  significantly   due  to  the  substantial   cuts  in  personal  income  ta xes  introduced  in  early   2005.  However,  this  scenario  did  not  materialise,  as   household  demand  remained  subdued  in  the  first  two   quarters  of  the  year.  Up  to  now,  the  effects  of  rising   oil  prices  seem  to  be  outweighing  the  impact  of  the   expansionary fiscal policy.   As expected, gross fixed cap ital formation slumped in  the   first   half   of   2005,   confirming   that   the   fiscal    investment premium, which had expired in 2004, had  given rise to a good deal  of planned investment being  carried    forward    rather    than     creating    additional     spending.   With   such   weak   domestic   demand,   net    export was again the main  contributor to GDP growth.  In  the  second  half  of  the  year,  growth  is  supposed  to   be  driven  also  by  private  consumption  as  the  effects   of  rising  oil  prices  ebb  away  and  consumers  realise   the benefits of the tax reform. On an annual basis, real  GDP  growth  is  projected  to  decelerate  to  1.7%  in   2005.    Growth prospects fo r 2006 and 2007  Having   slowed   down   signi ficantly   in   2005,   GDP    growth  is  expected  to  accelerate  slightly  in  2006  and   again in 2007, narrowing the negative output gap over  the forecast period.    The  growth  in  private  consumption  is  expected  to   gradually  accelerate  in  2006  and  2007.  However,  it   will still be moderate compared  with historical levels.  Investment  in  construction   is  projected  to  grow  at  a   solid  rate,  supported  by  the  government’s  measures   aimed     at     improving     Austria’s     infrastructure,      undertaken   mainly   in   order   to   address   growing    unemployment.   Equipment   i nvestment,   which   is    expected  to  slump  in  2005  in  the  wake  of  the  expiry   of  the  fiscal  investment   premium,  should  grow  at  a   solid  rate  in  the  near  futu re  on  the  back  of  rising   replacement demand and healthy profits.  Export  growth  is  expected  to  remain  robust,  but  will   not  match  the  level  of  2004,  so  that  over  the  forecast   horizon,  there  should  be  a   shift  from  external  to   domestic demand forces as the main driver of growth.   Labour market, costs and prices  Employment   is   expected   to   grow   throughout   the    forecast period but will be outpaced by the increase in  labour  supply.  The  governm ent’s  special  measures  to   combat  unemployment  are  likely  to  rein  in  the  rising   trend  in  2006,  but  they  will  not  suffice  to  bring  the   record unemployment rate down  from its peak. Due to  the short-term nature of the measures, unemployment  growth is bound to accelerate in 2007.  Consumer  price  inflation  is   projected  to  stay  above   2% in 2005 and 2006. It  should ease down toward the  end  of  the  forecast  period  as  the  effects  of  higher  oil   prices  start  disappearing.  As  wages  are  expected  to   develop   in   line   with   productivity,   no   inflationary    pressures should arise from labour costs.   Public finance  The  second  stage  of  the  2004/2005  tax  reform  came   into force in 2005 . The burden on  the budget incurred  by  the  reform  this  year  is  estimated  at  0.8%  of  GDP,   but tax revenue has so far turned out to be higher than  expected,   mainly   owing   to   higher   proceeds   from    VAT, corporate tax, capital  gains tax and energy tax.   Also   in   2005,   the   government   announced   two    packages   of   special   measures   aimed   at   fighting    unemployment.      The      May      package,      which       concentrated   mainly   on   ra ising   employment   by    renovating  highways,  bridges  and  railways,  will  be   financed  by  the  state-owned  railway  and  motorway   companies,   and   by   the   sale   of   assets.   Therefore,   according  to  ESA  95  accounting  rules,  it  will  be   neutral  for  government  account s  in  the  short  term.   The     package     adopted     in     September,     worth      approximately   0.1%   of   GDP,   consists   mainly   of    measures  aimed  at  combating  youth  unemployment   and  helping  women  re-enter  the  job  market.  The  cost   of  the  package  will  be  borne  by  the  2005  and  2006   budgets.    The   2005   budget   will   also    be   burdened   with    additional   expenditure    on   social   transfers   as   the    number  of  unemployed  turns  out  to  be  significantly   higher than foreseen by the government.   However,  the  unexpectedly   high  tax  revenue  will   more  than  compensate  for   the  additional  expenditure.   Therefore,  the  deficit  in  2005  should  not  surpass  the   1.9% of GDP planned by the government.   2006  will  see  the  peak  of   the  revenue  loss  from   previous  tax  reforms,  estim ated  at  1.4%  of  GDP.  In   addition, the budget will have to  bear a part of the cost  of  both  the  central  government’s  job  market  package   and   those   of   regional   authorities.   Therefore,   the    deficit in 2006 is projected  at 1.8% of GDP, which is  slightly  higher  than  the   government’s  target  in  the   November 2004 update of  the stability programme.   As  the  impact  of  the  tax  reforms  wears  off  and  GDP   growth  rises,  the  deficit  ratio  sh ould  go  down  by  ½   percentage  point  in   2007,  which  is   still  considerably   higher than the stab ility programme target.   The debt ratio is expected to decrease slightly over the  forecast  period,  but  it  will  nevertheless  remain  above   the 60% of GDP reference value.   		
November/2005	Poland	Gradual recovery in the offing, but lack of fiscal reform 	Economic  activity  in  the  first   half  of  2005  did  not   fully  recover  from  the  slowd own  in  late  2004.  Real   GDP  growth  in  the  second  quarter  of  this  year  was   2.8%  year-on-year,  up  from  2.1%  in  the  first  quarter.   After a surprising drop to  1% year-on-year in the first  quarter,  investment  growth  rebounded  in  the  second   quarter  (3.8%  year-on-year).  Polish  companies  seem   to have postponed their in vestment decisions pending  the   results   of   the   parliamentary   and   presidential    elections.  Moreover,  there  appears  to  be  a  lack  of   capacity  to  absorb  EU  funds.  Domestic  demand  fell   by  0.3%  year-on-year  in  the  second  quarter  for  the   first time since the first quarter of 2002, as large-scale  de-stocking   cancelled   out   the   modest   growth   of    consumption   and   investme nt.   Overall,   economic    growth in the first half of  2005 was mainly driven by  net exports, as was the case in the past two years. Net  exports  contributed  to  GDP  growth  by  2  percentage   points,  while  the  contribution  to  growth  of  domestic   demand  almost  halved  from   the  first  quarter  to  the   second.  The  contribution  of  inventories  to  GDP  has   been  on  a  downward  trend   since  the  beginning  of   2004 and reached -2.2 percentage points in the second  quarter.  Large  de-stocking  indicates  that  enterprises   have   adjusted   their   inventory   levels   to   weaker    demand.   Short-term   indicators   do   not    show   any   sign   of    recovery,  inter  alia  reflecting  the  uncertainty  of  the   pre-election  period.  Higher  gr owth  is  expected  in  the   last   quarter   of   the   year   as   more   EU   funds   are    transferred  to  enterprises   and  political  uncertainties   dissipate.  In  2005  as  a  whole,  real  GDP  growth  is   projected  to  slow  down   to  3½%,  down  from  5.3%  in   2004.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Domestic  demand  is  expected  to  take  over  from  net   exports  as  the  main  driving  force  of  GDP  growth  in   2006    and    2007.    Both    investment    and    private     consumption  growth  are  likel y  to  pick  up  over  the   projection    period.    After     the    parliamentary    and     presidential  elections  and  the  formation  of  a  new   government in the autumn, the period of political and  economic   uncertainty   will   pr obably   end,   making    companies   more   in clined   to   invest.   Furthermore,    companies  are  starting  to  face  capacity  constraints,   while  corporate  profitability  is   strong  and  interest   rates are at a record-low level. Private consumption is  expected  to  increase  as  a  result  of  the  indexation  of   pensions,  direct  paym ents  to  farmers  and  moderate   real   wage   growth.   The    administrative   difficulties    encountered  in  d ealing  with  EU  funds  have  so  far   limited Poland’s absorp tion capacity, bu t the situation  is   likely   to   improve   si gnificantly   in   the   coming    months. Therefore, in 2006 and 2007, EU funds (up to  1.2%  and  1.5%  of  GDP,  respectively)  will  boost   domestic  demand  and  increase  imports,  which  will   translate into a negative con tribution of net exports to  GDP growth, despite the good performance by Polish  exporters.   Exports started to grow again in the second quarter of  2005  after  two  quarters  of  decline,  suggesting  that  despite  the  considerable   appreciation  of  the  zloty   since  May  2004  and  the  econ omic  slowdown  in  the   EU, Polish exporters are again gaining market shares,  mainly  in  the  countries  on   its  eastern  border  (Russia   and  Ukraine).  The  current  account  deficit  is  expected   to  narrow  to  3.2%  in  2005 .  Growing  imports  in  line   with  strengthening  domestic   demand  will  lead  to  a   steady   increase   in   the   trade   and   current   account    deficits  this  year  and  next.  However,  higher  transfers   from  the  EU  will  have  a  positiv e  impact  on  both  the   current  and  capital  accounts.  In  total,  the  current   account deficit is projected to widen to 3.5% of GDP  in  2006  and  3.9%  in  2007,  and  will  thus  remain   within sustainab le bounds.   Labour market, costs and prices  Labour  market  conditions  have   been  improving  since   the  second  quarter  of   2004.  Overall,  employment   started to grow in  2004 and is expected to stay on an  upward trend over the forecast horizon, but the rate of  employment  still  remains  the  lowest  in  the  EU.  As   economic activity gains momentum again the foreseen  employment growth should  translate into a decline in  the  unemployment  rate  by   more  than  2  percentage   points over 2005-07. This decline can be also partially  explained by a falling particip ation rate, reflecting the  extension of early retirem ent rights and a rapid growth  of  the  number  of  students.   However,  unemployment   will  still  be  relatively  high,  at  16.5%  of  the  labour   force, by the end of the forec ast horizon, reflecting the  deep-seated  structural  probl ems  in  the  labour  market.   Poland’s    unemployment    has    a    large    structural     component,    and    labour    market    difficulties    are     exacerbated       by       unfavourable       demographic        developments  and  the  ongoing  restructuring  process   in  heavy  industries  and  agriculture.  Nevertheless,  the   fall   in   unemployment   since   2004   has   been   quite    significant  compared  to  recent  years,  which  bodes   well for the near future.  After a sharp increase in  2004, annual HICP inflation  decreased  to  a  record  low  of  1.4%  in  mid-2005  from   3.6%  on  average  in  2004.   The  one-off  effects  of  EU   accession on prices faded out in the first half of 2005,  but  the  unfavourable  developments  in  oil  and  energy   prices  are  expected  to  push  consumer  price  inflation   up  to  2¼%  in  2005.  A  sli ghtly  negative  output  gap,   which is not likely to close over the forecast horizon,  and low inflationary expectations are expected to keep  inflation  in  2006  and  2007  below  the  central  bank’s   medium-term target of 2.5% , despite moderate growth  of wages and unit labour costs.   Unit  labour  costs  are  projected  to  expand  by  1.7%  in   2005,   owing   to   a   drop   in   productivity   growth    combined with modest compensation growth. In 2006  and 2007, unit labour cost growth is expected to ease  to  1¼%  as  productivity   growth  recovers  somewhat   and compensation growth  remains subdued. Although  nominal wages are expected to increase in order to at  least    sustain    growth    in    real    earnings,    high     unemployment  should  exert   a  moderating  influence   on wage growth.  Public finances   Since  the  2005  spring   forecast,  the  picture  of  public   finances   has   changed   signi ficantly    in    view    of     substantial  data  revisions   following  methodological   changes.  The  most  noticeable  change  concerns  the   2004  general  government  deficit  which  was  revised   down  to  3.9%  of  GDP  from  an  earlier  estimate  of   4.8%.  This  significant  reduction  is  mainly  due  to   revisions to the method of calculation of accrued taxes  and  social  contributions  as  well  as  revisions  to  the   accounts payable.  The  general  government  deficit  is  expected  to  reach   3.6% of GDP in 2005, in  line with the target set in the  December      Convergence      Programme      (3.9%).       However,  there  remains  considerable  uncertainty  as   regards   the   implementation   of   the   2005   budget.    Higher  revenues  due  to  extr a  dividend  contributions   from   state-owned   enterprises,   together   with   lower    expenditure for debt servicing  may not be sufficient to  outweigh   the   effects   of   lower-than-expected   GDP    growth.    Also    an    inflation    rate    below    initial     expectations   and   the   non-implementation   of   an    important  part  of  the  g overnment’s  multi-annual  plan   for  fiscal  consolidation  (Hausner  plan)  are  weighing   on the deficit.   Assuming    that    the    new    government    does    not     significantly  modify  the  draft  budget,  the  general   government  deficit  is  expe cted  to  stabilise  in  2006   despite    an    expected    increase    in    revenues.    In     particular,    the    measures    recently    adopted    by     Parliament – early retirement entitlements for miners,  the   reimbursement   of   VAT   increase   for   building    materials  and  the  indexation  of  pensions  in  2006  –   will  weigh  negatively  on  the  2 006  budget.  Under  the   no-policy-change assumption, the deficit is forecast to fall  to  3.4%  of  GDP  in   2007  as  a  result  of  stronger   growth. The deficit projections for 2006 and 2007 are  significantly   higher   than    the   targets   set   in   the    December     2004     update     of     the     Convergence      Programme.  The  forecast  still  includes  the  surplus  of   the  second-pillar  pension  fu nds,  which  is  expected  to   reach  approximately  2%  of  GDP  in  2005-07,  within   the general government sector.  The  gross  debt  figure  is  projected  to  increase  only   moderately  between  2005  and  2007.  From  43.6%  of   GDP  in  2004,  the  de bt-to-GDP  ratio  will  increase  to   some 46% in 2006, be fore stabilising in 2007. 		
November/2005	Portugal	Macro-economic imbalances looming large 	Imbalances  continue  to  pe rsist  in  Portugal.  Having   recovered from recession in 2004, GDP is expected to  grow by a modest  ѿ % in 2005.  Activity  was  relatively  lively  up   to  mid-2005,  driven   by  private  consumption.  Yet  the  recent  expansion   seems  to  have  been  largely  the  result  of  purchases   carried  forward  against  the  announced  VAT  hike  in   July.  According  to  recent  indicators,  the  momentum   of  household  spending  is  now  abating.  Investment   continues   to   suffer   from   a   shrinking   construction    sector and lacklustre business prospects.   Exports are hampered by  a weak competitive position,  although  the  external  sector’s  contribution  to  GDP   growth  was  less  negative  than  in  2004,  owing  to   decelerating  imports.  Nevertheless,  the  jump  in  oil   prices   has   further   exacerbated   the   imbalance   in    Portugal’s  net  external  position,  which  is  forecast  to   climb  to  a  negative  gap  close  to  8%  of  GDP  by  the   end of 2005, with the deterior ation in the income and  capital balances also  playing a role.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Domestic  demand  is  forecast  to  slow  down  over  the   forecast period. The cooling of private consumption is  assumed  to  be  stronger  in  2006  with  a  re-assessment   of  income  expectations  by  private  households  and  a   weaker labour market outlook. Investment is expected  to    recover    in    2007    reflecting    already    more     encouraging    business    prospects    and    a    slowly     improving  construction  secto r.  In  addition,  in  2006,   both   consumption   and   investment   rates   will   be    dampened  by  a  negative  carry-over  from  the  second   half of 2005. Public consump tion will be held back by  a tightening of general government expenditure.   The  contribution  of  the  external  sector  to  growth  is   projected   to   increase.   Exports   are   expected   to    accelerate  helped  by  less  adverse  cost  developments   in  manufacturing  and  by  a  b oost  in  car  exports,  yet   foreign  market  shares  will  d ecline  further.  In  fact,   export   performance   is   hampered   by   a   relatively    subdued  demand  and  by  increased  competition  from   emerging  economies.  Sluggish  domestic  demand  is   forecast to hold import growth down.  In  all,  the  projected  dema nd  pattern  will  yield  GDP   growth below 1% in 2006 and close to 1¼% in 2007,  with the net external borrowing remaining high.  Labour market, costs and prices  Unemployment  is  projected  to  remain  on  an  upward   trend  until  2007.  Job  cuts   have  been  particularly   marked  in  manufacturing,  wh ich  should  hold  down   unit labour costs and he lp boost co mpetitiveness.  Inflation  abated  until  mid-2005 ,  but  the  July  increase   in the normal VAT rate from  19 to 21% is rekindling  inflation. However, the hike  has not been fully passed  on  to  prices.  In  2006,  the   carry-over  of  the  VAT   increase will be felt and some  excise taxes will go up,  but  the  large  negative  output  gap  should  limit  the   scope  for  price  increases.  In  2007,  the  fading  impact   of  the  VAT  hike  on  the  annual  rate  of  price  increase   and more stable import prices may pave the way for a  deceleration of inflation.  Public finances  The  2005  general   government  deficit  is  projected  to   reach almost 6% of GDP after a deficit of 3% of GDP  in 2004. This jump is largely due to the government’s  decision to no longer impl ement one-off measures.  In  2005,  both  current  revenue  and  expenditure  have   increased as a share of GDP. Tax revenues have been  growing in excess of what th e relevant tax base would  indicate, which suggests a fur ther improvement in tax  collection,  as  already  observed   in  2004.  In  addition,   the  VAT  increase  in  July  is  a dding  to  tax  revenues.   Overall, the tax burd en is expected to jump by nearly  1   percentage   point.   Strong   upward   pressure   on    expenditure  has  persisted.  Old-age  pension  spending  grows strongly with a gro wing number of retirees and  higher  per  capita  benefits.  Public  consumption  has   been  increasing  due  to  wage  increases  above  the   2003-04 average and rising health expenditure.  This  forecast  already  includes  a  sizeable  corrective   package   adopted   in   mi d-2005.   Measur es   on   the    revenue   side   comprise   the   increase   in   VAT,   tax    increases  for  petrol  and  tobacco  and  a  curb  on  tax   benefits.   Regarding   expe nditure,   efforts   are   being    targeted  at  the  reform  of   pension  schemes  and  public   administration,  including  career  and  wages  scales.  In   the meantime, there will be a freeze on promotions in  the public sector until  the end of 2006 1 . A marked improvement of the government balance is  projected   on   account   of   the   corrective   measures.    However,  there  are  some  risks  that  may  bound  its   success.  First,  economic  conditions  may  be  adverse   with    subdued    domestic    demand    jeopardizing    a     stronger  expansion  of  tax  revenues.  Second,  some   expenditure-curbing   measures   may   yield   limited    short-term  savings.  Additionally,  interest  expenditure   will increase with rising debt and interest rates.   In  2006,  the  general   government  deficit  is  forecast  at   close  to  5%  of  GDP.  Based  on  the  no-policy-change   assumption,  the  deficit  will  marginally  improve  in   2007.  The  trend  in  the  pri mary  deficit  should  be   somewhat better. On the back of high deficits and low  GDP  growth,  the  government  debt  ratio  will  remain   on an upward path. 		
November/2005	Slovenia	Exports supporting economic growth 	In  2004,  economic  growt h  was  lower  than  initially   estimated; real GDP grew by 4.2% (instead of 4.6%) 1 . The  stimulus  was  mainly   internal.  The  considerable   build-up    of    inventories    took    place    before    EU     accession as imports surged in anticipation of changes  in  trade  regimes  with  some   countries  of  the  former   Yugoslavia.  At  the  same  tim e,  exports  rallied,  which   helped  to  narrow  the  negative  contribution  of  foreign   demand to GDP growth.   Despite  the  bleak  circumstan ces  in  the  international   environment   this   year,   GDP   growth   is   likely   to    decelerate  only  slightly,  to  3.8%.  After  relatively   weak   activity   in   the   first    quarter,   the   economy    boomed in the second quarter. It seems, however, that  this  was  mainly  due  to  (temporary)  effects  in  foreign   trade  linked  to  the  subs tantial  increase  in  exports  of   cars  to  France  and  Austria.  Contrary  to  expectations,   export  performance  was  not  seriously  affected  by  the   slowdown  in  the  main   European  trading   partners  and   remained  remarkably  resilient  in  the  face  of  oil  price   increases.  High  commodity  price   levels,  on  the  other   hand, impinged on imports, and producers reacted by  limiting their investment  activity. As also de-stocking  occurred     capital     formation     plunged     whereas      household consumption strengthened with a sustained  rise  in  employment,  a  marked  increase  of  real  wages   and  advantageous  borrowing   conditions  (as  of  2004,   domestic  banks  are  also  allowed  to  offer  loans  in   foreign   currency   to   i ndividuals).   This   year,   the    economy  will  continue  to  be  driven  by  domestic   demand while the external  contribution  turns positive.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007   In  2006,  real  GDP  growth  is  forecast  to  accelerate  to   4%. Investment expenditure is  expected to pick up as  production processes are adjust ed in order to improve  the    competitiveness    of    Slovene    industry,    and     investment  spending  related  to  construction  activity   should  also  stay  high,  as  evidenced  by  strong  growth   in  the  number  of  constru ction  permits  issued.  Private   spending,  particularly  the  purchase  of  durable  goods,   is likely to remain buoyant. Domestic demand should  fuel   the   economy   while   foreign   demand   is   also    expected   to   contribute    positively   to   GDP   growth    against  the  projections  of  healthy  export  growth  to   continue.   With export markets recovering as oil prices decrease,  and  expectations  linked  to  the  adoption  of  the  euro   that   spur   domestic   consumption,   GDP   growth   is    projected  to  accelerate  further  to  4.2%  in  2007.  As   imports  are  set  to  rise  stead ily  in  step  with  strong   private and investment spending, the negative current  account  is  likely  to  deteriorate  further.  According  to   the   revised   balance-of-payments   statistics,   which    revealed  a  much  bigger  deficit  for  2004,  the  current   account is expected to linger around -2% of GDP.  Labour market, costs and prices    In  2005,  the  situation  on  the  labour  market  improved   with a marked rise in employment and a sustained fall  in   unemployment,   togethe r   with   a   considerable    increase  of  gross  wages  compared  to  the  year  before.   Admittedly,   this   is   estima ted   to   result   from   the    methodological  adjustment   in  the  calculation  of  the   average    wage    to    include    enterprises    with    1-2     employees.  Furthermore,  it  also  reflects  the  effect  of   the new tax regime, which ended favourable treatment  for  freelance  fees  and  thus  encouraged  employers  to   pay  salaries  instead.  Wage  increases  in  2005  are,   therefore,   likely   to   depart   from   the   arrangement    whereby  wage  rise  should  lag  behind  productivity   growth  by  more  than  one  percentage  point.  Although   the wage negotiations for 2006-2007 are still ongoing,  the  immediate  outlook  for  the  labour  market  remains   relatively   positive   as   the   unemployment   rate   is    projected  to  drop  below  6%,   in  step  with   the  robust   GDP growth.  In   2005,   against   the   ba ckground   of   oil   price    fluctuations,   consumer   price    inflation   has   become    volatile   but   continued    to   decline   on   average.   In   October,  the  12-month  moving  average  inflation  rate   stood at 2.7%. Regular adjust ments of excise duties to  temper the adverse effects of high  oil prices helped in  keeping the disinflation path smooth. Furthermore, the  government  has  regulated  ad ministered  price  rises  in   such  a  way  as  not  to   exert  inflationary  pressures,   while market prices have clearly been driven down by  increased competition following EU entry. Moreover,  inflation  has  been  falling  again st  the  stab le  exchange   rate ever since Slovenia joined ERM II.   Assuming the continuation of policy measures geared  toward  further  disinflation,  consumer  prices  will  rise   only  slowly.  The  commitment   to  adopt  the  euro  in   January   2007   restricts   the   au thorities’   room   for    manoeuvre   in   setting   prices   while   oil   prices   are    considered a risk factor.  Public finances  After  revision  of  the  general   government  deficits  for   2000-2004  to  include  the  two  extra-budgetary  funds,   further  alignment  with  th e  Eurostat  rules  has  caused   an  additional  substantial  up ward  revision  of  the  2001   and   2003   deficit.   In   2005,    however,  the   general    government deficit is set to decline to 1.7% of GDP as  the  shortfall  of  the  new  direct  tax  regime  will  be   smaller    than    expected.     Given    the    uncertainties     surrounding   the   future   amendments   to   the   tax    legislation, the forecast for 2006 projects the deficit to  increase  again  against  the  decision  to  index  pensions   to wages and the commitment of the new government  to gradually abolish the payroll tax. 		
November/2005	Slovakia	Domestic demand continues to drive growth 	Thus  far,  the  available  data  suggest  that  economic   growth  in  2005  remains   strong  at  slightly  above  5%   and  continues  to  be  driven  by  domestic  demand,   particularly by investment  and private consumption.  Robust   employment    and   real   wage   growth   are    expected to lift private consumption growth above 5%  in 2005. Gross fix ed capital formation is estimated to  grow by more than 8% supported by the realisation of  some big investment projects as well as by an increase  in  public  infrastructure  i nvestment.  The  contribution   of  net  exports  should  remain  in  negative  territory   against the backdrop of lower  growth of both exports  and   imports   which   can    be   partly   attributed   to    interruptions in production caused by switches to new  product lines in the  car manufacturing industry.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  The  economic  expansion  is  anticipated  to  accelerate   to  around  5½%  in  2006  and  to  above  6%  in  2007.   Domestic demand is likely to remain the driving force  while  export  growth  should  speed  up  in  2006  as  new   export capacity will gradually come on stream and the  external   contribution   should   thus   become   positive    again. Strong   household   credit    growth   is   also   likely   to    continue   to   support   private   consumption   growth    which  should  remain  above  4%  over  the  forecast   horizon.  Gross  fixed  capital   formation  is  predicted  to   further  accelerate  in  2006  as  already  pledged  green- field  investments  are  realised   while  the  government,   supported  by  EU  funds,  co ntinues  to  invest  in  large   infrastructure  projects.  The  investment  boom  should   then  decelerate  in  2007,  under  the  assumption  of  no   new    major    foreign    direct    investments.    As    the     increases  of  exports  induced  by  the  new  production   capacities  are  initially  accompanied  by  imports  of   investment  goods  fo r  these  facilities,  the  external   contribution  will  probab ly  not  increase  significantly   until 2007.  The  current  account  deficit  is  expected  to  widen   further  to  above  6%  of  GDP  in  2005  as  sharply   increasing repatriated profits add to the negative trade  balance.   Accelerating   exports   should   lead   to   a    measured improvement in the current account balance  in 2006 and 2007.    Labour market, costs and prices  In   the   second   quarter   of   2005   total   employment    (labour  force  sample  survey)  increased  by  more  than   2% (y-o-y) and it has now b een growing for a year. A  similarly   positive   trend    is   expected   to   continue    throughout  the  whole  year  leading  to  employment   growth    for    2005    at    around    1¾%    while    the     unemployment  rate  should  decrease  to  below  17%.   Similar,  though  slower,  trends   are  also  anticipated  in   2006 and 2007.    Although  the  yea r-on-year  consumer  price  inflation   rate  fell  to  2%  in  August  2 005  and  averaged  2½%   over  the  first  8  months  of  2005,  the  adjustments  in   administered prices and indirect taxes are estimated to  drive  it  up  to  about  4%  towards  the  end  of  the  year.   As these one-off effects fade out, inflation should fall  back to 2% in 2007 if  the second-round  effects and, in  particular, nominal wage growth are kept in check.  Public finances  After  the  tax  reforms  were  put  in  place  in  2004,  a   pension  reform  was  launched  in  2005.  This  reform   affects social contributions by  redirecting 9 percent of  gross  wages  to  a  funded  (second) pension pillar. Due  to  a  large  public  interest,  rev enue  transfers  to  the   second  pension  pillar  are  an ticipated  at  about  ¾%,   1¼%  and  1½%  of  GDP  in  2005,  2006  and  2007   respectively. From  autumn  2005  until   the  end  of  the  transition   period   granted   by   Eurostat   in   spring   2007,   the    Commission   services’   forecasts    will   present   the    general  government  deficit  net  of  the  pension  reform  cost, that is, the second pillar  pension scheme will be  classified as government.   The  general  government  deficit  for  2005,  net  of  the   pension  reform  cost  and  ne t  of  the  cancellation  of   some  developing  countries’  debt  amounting  to  about   0.8%  of  GDP,  is  anticipated  at  around  3¼%  of  GDP   which  is  slightly  lower  than   foreseen  in  the  2005   budget.   This   positive   deve lopment   is,   however,    mainly  driven  by  a  lo wer-than-expected  interest  cost   of  public  debt.  The  prim ary  deficit  is  estimated  to  be   larger than originally planned  as some of the financial  resources  that  were  freed  are  being  used  to  cover   other unplanned pub lic expenditures.   The  general  government  deficit  net  of  the  pension   reform cost is for 2006 estimated at some 3% of GDP.  Increases in public expenditure in the election year are  anticipated   to   largely   offset   a   favourable   growth    performance  as  well  as  the   positive  trend  in  the   servicing  costs  of  public  debt  preventing  a  more   significant  fi scal  consolidation.  In  order  to  ensure   sufficient  public  revenues   the  government  adopted  a   number  of  measures,  the  most  significant  being  the   restriction  of  child  tax  allowances  and  increases  in   taxes  on  cigarettes  and  alcohol  as  well  as  in  some   administration fees.  Under the customary no policy change assumption the  budget  deficit  net  of  the  pension  reform  cost  will  in   2007  fall  to  about   2½%  of  GDP  as  a  result  of   accelerating growth.  Gross  public  debt  is  estimate d  to  decrease  sharply  to   around  36¾%  of  GDP  in  2005  as  a  part  of  the   privatisation  revenues  from  previous  years  has  been   used  to  pay-off  some  of  th e  country’s  de bts.  In  2006   and  2007,  government  de bt  is  projected  to  slightly   increase but should remain below 40% of GDP. 		
November/2005	Finland	Growth to rebound from temporary reversal 	Following  a  rate  of  3.6%   in  2004,  real  GDP  growth   slowed  down  to  about  1%  year-on-year  in  the  first   half  of  2005.  Output  edged  down  in  the  first  quarter   by 0.1% from the previous pe riod, owing mainly to a  decline  in  gross  fixed  capital  formation  and  sluggish   industrial  production.  In   the  second  quarter,  GDP   contracted   by   a   further   1.6%   from   the   previous    quarter   as   the   seven-week-long   paper   and   pulp    industry  lockout  that  ended   in  late  June  weighed   heavily on growth.  The lo ckout is estimated to shave  roughly 1 percentage point  off GDP growth for 2005.  This  includes  the  direct  and  indirect  effects  on  other   parts  of  the  economy,  e.g.   transport,  forest ry  logging   and the chemical industry.  Domestic demand was the driver of growth in the first  part  of  2005,  while  the   contribution  from  net  exports   was    more    subdued    than    expected.    Household     consumption  was  fuelled  by   higher  earnings,  a  pick- up in employment and low  interest rates.  The upward  trend  in  total  investment   since  summer  2003  was   reversed  in  the  first  part  of  2005,  with  investment   down    by    around    2%    from    2004.    Residential     construction  edged  down  slightly,  while  equipment   and  machinery  investment  shrank  markedly,  by  over   8%. In the first half of  2005, exports we re surprisingly  strong   despite   the   pa per   industry   labour   conflict.    However,  part  of  the  foreig n  trade  was  in  transit   exports, such as automobiles and telecommunications  products,   which   were   import ed   to   Finland,   then    exported   mainly   to   Russi a.   Consequently,   import    growth  was  robust  in  the  first  part  of  2005.  The   weakening  in  the  terms  of  trade  continued  as  export   prices  fell  somewhat,  while  import  prices  increased   further.    Prospects for 2006 and 2007   The economy is projected to return to and remain on a  firm   growth   path   throughout   the   forecast   period.    Survey indicators suggest that  activity will pick up in  the  latter  part  of  2005,   as  industrial  production  and   exports   are   strengthening   wh ile   domestic   demand    remains  solid.  The  paper  indust ry  labour  dispute  is   deemed to have had only short-term temporary effects  on  the  economy.  Therefore,  real  GDP  growth  should   rebound  to  close  to  3½%  in   2006,  partly  boosted  by   the  base  effect,  and  then  abate  to  its  potential  growth   rate of 2½%-3% in 2007.   Private  consumption  is  expected  to  continue  to  give   firm  support  to  activity,   underpinned  by  income  tax   cuts  and  healthy  job  creation.   Public  consumption  is   foreseen to increase modestly,  given the efforts of the  central government to cont rol expenditure. Investment  is  projected  to  bounce  back  after  a  surprisingly  weak   performance  in  2005  and  provide  a  solid  stimulus  to   growth in 2006-2007. Net ex ports should increasingly  contribute   to   growth.   Exports   are   anticipated   to    rebound  and  gain  further  momentum  due  to  strong   import  demand  from  Russia.  The  electronics  industry   has   remained   competitive   and   the   prospects   for    exports   of   telecommunications   equipment   appear    rather  promising.  Imports  ar e  expected  to  grow  at  a   firm pace on the back of lively domestic demand.   Labour market, costs and prices  Despite  the  slowdown  of  activity,  employment  has   increased further this year, by over 1¼% year-on-year  up to September. As labour supply has expanded less  than employment, the unem ployment rate fell to 8.3%  in September.   Recently,  higher  energy  prices  have  exerted  upward   pressures    on    HICP    inflation,    while    tightening     competition        in        services,        especially        in         telecommunications,   has   kept   price   increases   in    check.         During   the   forecast   period,   inflation   is    expected to stay at around 1½%.   The  centralised  wage  agreemen t,  settled  in  late  2004,   provides    for    moderate    wage    increases    up    to     September  2007.  Assuming  the  usual  positive  wage   drift of about 1 percentage  point, per capita wages are  expected  to  increase  on  average  by  3.0%  in  2006-2007. However, higher grow th in productivity appears  likely  to  limit  the  rise  in   unit  labour  costs  to  around   1% over the forecast period.   Public finances   On   the   basis   of   the   government’s   medium-term    spending  guidelines  of  spring  2005  and  the  budget   proposal  for  2006,  the  genera l  government  surplus  is   projected  to  fall  slightly  from  over  2%  of  GDP  in   2004   to   1¾%   by   2007.   The   general   government    surplus   will   rest   solely   on    the   surplus   of   social    security. Central government finances are expected to  be  roughly  in  balance  in  2005   and  then  slip  into   deficit  since  the  government  has  supplemented  the   collective  wage  agreement  by  sizeable  income  tax   cuts of about 1% of GDP.  Local government finances  will    stay    in    deficit    due    to    higher    operating     expenditure, even with tax revenues projected to rise.   The  government  debt  ratio  is  projected  to  steadily   decline  to  below  41%  of  GDP  by  the  end  of  the   forecast period. 		
November/2005	Sweden	Continued recovery after blip	The  slowdown  in  growth  that  took  place  towards  the   end  of  2004  continued  in  the  first  quarter  of  2005.   This    slowdown    affected    exports    and    domestic     consumption     in     particular      while     investments      continued   to   expand   strongly.   However,   national    account  figures  for  the  second  quarter  indicate  a   recovery, mainly led by  stronger private  consumption  and  a  recovery  in  exports.  Overall,  GDP  growth  was   up around 2% on the year  in the first half of 2005.   Recent  indicators  are  generally  positive.  Consumer   confidence  has  continued  to  show  an  increasingly   positive  picture  both  as  reg ards  household  views  on   the  economy  as  a  whole  and  on  their  own  economic   situation.  Industrial  confidence  has,  however,  fallen   back somewhat to around its long-term average while  there is more optimism in  services, retail trade and in  particular construction.    These  prospects  are  expected  to  be  confirmed  in  a   steady  continuation  of  th e  recovery  in  the  remainder   of  2005,  with  GDP  grow th  of  around  2½%  led  by   domestic demand.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  In  2006,  economic  growth  is  expected  to  be  around   3%  with  domestic  demand  driving  growth  while  in   2007 the economy is expected to grow somewhat less  but close to the potential growth rate   A  resumption  of  employment  growth  will  contribute   positively  to  household  disposable  income  in  2006   and 2007, enabling continued st eady growth in private  consumption.  While  households  have  taken  on  more   debt, financial wealth has bene fited from rising equity  and house prices, contributing to the maintenance of a  relatively  strong  wealth  po sition.  A  modest  reduction   of the saving rate is expected over the forecast period.  Public consumptio n is expected to increase, reflecting  more    stable    local    gove rnment    finances    and    a     relatively   expansionary    2006   central   government    budget.  In  investme nt,  the  conditions   for  a  continued   expansion,  albeit  at  a  decelerating  pace,  remain  in   place: a benign demand outlook, favourable financing  conditions   and   a   high   capacity   utilisation   rate   in    manufacturing. A high rate of  investment is therefore  expected   over   the   forecast   period.   Exports   are    expected  to  continue  to  grow   relatively  strongly  both   in 2006 and 2007, in  line with world markets. Imports  should  also  grow  faster  as  fi nal  demand  strengthens.   Overall,  net  exports  will  only  make  a  substantial   contribution to growth  again in 2007.   Labour market, costs and prices  Employment  growth,  after  having  been  negative  in   2004, is expected to turn po sitive in 2005 and remain  so  over  the  forecast  period.  The  relatively  strong  rise   in  economic  activity  foreseen   over  the  2005-2007   period  is  expected  to  result  in   an  improvement  in  the   labour   market   given   that   the   very   high   labour    productivity  growth  seen  over  the  last  few  years  will   moderate. Against this background and supported by a  significant  increase  in  the  volume  of  active  labour   market measures in 2006,  the unemployment rate will  decrease  over  the  period.  It  should  be  noted  that  a   methodological    change    in    the    measurement    of     unemployment  increases  the  le vel  by  around  0.4%- points from 2005 as compared to 2004 and earlier.   Inflation has continued to  fall considerably,  in spite of  the  significant  recent  rises  in  oil  prices.  The  subdued   outlook  for  inflation  has  en abled  the  Riksbank  to   continue  reducing  interest  rate s,  with  a  further  cut  in   the repo rate of 50 basis points in June 2005.  The   relatively   weak   developm ents   in   the   labour    market  have  helped  to  contain  wage  demands  and   wages  are  expected  to  continue  to  rise  relatively   moderately, reflecting the current wage agreement for  private  sector  and  central  government,  reached  in  the   spring of 2004 and covering  a period including 2006.  Recent    wage    agreements    for    local    government     employees  have  resulted  in  slightly  lower  negotiated  wage  rises  than  in  the  previous  agreement.  Against   this background, inflationary pressures continue to be  subdued.  As  demand  and  growth  revive  further  in   2006  and  2007,   inflation  is  expected   to  rise  towards   2% during the  course of 2007.   Public finances  In  2005,  the  surp lus  in  public  finan ces  is  expected  to   be  around  1½%  of  GDP,   similar  to  2004.  In  both   years,  the  budget  has  benefited  from  large  one-off   corporate   tax   receipts   amounting   roughly   to   a    cumulative 1% of GDP.    Sweden  will  continue  to   show  budget  surpluses  over   the  forecast  period.  Income  tax  cuts  proposed  in  the   2006 Budget Bill, th e last step of a phased income tax  reform, as well as additional labour market measures,  will contribute to an e xpansionary fiscal policy stance  that  will  reduce  the  surplus   ratio  in  the  government   finances  in  2006  as  compared  to  2005.  On  current   policies, a slight rise in the bu dget surplus is projected  in  2007,  as  a  result  also  of   an  improvement  in  the   labour   market.   It   should    be   noted   that   Swedish    government   accounts   will   include   second   pillar    pension  funds  (contributing  to  improve  the  budget   balance  by  about  1%  of  GDP  per  year)  until  spring   2007.   General   government   gross   debt,   mainly   central    government  liabilities,  is  pr ojected  to  rise  as  central   government  is  expected  to  remain  in  deficit  over  the   forecast  period.  The  increase  is  nevertheless  slower   than  nominal  GDP  over  the  forecast  period,  resulting   in  a  fall  in  the  debt  ratio   to  close  to  48%  of  GDP  in   2007. 		
November/2005	United Kingdom	Catching its breath 	UK  GDP  growth  has  slowed  markedly  since  the   second half of 2004 and into 2005.  Growth was 1.5%  year-on-year  in  th e  second  quarter  of  2005,  down   from  1.7%  in  the  first  quart er.    By  comparison,  year- on-year  growth  in  the  sec ond  quarter  of  2004  was   3.7%. The slowdown in the first half of 2005 has been  reflected by lower growth in the service sector than in  previous    quarters,    while    manufacturing    output     actually shrank over the period.   For 2005 as a whole, GDP gr owth is now projected at  just above 1½%, compared to 3.2% in 2004. Faltering  domestic  demand  is  chiefly  responsible  for  the  sharp   slowdown,  in  the  second  quarter  of  2005  growing  by   only  1.3%  over  the  previous  year,  down  from  3.7%   for   the   whole   of   2004.   Household   consumption    appears  to  have  been  hit  by   a  cooler  housing  market   and  the  impact  of  higher  interest  rates  on  highly- leveraged  household  balance  sheets,  and  is  expected   to remain subdued for the rest of the year.   Total  investment  has  also  slowed  compared  to  2004.   Although  government  investment  has  grown  rapidly,   in  line  with  budgetary  plans,  business  investment  has   not    responded    to    favou rable    conditions    (high     profitability,   robust   equity    markets   and   low   real    interest  rates).    Investment  is   expected  to  remain   subdued throughout 2005.  Net  trade  evolved  erratically  in   the  first  two  quarters   of  2005.  Overall,  however,  data  for  the  first  half  of   2005  show  slower  growth  of  imports  compared  to   exports,  consistent  with  the  observed  slowdown  in   domestic demand. For the year as a whole, net trade is  expected to be neutral in terms of contribution to GDP  growth, after the large negativ e contribution in 2004.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  pick  up  over  the  forecast   period,  rising  to  just   above  2¼%  in  20 06  and  around   2¾%  in  2007,  mainly  th anks  to  expanding  domestic   demand      driven      principally      by      government       consumption, investment and to a lesser extent private  consumption.     Household consumption is ex pected to start to pick up  a  little  in  2006,  and  th en  settle  at  a  moderate  but   significant   rate   of   growth    by   2007.   The   private    consumption pick-up is support ed by a labour market  expected   to   remain   relatively   firm.   A   projected    increase in the saving rate from  the very low levels in  2004 points to some balance sheet consolidation in the  household sector.   Business   investment    is   restrained   by   uncertainties    over      the      overall      macroeconomic      outlook,       compounded    by    high    oil    prices.    Against    that     background,  business  will  prob ably  hold  back  on   expanding  capacity  in  the  short  term.    Nonetheless,   business  investment  is  expected   to  pick  up  in  2006   and   2007,   eventually   reacting   to   the   favourable    conditions and high levels of profitability projected to  continue throughout the forecast period.  Growth in government consumption and investment is  expected  to  play  an  impor tant  role  in  supporting   domestic  demand  during  the  economic  slowdown.  Government   gross   fixed   capital   formation   should    grow  strongly  in  2005   and  2006,  con sistent  with   government  plans  to  increase  investment  in  public   services. Beyond that, gover nment investment growth  is planned to slow sign ificantly in 2007.   On  the  external  side,  the  estimates  project  a  smaller   decline  of  the  UK’s  share  of  world  trade  than  in  the   recent  past.  Net  trade  contributes  positively  albeit   modestly to growth.   In  sum,  the  forecast  shows  the  economy  becoming   slightly    more    balanced,    with    domestic    demand     playing a lesser role in drivi ng growth and net exports  becoming slightly positive for growth.   Labour market, costs and prices  Higher    oil    prices    have    heightened    inflationary     pressures   through   higher   fuel   pump   prices   and    through  the  indirect  effect  on  the  cost  of  producing   goods and services that use oil as an input.  Moreover,  demand  pressure  on  capacity  is  feeding  through  to   prices,  including  demand  pressure  in  the  rest  of  the   world which has helped push up import prices.   Persistently  high  oil  prices  are   expected  to  result  in   HICP 1    inflation   in   2005   exceeding   the   Bank   of    England’s  2%  target.  However,  given  the  credibility   of   the   monetary   policy   framework,   inflationary    expectations  are  expected  to   remain  anchored  around   the  target  and  HICP  inflation  to   decline  towards  the   2% mark over the forecast period.  The  labour  market  continues   to  perform  well.    The   unemployment  rate  remains  around  a  historical  low,   yet  with  earnings  growth  st able.  Temporarily  higher   inflation  is  not  expected  to   feed  through   into  higher   earnings   growth,   which   is   projected   to   remain    consistent  with  achievemen t  over  time  of  the  official   inflation  target.  Moderate  wage  growth  matches  a   slight  weakening  of  the  labour  markets  in  2006,  in   line with the slowdown of the economy.   Employment growth is expected to moderate, partly in  response  to  lower  growth   and  partly  because  of  the   already  high  UK  employment   rates.    As  the  lagged   impact  of  slower  growth  is  felt  in  the  labour  market,   unemployment  is  projected   to  rise  slightly  in  2006,   1  Referred to in the UK as the CPI.  only  to  decrease  in  the  last  year  of  the  forecast  as   growth picks up.   Public finances  According  to  data  released  in  August,  the  general   government   deficit   reached   3.2%   of   GDP   in   the    2004/05   financial   year 2    (running   from   April   to    March).    Given    the    mo re    subdued    short-term     prospects,  the  deficit  is  expected  to  widen  to  just   below  3½%  of  GDP  in  2005/06.  The  table  below   details  the  projections  for  gene ral  government  deficit   and debt on a fi nancial year basis.  Growth of revenues from i ndirect taxes is subdued in  2005,  reflecting  the  drop  in  output  and  consumption.   This  is  partly  offset  by  the  positive  impact  of  higher   oil   prices   on   offshore   corporation   tax   revenues.    Recent  changes  to  the  timing  of  offshore  corporation   tax  receipts  mean  that  most  of  the  favourable  impact   is  expected  to  accrue  in  the  last  two  quarters  of   2005/06.  This  should  boost  overall  corporation  tax   receipts,  which  were  already  buoyant  in  the  first  half   of 2005.   The     projections     assume     primary     non-cyclical      expenditure in line with government plans throughout  the forecast period, although outturn data for the first  two  quarters  of  2005/06  po int  to  the  potential  for   under-spending   this   fina ncial   year,   and   thus   the    possibility of a lower deficit than the central forecast.   The  budget  deficit  is  projected  to  remain  over  3%  of   GDP in 2006/07.  Nevertheless, the projected trend is  expected  to  be  a  gradual  improvement  to  around  3%   of GDP in 2007/08.     The gradual improvement of the budget deficit hinges  on three factors.  First,  a  cyclical  improvement  from  the  pick-up  of   growth    over    2006    and    2007.    The    continued     profitability of UK companies throughout the forecast  period  is  also  expected  to  sustain  the  corporation  tax   base,  depressed  in  the  recent  past  by  losses  carried   forward from previous years;   Second,     the     projections     include     a     structural      improvement  in  the  ratio  between  direct  tax  receipts   and  their  respective  tax  bases   in  line  with  long  term   trends;  Third,   reflecting   the   government’s   plans,   overall    expenditure  growth  is  projected  to  moderate  slightly   in the 2007/08  financial year.    General   government   gross   debt   is   projected   to    increase from just below 41%% of GDP in 2004/05 to  around 44 ½ % of GDP in 2007/08. 		
April/2006	Belgium	A strong start after a weak 2005 	In 2005, economic activity gradually accelerated after  a  near  standstill  in  the  first   quarter,  resulting  in  a   moderate   1.2%   growth   of   real   GDP.   Investment    growth  turned  out  to  be  very   high,  mainly  as  a  result   of  a  catching-up  effect  after  several  years  of  low   investment  and  some  exceptional   investments  in  the   shipping industry (amounting to  about 0.2% of GDP).  Public  investment,  mainly   by  local  government,  also   experienced  exceptiona lly  strong  growth  (13.5%  in   real  terms)  in  the  run-up  to   the  October  2006  local   elections.  Meanwhile,  other  components  of  domestic   demand  grew  more  moderately  due  to  continuously   decreasing  consumer  confidence  in  the  first  three   quarters of the year and strict expenditure restraint by  the  government  in  view   of  its  budgetary  targets.  Net   exports  deteriorated  significan tly  as  a  result  of  a   decrease  in  external  demand  in  the  first  quarter  of   2005  combined  with  a  strong  acceleration  of  imports   in the final three quarters.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  By now the acceleration of activity that had started in  2005  has  gained  momentum  and  should  lead  to  real   GDP  growth  of  around  2.3%  in  2006  and  of  2.1%  in   2007.  The  Belgian  central  bank's  business  survey,   which  is  usually  a  very  goo d  indicator  for  cyclical   developments  (see  graph  3.1),  has  shown  a  marked   improvement    since    the     second    half    of    2005.     Moreover,  consumer  confidence  has  also  started  to   improve  since  its  low  poin t  in  the  third  quarter  last   year,   with   households   re porting   a   higher   saving    capacity    and    lower    unemployment    expectations.     Consumer  demand  also  benefits  from  an  anticipated   increase  in  real  disposable  income,  due  to  increased   employment and the implement ation of the final stage  of  the  2001  tax  reform .  Meanwhile  str ong  business   confidence,   growing   demand   and   continued   high    business   profitability   are   supporting   high   private    investment  levels  in  2006,  although  the  growth  rate   should  fall  back  somewh at  following  the  exceptional   results in 2005. The electoral public investment cycle  that  started  in  2005   should  also  remain  strong  in  the   first  half  of  2006.  But  it  is  expected  to  decrease   markedly after the local elections , following a similar  pattern  observed  in  the  pa st.  Moreover,  its  impact  is   offset by large real estate sales (0.2% of GDP) by the  federal      government      in      2006.      Government       consumption should remain more subdued throughout  the  forecasting  period  in  view  the  strict  budgetary   targets. The significant loss in  net exports near the end  of  2005  is  expected  to  be  mainly  temporary  and   external  demand  should  increase  as  a  result  of  the   growth    acceleration    in    Belgium's    main    trading     partners.   Labour market, costs and prices  The  labour  market  is  expected   to  benefit  from  the   economic upturn that started toward s the end of 2005.  Total  employment  is  forecast  to  grow  by  about  1%   per  annum  in  2006  and   2007,  but  the  impact  on   unemployment  is  partly  offset  by  the  growth  of  the   labour  force.  Despite  efforts   to  restrain  labour  costs,   pressures  on  competitiveness  are   building  up  due  to   wage moderation in th e neighbouring countries.  In  2006,  HICP  inflation   might  still  suffer  from  the   recent turmoil in oil markets and reach 2.4%. Inflation  measured  by  the  national  CPI  in  2006  (2.0%)  will   exceptionally  be  lower  th an  HICP  inflation,  due  to  a   revision  of  the  product  basket  and  a  change  in  the   base   year.   From   2007   onwards,   HICP   and   CPI    inflation are expected to be about the same, at around  2.1%.   Public finances  Despite    the    growth    deceleration,    tax    revenue     remained  on  track  in  200 5.  Reforms  in  the  health   sector   kept   health   care   expenditure   in   line   with    expectations   (against   a   large   overrun   in   2004).    Government  accounts  also  benefited  from  additional   one-off  revenues  of  some  0.2%  of  GDP  linked  to  a   decision  to  take  over  pension   obligations  from  the  SNCB  (railways)  and  the  Antwerp  Port.  As  a  result,   Belgium has reported a small surplus 1  for 2005.   For  2006,  a  deficit  of  0.3%  of  GDP  can  be  expected,   in  contrast  to  the  balanc ed  budget  foreseen  in  the   2006 budget law, mainly as  a result of lower estimates  for  the  proceeds  of  some  new  taxes  (for  instance  on   some investment products or on excess capacity in the  electricity   industry)   in    the   2006   budget   and   less    optimistic      assumptions      regarding      government       expenditure.    A    substan tial    package    of    one-off     measures  (0.6%  of  GDP)  also  supports  government   accounts.  In  the  first  months  of  2006,  tax  revenue   continued  to  increase  stron gly,  but  this  was  largely   offset   by   an   unanticipated    increase   in   interest    expenditure  following   recent  interest  rate  rises.  In   2007  the  government  ba lance  is  likely  to  further   deteriorate  due  to  the  phas ing  out  of  the  above- mentioned  one-off  measures  and  measures  to  reduce   the  tax-burden  on  labour  (0 .2%),  though  this  will  be   partly offset by anticipated reduc tions in spending by  local  authorities  (0.2%).  Therefo re,  on  a  no-policy- change basis a deficit of 0.9% of GDP is anticipated.   The  debt  reduction  was  slow ed  down  in  2005  by  the   assumption  of  debt  from  the  railways,  but  should   continue in 2006 and 2007. By the end of the forecast  horizon,  the  debt  ratio  is   expected  to  fall  well  below   90% of GDP. 		
April/2006	czech Republic	Strong GDP growth increasingly fuelled by domestic demand 	Real  GDP  growth  reached  6%  in  2005,  the  best  ever   result  in  the  15  years  history  of  the  Czech  Republic.   This  impressive  economic  performance  was  driven   mainly by very strong net  exports, coming largely on  the  back  of  foreign  direct   investment  of  previous   years  in  the  automotive  sector.  Exports  rose  by  more   than 11% in real terms, while imports were up by just  under 5%. The external bal ance of goods and services  improved  significantly  in  2 005,  reaching  a   surplus  of   about  2%  of  GDP,  for  the  first  time  since  1991.   Against this backdrop, the  net borrowing vis-à-vis the  rest  of  the  world  narrowed  substantially.  Growth  of   private  consumption  remaine d  weak,  in  line  with  the   moderate  growth  of  real  gross  disposable  income,   which  was  negatively  influ enced  by  relatively  weak   real  wage  growth  and  unfavourable  developments  in   the  terms  of  trade.  Public  consumption  grew  only   slightly,  though  data  are  affected   by  a  large  one-off   purchase  of  military  equipment.  Gross  fixed  capital   formation  decelerated,  d espite  the  record-low  interest   rates.  From  the  supply  side,   economic  activity  was   driven   mainly   by   industry,   trade   and   financial    services.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  In   2006   and   2007,   the   economic   expansion   is    projected  to  remain  strong,  but  to  decelerate  to  some   5¼% in 2006 and 4¾% in 2007 . Domestic demand is  expected  to  replace  net  exports  as  the  main  growth   driver.  Private  consumption  will  be  stimulated  by  an   improving  labour  market   situation,  while  investment   will  benefit  from  new  projects  by  foreign  investors,   higher    utilisation    of    EU    structural    funds    and     favourable  financial  conditions.  Public  consumption   will accelerate as well, though only modestly.  Vigorous  exports  are  likely   to  continue,   profiting   mainly  from  favourable  econom ic  developments  in   the   main   trading   partners   and   thanks   to   new    production   capacities   in   the    automotive   industry.    Imports   are   projected   to   accelerate   against   the    backdrop   of   stronger   investment   and   a   moderate    increase   in   consumer   spending.   The   favourable    developments  in  net  exports  will  be  largely  offset  by   increasing deficits in the in come balance due to rising  repatriated   profits   and   sal aries   to   non-residents.    Nevertheless,  the  net  borro wing  vis-à-vis  the  rest  of   the world should hover on ly around 2% of GDP.   Labour market, costs and prices  Strong  economic  performance  helped  improve  the   situation  in  the  labour  market.    Employment  grew   faster in 2005 and the rate of unemployment began to  fall,  reaching  less  than  8%.  Employment  is  projected   to  continue  rising  over  the  forecast  horizon.  The   unemployment rate is forecast to fall from almost 8%  in  2005  to  about  7½%  in   2007.  However,  structural   shortcomings  in  the  labour  market  (such  as  a  high   share   of   long-term   unem ployed)   are   expected   to    remain.  Due to the ongoing appreciati on of the koruna, falling  food   prices,   favourable   base   effects   and   strong    competition,  HICP  inflation  in   2005  was  only  1.6%.   As  a  consequence  of  high   energy  prices,  inflation   somewhat  increased  towards  the  end  of  2005  and  re- entered the target band set by  the monetary authorities  (CPI  inflation  of  3%  year  on  year  +/-1  percentage   points  since  2006).  Inflation  is  expected  to  further   increase   in   the   first   half   of   2006.   However,   the    second-round  effects  of  increased  energy  prices  are   projected  to  be  weak  and  in flation  should  grow  only   gradually  in  the  second  half  of  the  year.  Average   HICP inflation is expected to reach 2½% in 2006 and  accelerate slightly in 2007.  Public finances  The  government  deficit  ratio  in  2005  was  -2½%  of   GDP, after about -3% in 2004. This development was  due  to  the  favourable  eco nomic  situation  and  fiscal   targeting  introduced  in  20 04.  More  importantly,  the   low deficits in latest years reflect th e possibility given to  government  departments  to  carry  over  unspent   funds,  rather  than  intenti onal  and  durable  spending   cuts. The cumulativ e sum of expenditure carryovers is  currently   estimated   at   some   1¾%   of   GDP.   The    uncertainty    about    when     these    funds    will    be     accumulated and when they will be spent complicates  the  forecasting  of  public  finances.  This  budgetary   forecast assumes cumulated expenditure carryovers to  remain constant in  2006 and 2007.  In 2006, the general governme nt deficit is projected to  reach some 3¼% of GDP. The forecast is based on the  fiscal  target  set  by  the  Czech  authorities  (-3.8%  of   GDP), but is more optimistic ab out revenues.   On the  expenditure  side,  the  forecast  takes  account  of  a  debt   cancellation  of  about  ¼%  of  GDP.  The  budgetary   outcome  is  thus  expected  to  be  more  than  half  a   percentage  point  worse  than  in   2005,  in  spite  of  the   strong economic performance.   The  2007  deficit  is  projected  to  reach  about  3½%  of   GDP which is slightly more  than the targeted 3.3% of  GDP. It is assumed that  the planned nominal medium- term  expenditure  ceiling  will  be  exceeded,  as  in  the   2006   draft   budget,   in   order   to   finance   recently    introduced  additional  so cial  spending.  The  structural   budgetary  balance  is  forecast  to  worsen  in  both  2006   and 2007.  Government   debt   –   which   was   recently   revised    downwards  because  of  the  reclassification  of  a  state   guarantee  –  is  expected  to  increase  from  30½%  of   GDP in 2005 to some 32 ½% at the end of 2007. 		
April/2006	Denmark	More broadly-based growth 	In    2005,    the    Danish    economy    gained    further     momentum.  Despite  hesitant  first  and  last  quarters,   real  GDP  growth  reached  3.1%  for  the  year  as  a   whole,  following  1.9%  in   2004.  As  in  2004,  private   consumption  continued  to  be  a  main  driving  force,   supported  in  particular  by   a  booming  housing  market   with  price  increases  of  above  20%  in  the  fourth   quarter,  low  interest  rates  and  falling   unemployment.   However, investments also  took off in 2005 and grew  overall  by  9%.  The  increase   in  investment  activity   was   particularly   strong   for    both   construction   and    equipment, although investment  in equipment showed  a  rather  erratic  behaviour  over  the  year.  Moreover,   public consumption expanded  and grew by more than  1¼%,   well   above   the   ½%    objective   set   by   the    government,   which   can   be    partly   explained   by    overspending  by  local  governments.  All  in  all  the   contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth was  4 percentage points.  As  for  the  external  sector,   both  exports  and  imports   accelerated  in  2005.  Exports  of  goods  and  services   grew by almost 8% and benefited from strong growth  in both the US economy  and in Asia, as well as from a  strong  US  dollar.  However,  due  to  buoyant  private   consumption  and  a  high  import   content  in  exports,   import  growth  of  about  11%  was  higher  than  that  of   exports.   Consequently,   net   exports   continued   to    contribute negatively to GD P growth by 1 percentage  point, although less than  the year before.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Economic  indicators  give  a  very  positive  picture  of   the  short-term  prospects  for  the  Danish  economy.   Consumer  confidence  is  at  a  historically  high  level   and  overall  consumers  are  extremely  satisfied  with   their personal economic situa tion and with the general  economic  situation.  Business  confidence  is  also  at   relatively  high  historical  levels,  with  the  industrial,   construction  and  services   sectors  all  positive  about   production and sales.  Against   this   setting,   GDP    growth   is   expected   to    continue to grow steadily and  above potential over the  forecast  period  at  about  3¼%  in  2006  and  2¼%  in   2007. Compared with 2005, gr owth is projected to be  supported  not  only  by  robust  domestic  demand,  but   also     by     growing     external     demand.     Private      consumption is expected to moderate somewhat as the  effects of tax cuts on real disposable income fade out  and  as  the  wealth  effects  of  the  sharp  increase  in   house   prices   taper   off.   At    the   present   juncture,    however,  it  is  not  clear  to   what  extent  higher  interest   rates  and  thereby  higher  fi nancing  costs  may  limit   further    increases    in    house    prices.    Moreover,     investment  is  envisaged  to  continue  to  grow  strongly   over  the  forecast  period  and  to  contribute  to  more   balanced  economic  growth.  Finally,  exports  of  goods   and services are forecast to continue growing steadily,  benefiting  from  an  econo mic  upswing  in  Europe  and   an  expansion  of  Denmark's  export  markets.  With   imports    dampening    somewhat    in    line    with    a     moderation  in  private  consumption,  net  exports  are   also expected to contribute to economic growth, albeit  rather modestly.   Labour market, cost and prices  In    2005,    employment    picked    up    strongly    and     unemployment   fell   to   ve ry   low   levels.   Despite    shortages of labour in certain sectors, there are so far  few  signs  of  mounting  wa ge  pressures  in  the  overall   economy   and   wage-driven   inflation.   This   can   be    explained  by  the  typically   lagged  response  of  the   labour  market  to  the   business  cycle.  Moreover,  it  is   likely   that   increasing   comp etition   from   emerging    markets is also playing a role, in so far as the threat of  outsourcing   and   import   of   labour   is   having   a    dampening   effect   on   wages.   Nevertheless,   as   the    expansion  of  the  economy  continues  and  the  labour   market  tightens  further,  wage  pressures  are  expected   to gradually grow stronger over the forecast period.   After  historically  low  consumer  price  inflation  in   2004,  which  was   due  to  the  temporary  effects  of  tax  cuts and low import prices, the rate increased in 2005.  This  was  largely  due  to  rising  energy  prices,  while   domestic    inflation    remained    relatively    subdued.     However,   as   capacity   and   wage   pressures   in   the    economy are expected to grow stronger, domestically  generated  inflation  is  now   expected  to  pick  up.  This,   together   with   continuingly    high   energy   prices,   is    expected  to  lead  to  a  further  increase  in  consumer   price    inflation.    Headline     inflation    is    therefore     projected to be around 2% thro ughout 2006 an d 2007.     Public finances   After  a  surplus  of  2.7%  of  GDP  in  2004,  the  general   government  recorded  a  surplus  of  close  to  5%  in   2005.  In  addition  to  the  effects  of  healthy  economic   growth,  the  strength  of  the  public  finances  is  largely   due  to  higher  revenue  from  oil  and  gas  exploitation   and  from  the  pension  yield  tax,  where  higher  prices   and    favourable    financial    market    developments     respectively  have  boosted  tax  revenues.  It  should  be   noted that the surplus figures used by the Commission  services, in contrast to the Danish National Accounts,  will  include  the  surplus  of  the  second  pillar  pension   fund  until  spring  2007,  wh ich  improves  the  general   government  surplus  by  about  1  percentage  point  of   GDP.   In   the   forecast   period,   lower   revenues   from   the    pension  fund  yield  tax  and,   later  on,  a  moderation  in   growth  of  economic  activity  are  expected  to  translate   into  somewhat  lower   surpluses.  Nevertheless,  with   continued  relatively  stro ng  surpluses  the  gross  debt   ratio is expected to be reduc ed further, to below 30%  of GDP in 2007. 		
April/2006	Germany	Gradual recovery dominated by the effects of budgetary measures 	Real   GDP   growth   was   rather   volatile   in   2005.    Substantial advances of 0.6% in  the first and the third  quarters,  respectively,  were  followed  by  a  moderate   second  and  a  disappointing  fin al  quarter.  In  the  last   three  months  of  2005,  the  negative  contribution  to   growth from both domestic and external demand was  counterbalanced by an extraordina rily strong  build-up  of inventories, resulting in  a flat profile for real GDP  in    the    fourth    quarter.    While    the    uncertainty     surrounding    the    working    day    effect    makes    a     substantial  revision  of  the  growth  composition  in  the   final  quarter  of  2005  likely,  the  overall  picture  of  a   modest, export-driven recovery is still intact.   As  in  2004,  external  demand  provided  the  biggest   contribution  to  overall  GDP  growth.  While  stock- building  also  had  a  positiv e  impact,  final  domestic   demand again did not contribute to growth.  Continued    wage    restraint     helped    to    maintain     international price competitiven ess and export market  shares.  On  the  downside,  low  wage  growth  and  a   further     fall     in     empl oyment     curbed     private      consumption   expenditure   and   gross   fixed   capital    formation in 2005.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  The   latest   indicators   are   sending   mixed   signals    regarding  the  strength  of  the  economic  recovery  in   Germany. Seasonally adjusted unemployment slightly  increased  in  March  and  households'  future  earnings   expectations dropped for a  second straight month. On  the  other  hand,  the   ifo   index  suggests  th at  business   confidence  reached  its  highest  level  for  15  years  and   also    the     GfK     consumer    climate    index    surged,     indicating a possible release  of some pent-up demand  in the run-up to the 3 pe rcentage point  increase in the  standard VAT rate as from January 2007.   Indeed,  the  cyclical  pattern  will  be  dominated  by  the   budgetary  measures  that  are   part  of  the  coalition   agreement  and  which  will  have  significant  effects   even beyond the forecast horizon (see Box 2.2).   The    underlying    trend    of    private    consumption     expenditure  remains  moderate,  as  employment  will   only  gradually  pick  up  and  the  inflationary  effects  of   the   VAT   increase   will   weigh   on   real   disposable    income in 2007. However, households are expected to  bring  forward  some  purchases  of  durable  consumer   goods in anticipation of the VAT increase. As a result,  private  consumption  is  pr ojected  to  strongly  increase   in   2006   and   to   sli ghtly   fall   in   the   next   year.    Correspondingly,   the   household   savings   rate   is    forecast   to   decrease   significantly   in   2006   and   to    remain at a lower level in 2007.  Similarly,    the    carry-forward    effect    for    housing     investment  should  be  substantial,  with  an  equally   strong  negative  echo  effect  in   2007.  Consequently,   gross  fixed  capital  formation  will  receive  a  boost  in   the current year before subsiding in 2007.   Labour market, costs and prices  The   situation   on   the   labo ur   market   is   finally    improving, as job losses, in  particular for jobs subject  to  social  security  contributions,  are  bottoming  out.   While   in   the   cu rrent   year   employment   gains   are   expected to be large for part-time jobs, growth of full- time  employment  is  projected  to  accelerate  over  the   forecast  period.  Hence,  unemployment  will  further   recede in 2006 and 2007.   More  favourable  developments  on  the  labour  market   and solid company profits ar e prompting trade unions  to  demand  higher  wage  increases  after  several  years   of  wage  restraint.  Thou gh  effective  pay  will  continue   to  increase  by  less  than  contractual  wages,  private   sector  wages  and  salaries  are  expected  to  increase  in   2006  and  2007.  Nevert heless,  unit  labour  costs  are   expected to further decline up to the forecast horizon,  as productivity growth will again outpace the increase  in compensation per employee in 2006 and employers'  contributions   to   unempl oyment   insurance   will   be    lowered   as   from   2007.   Developments   in   external    competitiveness will thu s remain favourable.  As   a   result   of   the   temporary   boost   to   domestic    demand,  imports  are  forecast  to  increase  strongly  in   2006 and the contribution to growth of external trade  is  expected  to  temporarily  turn  negative.  In  the  next   year,   the   external   surplu s   will   widen   again   and    significantly contribute to overall GDP growth.  With  wage  increases  remaining  moderate  and  the   effects  of  the  surge  in  oil  prices   fading,  inflationary   pressures  should  slacken  in  the  rest  of  this  year.  In   2007   HICP   inflation   will   be    driven   by   the   3    percentage point increase in the standard VAT rate, of  which  two  thirds  is  expected  to  be  passed  through  to   consumer prices.  Public finances  The  general  government  deficit  edged  down  to  3.3%   of  GDP  in  2005,  from  3.7%  in  2004,  the  decrease   being driven by structural developments as the deficit  in  cyclically-adjusted  te rms  was  reduced  from  3.4%   of GDP to 3.0%. Tax revenues increased by 2.1%. In  particular,  direct  taxes  showed  strong  growth  despite   the  final  stage  of  tax  cuts  passed  in  2000,  which   provided  considerably  less  relief  for  households  than   projected.  Indirect  taxes  yielded  stronger  revenues   than  implied  by  tax  base  developments,  reflecting   strong  growth  of  local  ta xes.  Subsidy  repayments  by   several Landesbanken  and the introduction of the road  toll for lorries added to revenues.  General government expenditure increased by 1.1% in  nominal terms in 2005, resulti ng in a slight fall in the  expenditure  share  in  GDP.   The  public  wage  bill  was   contained   by   wage   restra int   and   by   personnel    reduction. Pension outlays have  grown less than GDP,  as pensions are indexed to wage developments with a  lag,  although  the  number  of  beneficiaries  is  rising.  A   government  decision  prevent ed  cuts  in  nominal  per   capita  benefits,  which  would  have  followed  from  the   adjustment   mechanism   in   force.   As   a   result,   the    liquidity  fund  of  the  pensi on  system  has  been  further   depleted.  The  dampening  effect  of  the  2004  health   care  reform  abated  in  2005;  health  care  expenditure   increased  by  3.1%  in  2005,  after  decreasing  by  the   same percentage in the previous year.  Payments     from     the     unemployment     insurance      decreased    significantly    in     2005.    Although    the     unemployment    rate    acco rding    to    the    Eurostat     definition  remained  constan t,  the  number  of  benefit   recipients  declined,  since  some  were  transferred  into   the new system of social assistance and others moved  into  subsidised  self-em ployment.  Moreover,  active   labour market policies were reduced. The new system  of  social  assistance  ("Hartz  IV")  did  not  deliver  the   budgetary  savings  expected   by  the  government,  since   problems in design and administrative frictions during  the  transition  period  resu lted  in  more  recipients  than   expected.  In 2006, the general government deficit is expected to  decline  to  3.1%  of  GDP,  larg ely  owing  to  improved   cyclical   conditions,   while   the   cyclically-adjusted    deficit   is   expected   to   remain   broadly   constant.    Revenues  are  projected  to  increase  by  1.3%.  Newly   introduced     measures     widen     some     direct     tax      allowances   and   cut   back   others.   For   example,    depreciation rules on non-fixed capital are made more  generous   and   some   household   services   are   being    granted     tax-favourable     treatment.     In     contrast,      loopholes    on    tax-saving    investment    funds    are     removed. Regarding indirect taxes, the method of tax  collection from small businesses is changed, resulting  in  tax  losses  in  20 06.  Overall,  the  fiscal  effects  of   these  measures  tend  to  cancel  out.  However,  indirect   tax  revenues  will  be  boosted ,  as  taxable  consumption   is  brought  forward  from  2007.  Companies  have  to   carry forward their monthly so cial contributions from  the  middle  of  the  following  month  to  the  end  of  the   month  when  the  payment   is  due.  This  will  lead  to   thirteen    instead    of    twelve    pa yments    in    2006,     providing  temporary   cash  relief  until  2007.  This  is   budget  neutral  in  ESA95   accrual  accounting  rules,  so  that the social security system would record deficits in  2006  and  2007.  The  2005  Bundesbank  profit  adds   revenues to the amount of 0.1% of GDP in 2006.   General  government  expenditure  is  projected  to  grow   by  0.8%  in  2006 ,  resulting  in  a  reduction  in  the   expenditure share in GDP by 0.5 of a percentage point  compared  with  2005.  Active  labour  market  policies   are  being  stepped  up,   while  tightening  means-testing   for   social   benefit   recipients.   New   subsidies   and    additional     spending     on     road     and     rail     road      infrastructure will add to  expenditure. The abolition of  the  subsidy  on  owner-occupied  housing  will  make  a   growing    contribution    to    consolidation.    Pension     expenditure  will  rise  only   slightly.  The  public  sector   wage  agreements  continue  to  contribute  substantially   to consolidation in  2006 and 2007.  In  2007,  the  general  government  deficit,  projected  at   2.5%  of  GDP,  would  fall  well  below  the  Treaty   reference value. The increase in the central VAT rate  from  16%  to  19%  should   add  almost  1%  of  GDP  to   revenues.  On  the  other  hand,  the  government  has   adopted  legislation  to  lower  the  contribution  rate  to   the  unemployment  insurance  from  6.5%  to  4.5%  and   intends to increase the pe nsion contribution rate from  19.5%  to  19.9%,  which  might   not  be  sufficient  to   keep  the  pension  system  in  balance.  Under  current   legislation,  public  h ealth  insurers  are  projected  to   increase  contribution  rates  by  ½  a  percentage  point.   Overall,  the  revenue  share  in  GDP  is  expected  to   remain  broadly  constant  compared  with  2006.  The   expenditure  share  should  decline  by  ½  a  percentage   point  or  more,  reflecting   public  sector  wage  restraint   and reductions in labo ur-market-related spending.  With  low  nominal  GDP  growth,  the  public  debt  ratio   is  projected  to  increase  from  67.7%  of  GDP  in  2005   to 69.2% in 2007, desp ite dampening effects expected  from  the  above-mentioned  cash  relief  in  the  social   systems and from privatisations. 		
April/2006	Estonia	Buoyant activity, but risk of overheating remaining contained 	According  to  preliminary  national  accounts  data,  real   GDP   growth   rose   to   a   hi gh   9.8%   in   2005.   The    quarterly profile of y-o- y growth rates shows a strong  acceleration   over   the   year.   While   export   growth    expanded  by  more  than  20%  in  real  terms,  imports   remained  below  that  growt h  rate,  and  thus  the  net   export    contribution    was    pos itive    in    2005,    a     development which supported a distinct improvement  on  the  trade  balance.  Private  consumption  expanded   strongly,   too,   fuelled   by    significant   increases   in    households'  disposable  in come.  However,  investment   grew     fastest     among     the     domestic     demand      components, at above 13 %. Construction benefited in  particular from a housing boom driven by lively credit  expansion.  Although    foreign    trade     data    remain    somewhat     unreliable following several  methodological revisions  since  EU  accession,  they  suggest  a  trend  reversal  in   the  sizeable  external  imbalance:  the  external  account   deficit for 2005 turned out at below 10% of GDP, and  the  current  account  deficit  at  around  10  ½%  of  GDP   which     constitutes     a      two     percentage     points      improvement     as     compared     with     2004.     The      improvement occurred primarily on the trade of goods  balance, while the services  surplus declined.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  The economy is projected to remain on a firm growth  path over the forecast period. While 2006 will benefit  from  a  strong  carry-over  effect,  data  on  trade  and   industrial production indicate some deceleration. Also  price  developments  in  the  real  estate  sector  suggest   some  cooling  of  demand  since  early  2006.  Thus,   annual  growth  in  2006 -2007  is  expected  at  around  8- 9%, converging towards potential output at the end of  the forecast period.  Final  domestic  demand  is  expected  to  continue  to   drive   growth,   primarily    led   by   investment,   with    housing  construction  still  increasing  strongly.  Private   consumption is also expected to remain robust, due to  a    healthy    combination    of    employment    growth,     continued   whitening   of   some   parts   of   the   grey    economy   and   substan tial   real   wage   gains.   The    competitive   cost   advantag e   and   rapidly   growing    productivity   gains   will   continue   to   boost   export    growth.   Net   exports   are   projected   to   provide   a    positive  contribution  to  gr owth  also  in  2006,  despite   deteriorating   terms   of   trade   caused   primarily   by    higher  energy  import  pri ces.  However,  in  2007  the   export  contribution  to  growth  is  projected  to  turn   negative again, with private consumption expenditure  driving imports.  Throughout  the  forecast  period,  the  external  account   deficit  is  expected  to  narrow   steadily  to  less  than  8%   of  GDP.  Further  improvements  on  the  trade  balance   are projected to be supported by public sector savings.  Labour market, costs and prices  Strong economic growth has c ontributed to significant  employment   growth   and    a   marked   reduction   of    unemployment  last  year.  In  line  with  the  projected   expansion   of   construction   output   and   continued    dynamic  growth  in  the  ser vice  sector  (in  particular   tourism),  employment  ga ins  are  likely  to  continue  in   2006  and  2007,  albeit  at  a  slower  pace.  Labour  force   growth,  after  taking  account  of  significant  outward   migration   (chiefly   towards    the   ‘old’   EU   Member    States) and negative demographi c  trends,  is  projected   to  remain  sluggish.  As  a  result,  the  unemployment   rate  is  estimated  to  decrease  further,  as  could  be   observed  during  the  firs t  quarter  of  2006.  Active   employment    measures    have    st arted    to    mitigate     regional disparities.   Given  the  flexibility   of  the  Estonian  labour  market,   and the virtual absence of automatic wage indexation,  wages are estimated to grow broadly in line or slightly  below  productivity  increases  which  are  expected  to   remain high both in 2006 and 2007. A continuation of  cuts  in  personal  income   tax  rates  at  one  percentage   point  per  year  over  the  forecast  period,  and  a  one-off  cut  in  the  unemploymen t  insurance  contribution  rate   in  2006  will  allow  net  wag es  to  grow  more  rapidly   than  gross  wages,  an  effect  also  observed  in  recent   years.  The  risk  to  this  outlo ok  lies  primarily  with  the   rapid  tightening  of  the  labour  market,  which  could   increase wage pressures.  Annual HICP inflation increased from 3% in 2004 to  4.1  %  in  2005,  reflecting  base  effects  from  EU- accession-related  price  rises  (notably  for  fuel  and   food) in the first half of  2005 and strong energy price  increases  in  the  second  half  of  the  year.  Inflation   eased  to  3½  %  in  late  2005   as  the  oil  price  increase   abated,  but  picked  up  again  to  4.4  %  in  the  first   quarter  of  2006  reflecting  a  renewed  rise  of  oil  and   heat   energy   prices.   Core   inflation   remained   at    considerably  more  moderate   levels,  suggesting  the   absence  of  significant  second-round  effects  from  the   oil   price   hike.   A   postponement   of   excise   duty    increases   is   expected   to   alleviate   inflation.   The    forecast projects a gradual deceleration of inflation in  2006  and  2007,  with  th e  headline  rate  settling  at   around  3%  next  year.  This   outlook  strongly  depends   on    energy    price    as    well    as    exchange    rate     developments,   while   an   increase   of   inflationary    pressures   due   to   high   ec onomic   growth   and   a    tightening labour market rem ains a potential risk.   Public finances  Estonia's  public  finances  are  among  the  strongest  in   the  EU.  The  budgetary  situat ion  is  forecast  to  remain   comfortable  over  the  forecast  period,  with  general   government  surpluses  hovering  around  1  –  1  ½%  of   GDP despite further income tax cuts and the recently  announced  postponement  of  planned  increases  to  a   number  of  excise  duties,  namely  on  tobacco,  alcohol   and fuel.  Government   debt,   already   the   lowest   among   EU    Member  States,    is  forecast  to  decline  further  to   around 3% of GDP by  the end of 2007. 		
April/2006	Greece	Strong economic activity fuels large external imbalances 	After  two  years  of  strong  economic  activity,  2005   brought  a  slowdown  of  real  GDP  growth,  to  3.6%.   Although  the  planned  fiscal  consolidation  and  the   petering  out  of  the  ‘Olympic  bonus’  has  weighed  on   growth  prospects,  this  outcome  is  slightly  better  than   was  expected  last  autumn.  The  economic  slowdown   originated  in  a  deceleration  of  the  domestic  sector,   while,  after  several  years  of  negative  contributions,   net  exports  added  to  growth.  In  line  with  the  less   buoyant  growth  recorded  in   real  disposable  income,   private consumption decelerated, while the strong fall  recorded   by   public   infrast ructure   expenditure   in    nominal  terms  led  to  a  contraction  of  investment  of   about  1%.  In  spite  of  fiscal  consolidation  efforts,   public  consumption  actua lly  grew  above  3%.  The   positive  contribution  of  the   external  sector  to  growth   does   not   reflect   prosperou s   exports,   but   rather   a    contraction  of  imports.  Exp orts  of  goods  grew  at   above  8%  and  led  to  an  almost  1  percentage  point   external  sector  contribution  to   growth,  in  spite  of   stagnation  in  exports  of   services,  specially  shipping.   In  line  with  the  economic  slowdown,  employment   decelerated,  while  inflation  accelerated,  fuelled  by   higher  energy  prices  a nd  still  strong  wage  increases,   thus  further  widening  th e  differential  with  the  euro- area average.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  While  the  Greek  economy  is  projected  to  decelerate   marginally   over   the   forecast   horizon,   significant    changes   in   growth   composition   are   expected.   In    particular,     economic     activity     will     be     almost      exclusively   demand-driv en.   GDP   should   grow   at    3½% in 2006 (slightly less in  2007). The combination  of moderate wage and employment growth, leading to  lower disposable income growt h, and higher oil prices  should  slow  down  privat e  consumption.  However,   consumption  will  still  grow  above  income,  gradually   lowering   the   households’   saving   rate.   Moreover,    households’   net   borrowing   will   rise,   as   housing    investment     is     increasing .     In     parallel,     public      consumption   should   not   increase   in   2006.   Total    investment  will  rebound,  than ks  to  the  recovery  of   public   infrastructure   investment,   while   the   new    incentive laws, aiming at promoting investments, and  the   corporate   tax   reform   should   support   private    investment.   In   spite   of   this,   higher   profits   will    contribute  to  improve  the  corporate  sector’s  balance   sheets.  All  in  all,  domestic  demand  is  projected  to   contribute  around  3½  pe rcentage  points  to  growth  in   2006 and 3¾ in 2007 . The external sector is projected  to   be   growth-neutral   in    2006,   while   contributing    negatively  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  period.  Imports   are  expected  to  return  to  growth  rates  of  about  5%.   Although  projected  to  grow   at  around  a  healthy  7%   over  the  forecast  period,  exp orts  of  goods  are  not   expected  to  keep  pace  with  world  trade.  However,   after   the   strong   correction   last   year,   exports   of    services  should  return  to  growth  rates  much  more  in   line  with  long-run  trends  over  the  forecasting  period.   Also  helped  by  an  upward   trend  in  tourism.  As  a   result, the external deficit is pr ojected to fall by more  than  1  percentage  point,  to  below  6½%  of  GDP  by   2007.  Labour market, costs and prices  Consistent  with  decelerating  but  still  robust  GDP   growth,  employment 1   is  projected  to  grow  above  1%   per  year  until  2007.  The  un employment  rate  should   accordingly  decrease  by  1  percentage  point  to  just   below  10%  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  period.  Wages   per head are set to rise more in 2006 and less in 2007  compared to last year. However, since productivity is  expected  to  remain  stable,  wage  moderation  should   not  result  in  a  significant  deceleration  of  unit  labour   costs; rather, they should increase above the euro-area  average.   Such   wage   developments,   coupled   with    sustained  domestic  demand  and   higher  energy  prices,   should fuel inflation, wh ich would remain above 3¼%  over  the  forecast  period.  As  a  result,  real  unit  labour   costs should continue on an upward trend until 2007. Public finances  The  government  deficit  in  2005  was  4.5%  of  GDP 2 . This  is  ¾%  of  GDP  above  the  autumn  2005  forecast,   which  included  one-off  revenues  from  an  announced   securitisation  operation  worth  0.8%  of  GDP,  which   did   not   in   the   end   take   place.   The   2005   deficit    outcome is an improvement on 2004’s figure of above  2¼%  of  GDP  in  nominal  terms.  In  structural  terms,   the  deficit  improved  from   7¾%  of  GDP  in  2004  to   5¼%   last   year.   The   2006   deficit   is   projected   to    decline  further  to  just   below  3%  of  GDP  (the  table   shows   it   as   3%   due   to   rounding).   The   forecast    includes  half  of  the  0.6%  of  GDP  temporary  one-off   operations  planned  in  the  budget  as  a  result  of  the   need  for  clarification  on  the  accounting  treatment.   However,  the  government  has  recently  released  a   permanent measure amounting to 0.1% of GDP and a  temporary measure amounting to ¼% of GDP that are  included   in   the   forecast.   In   structural   terms,   the    adjustment   is   expend iture-driven.   Specifically,   the    measures to improve tax administration, coupled with  the broadening of tax bases brought about by the fight  against  tax  fraud  and  evasion,  should  raise  revenues   by less than ¼% of GDP.  In parallel, expenditure will  fall  by  ¾%  of  GDP,  less  than  half  of  which  is   accounted   for   by   the   control   of   primary   current    spending. Overall, the stru ctural deficit is projected to  improve  by  around  1%  of  GDP  in  2006.  Assuming   unchanged  legislation,  the  deficit  projection  for  2007   will  be  around  3½%  of  GDP,  which  shows  that   structural  measures  will  be  necessary  to  keep  the   deficit  below  3%  in  a  durable  manner.  Finally,  at   107.5% of GDP in 2005, the general government debt  is projected to decrease only slightly by 2007. 		
April/2006	Spain	Cooling at home, worsening external deficit 	GDP  growth  increased  in   2005  to  3½%,  from  just   above    3%    in    2004.     Economic    activity    was     underpinned by dynamic domestic demand, while net  exports  continued  to  cont ribute  negatively  to  growth.   Private  consumption  remain ed  robust,  supported  by   strong  job  creation  and  easy   monetary  and  financial   conditions,  and  grew  above   real  disposable  income,   thus  further  lowering  the  households’  saving  rate  to   10½% in 2005, from 11% in  2004. Easy monetary and  financial   conditions   were    also   largely   behind   the    recorded   acceleration   in   household   investment   in    dwellings,  pushing  indebtedn ess  close  to  115%  of   disposable  income.  This   has  increased  households’   exposure  to  interest  rates  and  employment  shocks.   Investment   in   equipment    also   remained   robust.    Although    government    consumption    decelerated,     domestic  demand  contributed  around  5½  percentage   points to growth in 2005.  The external sector  recorded large imbalances again.  In 2005, its negative contribution to growth was close  to  2  pps.  Imports  grew  at  7%  in  real  terms,  while   exports  presented  a  rather  flat  profile,  rising  by  a   meagre  1%.  In  particular,  the  trade  deficit  increased   by  more  than  1  pp  of  GDP  to  reach  7½%.  Widening   external      imbalances      mirror      the      continuous       deterioration   of   the   competitive   position   of   the    Spanish economy, asso ciated with high  and persistent  inflation  and  productivity-growth  differentials  with   the  euro  area.  HICP  rose  to  just  below  3½%,  while   productivity grew marg inally (<¼%), which compares  with 2¼% and ½%, respectively, in the euro area.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  In  2006,  GDP  growth  is   projected  to  slightly  fall,  to   3.1%.  Economic  activity  should  still  be  based  on   buoyant   domestic   demand,   as,   in   spite   of   higher    interest rate expectations, higher inflation is projected  to  keep  real  interest  rates  in   the  red,  which,  in  turn,   should   push   private   consumption   to   grow   above    disposable income. As a  result, the househ olds' saving  rate should continue on a decreasing path, declining to  just  above  9½%.  In  parallel,   household  debt  should   rise   to   around    120%   of   annual    gross   disposable    income.  Investment  is  projected  to  remain  robust,   especially    in    equipment    and    software,    whereas     residential    construction     growth    is    expected    to     moderate.  Overall,  domestic  demand  is  projected  to   contribute  4½  percentage  po ints  to  GDP  growth  this   year. In   spite   of   the   slowdown   projected   for   domestic    demand,   imports   are   expected   to   decelerate   only    marginally  since  the  worsening   of  the  competitive   position of the Spanish industry should also affect the  domestic   market.   Although   export   growth   should    increase to around 2% this year, compared with 1% in  2005,  deteriorating  external   competitiveness  should   keep  exports  growing  well  below  world  trade,  thus   further reducing export market shares. This projection  takes  account  of  potentially  better  prospects  in  the   automotive  sector,  underpinned   by  the  launch  of  new   models  by  several  car  manufacturers.  Overall,  the   negative contribution from net exports to GDP growth  is projected to be close to 1¼ percentage points, while  the  trade  deficit  should  conti nue  to  widen  to  slightly  below 8½% of GDP.  GDP  is  projected  to  furt her  slow  down  in  2007.   Higher interest rate expectations should at last lead to  positive    interest    rates    in    real    terms,    further     decelerating  private  consumption  and  putting  a  brake   on investment in dwellings.  The latter should lead to a  slight  deceleration  of  gross  fixed  capital  formation.   The  projected  stagnation  of   residential  construction   (although  at  a  very  high  activ ity  level),  should  be   largely offset by stronger act ivity in infrastructure, as  well  as  in  investment  in  equipment  and  software.  In   parallel,   the   households'    saving   rate,   with   gross    disposable   income   growing   at   a   similar   pace   as    private  consumption,  should  at  last  remain  stable  at   around 9½% of disposable in come, putting an end to a  decreasing saving ratio since 2003. Overall, domestic  demand  would  still  contribute  to  GDP  growth  by   around 3¾ pe rcentage points.  The   projected   deceleration   of   domestic   demand    should  further  moderate  im port  growth.  However,   since  no  significant  improvements  are  expected  in   terms     of     productivity      growth     and     inflation      differentials   between   Spai n   and   its   main   trade    partners,  exports  are  expected  to  grow  by  only  2¼%,   thus leading to further losses of export market shares.  The  trade  deficit  might  peak  at  9%  of  GDP.  Overall,   the  negative  contributio n  to  GDP  growth  from  the   external sector should decrease to 1 percentage point.  The  evolution  of  the  external  accounts  in  2006  and   2007 deserves sp ecial attention. In sp ite of a rebound  in 2005, declining net tou rism inflows are expected to  further   narrow   the   surplus   recorded   by   services.    Regarding   the   balance   of    primary   incomes,   the    projected  rising  deficit  reflects  payments  stemming   from the large cumulated  debt of the country vis-à-vis  its  foreign  lenders.  The  deficit  in  the  balance  of   current  transfers  should  increase,  partially  as  a  result   of larger remittances abroad by migrants. The surplus  of  services  is  projected  to  just  offset  the  aggregate   deficits  in  the  primary  income  and  current  transfers   accounts.  Consequently,  the  current  account  deficit   mirrors the trade deficit and is expected to rise to 9%  of  GDP  at  the  end  of  the  forecast  period.  The  net   borrowing  position  vis-à-vis   the  rest  of  the  world  is   projected  to  reach  8¾%  of  GDP  in  2007,  on  account   of  the  expected  reduction  of  EU  transfers  by  the  end   of the forecasting period. Since there is no evidence to  support   a   rebound   in   foreign   direct   investment    inflows,   portfolio   investmen ts   should   continue   to    represent the main source of financing for the external  deficit in Spain.   There  are  risks  to  this  scenario.  In  particular,  export   growth  depends  on  a  recovery  of  the  automotive   sector,  which,  if  it  fails  to  materialise,  could  weigh   negatively   on   growth.   Additionally,   some   of   the    current   developments,   name ly,   higher   household    indebtedness,   low   productiv ity   growth,   persistent    inflation  differentials  with  the  euro  area  and  wider   external  imbalances,  are  risks  for  internal  demand   growth. However, neither so ft nor hard data appear to  support a sudden slowdown  of economic activity.   Labour market, costs and prices   Job  creation  is  projected  to  remain  robust  over  the   forecast  period.  In  2005,  employment  grew  slightly   above 3% (full time equivalen t). The regularisation of  immigrants  carried  out  by  the  government  during  the   first half of the year partia lly explains the employment  boom.   In   2006   and   2007,   however,   job   creation    should    decelerate    to    about    2¾%    and    2¼%     respectively,  in  line  with   slower  economic  activity,   especially  in  residential  construction,  which  accounts   for a significant part of the  new jobs created in Spain  in  the  recent  past.  The  unemployment  rate  should   continue  to  fall  over  the  forecast  period,  to  around   8¼% of the labour force by 2007.  Following  the  oil  price  hi ke  in  the  first  and  second   quarters  of  2005,  headline  in flation,  measured  by  the   HICP,  almost  reached  3½%  at  the  end  of  the  year,   while  core  inflation  remained  around  2%.  Since  the   increase  in  energy  prices  is  expected  to  also  have  a   significant  impact  this  year,   inflation  is  projected  to   remain at 3½% in 2006 and gradually ease to slightly  above   3%   in   2007.   Structural   factors   such   as    insufficient    competition    in     certain    utilities    and     services  sectors,  coupled  with  remaining  rigidities  in   the  labour  market,  are  expected  to  keep  the  inflation   differential with the euro area well above 1 percentage  point  over  the  forecasting  horizon.  Compensation  of   employees  per  head  is  projected  to  grow  above  3%   until  the  end  of  the  forecast  period.  Although  the   existing wage agreements sh ould push wage inflation  up,  new  employees  entering  the  labour  market  with   relatively   low   salaries   shou ld   partially   ease   the    pressure. As a result, wages are projected to grow by  around 3½% in nominal terms. Therefore, real wages  should stagnate. In any case, wages are still expected to  grow  above  the  euro-area  average,  thus  mirroring   the  high  and  persisten t  inflation  differential.  Low   productivity  growth  should  result  in  unit  labour  costs   also growing above the euro-area average.   Public finances  In  2005,  the  general  governmen t  registered  a  surplus   above 1% of GDP. In 2006,  a surplus of around 1% of  GDP  is  projected.  This  is  in  line  with  the  updated   2005  Stability  Programme  bu t  well  above  the  2006   Budget  Law,  which  targeted  a  general  government   surplus  of  less  than   ¼%  of  GDP.  The  Budget  Law  is   based   on   underestimated   revenues   for   2005   with    carry-over  effects  in  2006 .  Revenues  in  2006  should   grow  at  around  7½%,  thus  matching  nominal  GDP   growth.  Regarding  central   government  expenditure,   the  2006  Budget  Law  give s  priority  to  R&D  and   infrastructure   expenditure,   which   are   projected   to    grow  in  nominal  terms  by  around  30%  and  12%   respectively.  Overall,  total  expenditures  are  projected   to increase by around 7¾%, somewhat above nominal  GDP.   In  2007,  within  the  framework  of  the  customary  no- policy-change   scenario,   government   revenues   are    projected  to  grow  at   around  5¾%,  slightly  below   nominal   GDP,   although   this    figure   includes   the    potential effects of the direct taxation reform that has  been  enacted.  Total   expenditure  is  assu med  to  follow   previous  trends  and  increase  at  around  7%.  On  this   basis, the general government  surplus could narrow to  around ½% of a percentage point of GDP.   Due  to  primary  surpluses  in   the  vicinity  of  2%,  the   debt-to-GDP   ratio   is   projected   to   continue   on   a    declining  path,  from  43%  of  GDP   in  2005  to  38%  in   2007. 		
April/2006	France	Growth strengthening and becoming more balanced 	In  2005,  economic  growth  lost  momentum  and  GDP   grew by only 1.4% in real terms, compared with 2.1%  in 2004. For the second consecutive year, net exports  negatively  contributed  to  GDP  growth  by  about  1   percentage point.   Despite  a  strong  expansion  of  external  demand,  real   export  growth  remained  su bdued,  while  imports  rose   markedly  (+6.6%),   in  response  to  th e  robustness  of   final  demand.  France  could   not  fully  take  advantage   of  the  expansion  of  world  trade  because  its  export   markets      expanded      more      slowly      and      its       competitiveness  deteriorated.   Contrary  to  what  was   observed  in  the  euro  area  as  a  whole,  GDP  growth   was  therefore  still  exclusively  dr iven  by  domestic   demand and especially by pri vate consumption, which  both    increased    by    2.1%.    Private    consumption     remained  supported  by   buoyant  wage  increases  and   favourable  monetary  and  financial  conditions.  The   gradual    harmonisation    of    the    minimum    wage,     implemented from 2003 onwards in the context of the  reduction  of  the  wo rking  week  to  35  hours,  still   supported  wages  in  2005,   but  this  process  is  now   complete.  Inflation  was  fairly  moderate  despite  the   surge  in  oil  prices  and  also   contributed  to  supporting   households'   purchasing    power,   while   employment    growth      was      disappointing      (+0.2%).      In      a       macroeconomic     context     still     characterised     by      uncertainties, firms remained  cautious with respect to  their   hiring   and   investme nt   plans.   Nevertheless,    boosted by favourable financi al conditions, residential  construction accelerated in 2004.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007   Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate somewhat  in  2006  to  return  to  its   potential  in  2007.  Economic   activity   should   be    more   balanced:   although   GDP    growth   is   expected   to   still   be   largely   driven   by    domestic   demand,   over   the   forecast   period   the    contribution of net exports   to GDP growth should be  less negative and turn neut ral by the end of 2007.  Private  consumption  is  forecast  to  remain  the  main   driving   force   of   economic   growth,   based   on   an    expected  recovery  in  employ ment.  Consumption  will   increase  in  line  with  households'  disposable  income,   reflecting  the  expected  rise  in  the  demand  for  labour.   The  projected  benign  inflation  outlook  should  also   support   households’   purchasing   power.   Moreover,    consumer  spending  would  be  supported  by  a  still   quite strong housing market.   Investment   in   equipment   is   expected   to   slightly    decelerate in 2006 due to a continued deterioration of  corporate  margins  a nd  a  capacity  utilisation  which   remains  below  its  long-term   average.  In  2007,  this   tendency  is  likely  to  be  reversed  due  to  a  more   positive   economic   outlook,    continuing   supportive    financing  conditions  and  the  retention  of  lower  tax   rates    on    new    capital    expenditure.    In    contrast,     investment   in   construction   is   forecast   to   remain    buoyant over the forecast period, thanks to historically  favourable mortgage fin ancing conditions.   After  a  loss  in  export  market  shares  in  2005  for  the   third  consecutive  year,  export  volumes  are  projected   to  increase  again  more  in  lin e  with  the  expansion  of   external demand in connection with the improvement in    price    competitiveness    linked    to    the    past     depreciation  of  the  euro  and  to  a  somewhat  stronger   impulse from France’s main trading partners (notably  Germany  and  Italy).  In  th is  context,  and  although   imports  are  forecast  to  remain  buoyant    as  a  result  of   robust  final  demand,  the  neg ative  contribution  of  net   exports to GDP growth will diminish over time.   Labour markets, costs and prices  In  2005,  employment  growth  barely  reached  0.2%.   Uncertainties    concerning    th e    durability    of    the     recovery    and    the    traditiona l    lag    with    which     employment   reacts   to   economic   activity   largely    explain  the  current  weakness   in  employment  growth.   In  2006  and  2007,  employme nt  growth  is  set  to   gradually  strengthen  in  response  to  better  economic   prospects  over  the  forecast  horizon.  The  recovery  of   employment   should   also   be    stimulated   by   the    implementation of the “em ergency employment plan”  announced  in  June  2005   which  aims  at  facilitating   recruitment   by   small   companies   and   encouraging    people to return to work.  Given   the   still   high    unemployment   rate,   wage    moderation  is  expected  to  c ontinue.  Nevertheless,  a   slight  cyclical  acceleration  in  wages  is  expected  to   occur   over   the   forecast   horizon,   driven   by   the    improvement of the situation in the labour market. As  productivity growth is expected to decelerate from the  high  rate  observed  in  20 04,  unit  labour   costs  should   rise  by  2%  in  2006  and  2007.  Coupled  with  some   second-round    and    indirect    effects    from    high     commodity  prices,  core  inflation  is  thus  projected  to   pick up gradually. Neverth eless, since it is difficult for  companies  to  fully  pass  th e  increase  in  commodity   prices onto final customers due  to strong competition  from   low-cost   countries,    the   rise   in   prices   of    manufactured goods will be  modest. Although growth  is expected to be firmer, inflationary pressures should  remain  subdued  due  to  the  persistent  negative  output   gap. In this context, HICP inflation should be slightly  below 2% in 2006 and in 2007.  Public finances  Following  a  decline  from  4.2%  to  3.7%  of  GDP  in   2004 1 ,  the  general  government  deficit  was  further   reduced to 2.9% in 2005, ma inly thanks to substantial  one-off  revenues  for  a  total  amount  of  0.6%  of  GDP,   in   connection   with   the    inclusion   of   the   specific    electricity and gas companies’ pension schemes in the  general   regime   (0.5%   of    GDP)   and   exceptional    revenues  from  the  December  2005  change  in  the   corporate  tax  code  which  brought  forward  revenue   initially  planned  to  be  co llected  in  2006  (0.1%  of   GDP).  The  budgetary  outturn  also  benefited  from   stronger-than-expected  tax  re ceipts  notably  linked  to   the  strong  performance  of  housing  and  asset  prices.   The  ratio  of  total  revenues   to  GDP  increased  by  1.5   percentage  point  to  51. 0%  of  GDP,  while  the  tax   burden  rose  by  a  full  percentag e  point  to  44.1%  of   GDP. On the expenditure side, targets were respected  at  the  State  level  and  for  health-care  expenditures;   nevertheless   total   public    expenditure   overshot   the    official   target,   mainly   due   to   slippages   in   local    governments    and    other     social    security    funds'     expenditures. All in all,  the expenditure-to-GDP ratio  increased by 0.7 percentage point of GDP to 53.9%.  For   2006,   the   government   deficit   is   expected   to    slightly increase to 3.0% of GDP. Expenditure growth  is anticipated to  slow down somewh at, mainly thanks  to a deceleration in health-care expenditure and other  social  benefits.  On  the  revenue  side,    notably  the   personal  income  tax,  property   tax  and  tax  on  interest   earnings (especially due to a  strong housing and stock  exchange  performance)   should  boost  revenues.  This   should  lead  to  an   elasticity  of  tax  revenues-to-GDP   above  the  long-term  average  of  one  but  somewhat   lower than the high elasticity  registered in 2005. This  forecast  incorporates  new  measures  included  in  the   budget    for    2006    (notably    increases    in    social     contributions resulting from  the implementation of the  2004  health-care  reform,  increases  in  local  taxes,   lower   tax   rates   on   ne w   capital   expenditure,   an    increase    in    the    employment    premium),    which     contribute  to  increase  the  tax  burden  to  44.2%  of   GDP. The forecast also incorporates one-off revenues  of  about  ¼%  of  GDP  in   connection  with  the  transfer   to  social  security  of  pension  commitments  vis-à-vis   the   postal   sector   employees   and   the   exceptional    collection  of  social  contributions  on  specific  saving   plans  that  were  to  be  collected  at  a  latter  stage.  The   general  government  deficit  forecast  is  slightly  above   that contained in the Marc h 2006 French  government  notification  (2.8%  of  GDP),  mainly  due  to  somewhat   higher  expenditures  in  the  areas  of  health  and  local   government.    Concerning     health-care    expenditure,     while  the  2004  health-care  reform  has  noticeably   curbed expenditure, the expected dynamics (an annual  increase in spending of 3.2% in 2006) are  forecast to  be somewhat higher than assumed by the government (2.5%) based on a prudent assessment of some of the  measures announced in the 20 06 budget bill for social  security.   The   Commission   services'   2006   deficit    forecast implies no change in the cyclical balance and  a  slight  improvement  in  the  structural  balance  (CAB   net of one-offs).  The  deficit  forecast  for  2007,  3.1%  of  GDP,  follows   the conventional assumption of unchanged policies. It  thus  takes  only  account  of  already  decided  measures   such  as  (i)  the  income   tax  reform,  (ii)  the  increase  in   the   employment   premium   and   in   the   income   tax    allowance  for  children,  an d  (iii)  lower  tax  rates  on   new   capital   expenditures,    which   will,   altogether,    negatively  impact  the  deficit  by  about  ¼%  of  GDP.   Moreover,  the  forecast  assumes  a  rebound  in  local   investment linked to upcoming local elections in 2008  (as  observed  in  the  past).  Th e  implementation  of  the   unchanged policy assumption implies that the forecast  does   not   include   the    new   expenditure   rules   and    ceilings for the sub-sectors of  the general government  as  announced  in  the  2006   update  of  the  stability   programme, and notably the new rule of a decrease in  the State expenditure by 1%  in volume terms (about - 0.15%  of  GDP),  as  details  are  only  expected  to  be   presented by the Prime Minister in June.  Following  an  increase  by  2. 3%  of  GDP  in  2005,  the   debt-to-GDP  ratio  would  only  slightly  rise  over  the   forecast    horizon    thanks    to    the    allocation    of     privatisation   receipts   to   debt   reduction.   In   2006,    receipts   are   linked   to   the   motorway   companies'    privatisation  (EUR  11  bn)  and  for  2007  the  forecast   includes EUR 7.5 bn of receipts, i.e. the middle of the  announced  range  presented  in  the  2006  update  of  the   stability programme. 		
April/2006	Ireland	Strong growth fuelled by domestic demand 	According  to  the  preliminary  national  accounts,  real   GDP  is  estimated  to  have  grown  by  4.7%  in  2005,   slightly up from 4.5% in the previous year. In contrast  to  the  recent  past,  econom ic  activity  in  2005  was   driven   by   buoyant   domestic   demand   while   the    external  economy  was  a  drag  on  growth.  On  the   domestic side, private consumption growth picked up  strongly  from  more  muted  levels  in  previous  years,   but  the  increase  remained  b elow  the  gains  in  real   disposable  income.  Fixed  invest ment  is  estimated  to   have    expanded    at    a    two-digit    rate,    mirroring     exceptionally strong demand fo r equipment (inter alia  including  some  one-off  purchases  of  aircraft)  and  a   buoyant  construction  sector.  On  the  external  side,   exports  posted  a  subdued   performance  by  historical   standards,   reflecting   a   somewhat   less   favourable    trading     environment     and     a     relatively     weak      performance  of  the  chemical  sector  (in  particular  in   the first half of the year).  Imports strengthened in the  course   of   the   year   in   line    with   the   pick-up   of    consumer demand and fixed capital formation.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  GDP is projected to grow by around 5% in both 2006  and  2007,  close  to  the  rate  commonly  thought  to  be   sustainable  in  the  medium   term.  Domestic  demand   growth   is   expected   to    remain   very   solid.   Private    consumption is expected to accelerate further in 2006  and  2007,  supported  by  healthy  employment  growth   and   notably   by   the   release   of   SSIA   funds   (a    government-sponsored    saving    scheme)    into    the     economy. The growth of fixed  investment is projected  to   moderate   over   the   forecast   period.   Housing    investment is forecast to taper off somewhat in 2007,  as  the  high  volumes  of  completions  are  not  expected   to   be   repeated.   However,   part   of   the   downward    correction  in  the  residential  sector  is  expected  to  be   offset    by    strong    in frastructure    investment    and     commercial  construction.  On  th e  external  side,  both   merchandise  and  service  expor ts  are  projected  to  put   in  a  somewhat  stronger  pe rformance  th an  in  2005.   Import  growth  is  projected  to  pick  up  in  2006  and   2007,   in   line   with   the   acceleration   in   private    consumption  expenditure.  As  net  profit  outflows  are   expected  to  remain  on  an  upward  trend,  the  implied   growth  rate  of  gross  natio nal  income  is  somewhat   lower than that of GDP.   While the most recent data suggest that robust growth  of the Irish economy will continue, recent trends also  reveal that growth has become somewhat imbalanced.  On  the  external  side,  recent  export  weakness  and   competitiveness   pressures   expo se   the   economy's    sensitivity    to    changes    in     the    global    economic     environment,   especially   to    trends   in   international    activity  (notably  sector-specific  developments)  and   the  euro/dollar  ex change  rate.  On  the  domestic  side,   the   extended   residential   co nstruction   boom   and    accelerating house prices, coupled with the significant  increases  in  household  indebtedness,  are  noteworthy   risks to the economy over the medium term.  Labour market, costs and prices  Labour  market  performance  was  extremely  robust  in   2005,  with  employment  est imated  to  have  grown  by   4¾% on the year. In line with the strong performance  of the services sector, partly offset by some easing in  construction    output,    employment    gains    will    be     somewhat weaker but still remain  very robust over the  forecast  horizon.  Labour  force  growth,  fuelled  by   significant    inward    migrat ion    (notably    from    the     recently  acceded  EU  Member  States)  and  increased   participation,   is   projected   to    keep   pace   with   the    upward employment trend. The unemployment rate is  thus  estimated  to  remain  under  4½%  in  2006  and   2007.   In   the   light   of   a   lower   contribution   from    benchmarking pay awards to  public sector employees  (i.e. the alignment of public  sector wages with private  sector  equivalents),  despite  the  relatively  tight  labour   market    conditions,    the     growth    in    per    capita     compensation  is  estimated  to   fall  below  5%  over  the   forecast  period.  HICP  inflation  picked  up  somewhat  in  the  first  quarter  of  2006,  partly  reflecting  adverse   energy  developments.  The  annual  rate  is  nevertheless   expected  to  moderate  in  the  second  half  of  2006  due   to a base effect, before rising sli ghtly again into 2007  in    line    with    the    projected     pick-up    in    private     consumption.  CPI  inflati on  is  expected  to  be  above   that of HICP over the forecast period, in line with the  expected increase of average mortgage repayments.  Public finances      In  2005  the  general  government  balance  is  estimated   to   have   been   in   surp lus  by  1.0%  of  GDP.  This   favourable   outturn   is   mainly   due   to   higher-than- expected   tax   receipts   and   partly   to   lower-than- budgeted  expend itures,  especially  on  capital  outlays.   As regards the budget for 2006, the main measures on  the revenue side include an upward adjustment of the  standard  tax  band  for  personal  income  and  some   further relief through an in crease in the employee tax  credit.  On  the  expenditure  side,  the  social  welfare   package  is  somewhat  more  generous  than  in  2005.  A   significant rise in capital spending is also foreseen for  2006     and     2007,     focusing     in     particular     on      improvements  in  tran sport  infrastructure.  The  public   finances   are   expected   to   remain   strong,   with   the    general  government  balance  forecast  to  post  a  small   surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 20 06 before turning into a  deficit   of   0.4%   of   GDP    in   2007.   However,   the    macroeconomic risks, if realised,  have the potential to  push  the  public  finances  into  a  larger  deficit  than   forecast. Given the non-indexed nature of the tax and  social     benefit     systems,     the     no-policy-change      assumption   for   2007   is   made   operational,   in   the    absence   of   previously   announced   measures,   by    freezing average tax rates and adjusting social transfer  payments  by  the  forecast  CPI  inflation  rate  (with  a   small   top-up).   Government   debt   is   projected   to    stabilise  at  around  27%  of  GDP  over  the  forecast   period. 		
April/2006	Italy	Modest upturn, but still below the euro area performance 	Following   a   mild   recovery    in   2004,   real   GDP    stagnated  again  in  2005  as  it  did  in  2002  2003.  This   confirmed   the   structural   weakness   of   the   Italian    economy, in a period of global upswing.   Private  consumption  was  ve ry  weak  and  investment   contracted.  Persistent  difficulties  in  public  finances   may  have  affected  economic  actors'  confidence.  The   contribution of domestic demand to economic growth  was  marginally  positive  only  thanks  to  increasing   government  consumption.  On  the  external  side,  real   exports  continued  to  record  a   large  loss  of  market   shares  and  net  exports  acted  as  a  drag  on  GDP   growth.    Employment,  measured  in  full-time  equivalent  terms,   which  had  held  up  well  duri ng  the  previous  years  of   feeble  economic  growth,  decreased  in  2005,  for  the   first  time  since  1994.  However,  the  increase  in  head   count  employment  recorded  by  the  Labour  Force   Surveys  continued  to  be  surprisingly  solid,  mainly   reflecting immigrants' regularisation.    HICP inflation averaged  2.2%, in line with  that in the  euro area, although the impact of higher energy prices  was less pronounced.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Signs   of   an   improving    short-term   outlook   started    materialising only at the end of 2005, when industrial  production and orders rebounded after the unexpected  fall  recorded  in  early  autumn.  However,  this  did  not   prevent  a  flat  real  GDP  in  the  last  quarter  of  2005,   which  implies  a  weaker  carryov er  into  2006  than   assumed in the autumn 2005 forecasts. On the back of  improving    business    confidence    and    increasing     industrial   production,   real   GDP   is   expected   to    accelerate in the first part of 2006, with quarterly rises  slightly   above   potential.   On   an   annual   basis,   the    economy  is  projected  to   expand  by  1.3%  in  2006,   before decelerating slightly to 1.2% in 2007 due to the  impact of increasing oil prices.   Over   2006-2007,   the   recovery    is   expected   to   be    largely   driven   by   domest ic   demand,   while   the    contribution  to  economic   growth  from  net  exports  is   expected to be broadly neutral.   After the negative reading  at the end of 2005, private  consumption  is  projected  to  regain  steam  already  at   the  beginning  of  2006.  Underpinned  by  a  revival  of   job   creation   and   nominal   wages   growing   above    inflation, private consumption should expand by 1.0%  and   1.1%   in   2006   and   2007,   respectively.   The    households'  saving  rate  is   expected  to  remain  stable.   Public  consumption  is  projected  to  decelerate  due  to   the  effects  of  th e  2006  budget.  Incr eased  confidence   and  stronger  demand  prospect s  should  trigger  a  pick   up  in  investment,  which   should  also  be  supported  by   still  favourable  financial   conditions,  in  spite  of  rising   interest rate expectations. Companies will also benefit  from    the    reduction    in    the    employers'    social     contribution rate of up to 1% implemented in the 2006  budget.  Following  th e  fall  recorded  in   2005,  public   investment  is  expected  to  rebound.  Overall,  gross   fixed  capital  formation  is   expected  to  represent  the   most  dynamic  component  of  domestic  demand  and   should provide a positive contribution to GDP growth of ½% both in 2006 and in 2007.  Concerning  the  external  sec tor,  exports  are  set  to   accelerate in real terms. However, they will expand at  only  around  half  the  pace  assumed  in  corresponding   export   markets,   due   to    persistent   competitiveness    problems,  partly  related  to   structural  shortcomings   like the product specialisation  of the Italian economy.  After  the  high  elasticity  to  final   demand  recorded  in   2005,  imports  are  assumed  to  grow  in  line  with  their   long term elasticity over 2006 2007.    Labour market, costs and prices  The  projected  economic  uptur n  in  2006  and  2007   should   push   employment   up   again,   even   when    measured  in  full-time  equivalents.  Nevertheless,  the   labour  content  of  economic   growth  is  expected  to  be   lower  than  in  the  recent  past,  as  the  effects  of  labour   market  reforms  introduced  since  the  mid  1990s  seem   to   be   fading   away.   The   unemployment   rate   is    projected  to  remain  stable  at  7¾%  in  both  2006  and   2007.   On  the  back  of  more   favourable  cyclical  conditions,   but  still  constrained  by   low  specialisation  in  high   technology/growth   sector s,   labour   productivity   is    forecast  to  increase  by  1%  both  in  2006  and  2007,   approaching   rates   more   consi stent   with   historical    figures.  Higher  labour  pr oductivity  growth  together   with  the  projected  deceleration  of  wage  costs  in  the   private  sector,  which  should  also  be  curbed  by  the   reduction  in  social  contributions ,  should  result  in  a   slowdown  of  unit  labour  costs.  This  would    have  a   positive  impact  on  the  competitive  position  of  the   Italian     economy,     especially     vis-à-vis     non-EU      countries,  and  mitigate  some what  the  loss  of  market   shares in 2006 and 2007.   The more moderate unit labour costs growth will also  contribute  to  keeping  core  inflation  below  2%  over   2006-2007. However, on the back  of higher oil prices,  headline  HICP  inflation  is  expected  to  remain  above   2% in 2006 and to  fall to 2.0% in 2007.  Public finances  In  2005,  the  deficit   increased  to  4.1%  of  GDP,  up   from  3.4%  of  GDP  in  2004 1 .  The  primary  surplus   shrank to a meagre 0.5% of GDP, from 1.3% in 2004.  Interest  expenditure,  including  swap-related  savings,   dropped  by  around  0.2%  of  GDP.  The  budgetary   impact   of   one-offs   declined   to   around   ½   of   a    percentage  point  of  GDP,  from  about  1¼%  in  2004.   The  structural  balance,  i.e.  the  cyclically  adjusted   deficit excluding one-off measures, improved by more  than  ½%  of  GDP.  The  primary  structural  surplus   increased by nearly ½% of GDP.  In  2006,  the  general  government  deficit  is  forecast  to   remain stable at 4.1% of GDP. The impact of one-off  measures (sales of real estate and revenues from taxes  on  the  revaluations  of  corporations'  assets  and  tax   amnesties)  is  expected  to  diminish  further  to  ¼  of  a   percentage point of GDP.  Increased interest rates and  the  rising  government  debt   would  prevent  a  further   reduction  of  interest  expenditure,  which  is  projected   to remain broadly stable at around 4½ % of GDP. The  primary surplus would remain at around ½% of GDP.  Net    of    cyclical    factors    and    excluding    one-off     measures, both the deficit and the primary balance are  projected  to  improve  by  slightly  less  than  ¼  of  a   percentage  point  of  GDP,  thus  well  below  the  ¾   recommended  by  the  Council  in  its  recommendation   under Article 104(7).   The  4.1%  of  GDP  deficit  forecast  for  2006  contrasts   with the official projections in the  2005 update of the  stability  programme,  which   targeted  a  3.5%  of  GDP   deficit  this  year,  assuming  the  full  implementation  of   the   2006   and   previous   Budget   Laws.   However,    despite  the  better  than  exp ected  2005   deficit  outturn,   on  5  April,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance   revised the official deficit forecast upward, to 3.8% of  GDP, which mainly reflects expenditure overruns.  Given  the  record  of  regular  overruns,  confirmed  by   the new official forecast, the Commission services are  more   prudent   in   their   assessment   of   the   size   of    savings  foreseen  in  the   2006  Budget  Law  through   substantial  cuts  on  health  care  and  other  government   expenditure,    in    particu lar    of    local    government.     Moreover,   in   accordance   with   the   new   official    forecast of 5 April, the lack of implementation of the  measures    on    public    employment    envisaged    in     previous budgets would lead to higher expenditure for  compensation  of  employees.  On  the  revenue  side,   Commission projections are overall in  line with those  in  the  Budget  Law,   except  for  the   additional  revenue   to be realised by regions having a structural deficit in  health  care  accounts,  as  the  procedures  necessary  to   trigger    this    increase    have    not    yet    been    fully     implemented.   Concerning   the   risks   linked   to   the   Commission    projections for public finance, the new mechanisms to  enforce the ambitious expenditure cuts foreseen in the  2006 budget might tu rn out to be more effective than  assumed. However, the Commission services forecast  already incorporates a sizeable share of such savings,  which   might   prove   challenging   to   achieve.   In    addition,  the  large  cuts   in  transfers  to  State-owned   railways and road maintenance companies planned in  the  Budget  Law  might  be  difficult  to  sustain  given   their  current  financial  need s.  Finally,  the  new  tax   agreement with self-employed professionals and small  firms still needs to be put in place. The forecast for a  2007   deficit   of   4.5%   of   GDP   is   based   on   the    customary   no   policy   chan ge   scenario   and   mainly    reflects  higher  interest  expenditure  and  no  one-off   measures. In  2005,  the  government  debt  ratio  increased  for  the   first  time  in  ten  years,  to   attain  106½%  of  GDP,  up   from  103¾%  in  2004.  This  was  the  result  of  the   combined   effect   of   stag nation   and   the   very   low    primary       surplus.       Debt -increasing       financial        transactions  amounted  to  around  1¼%  of  GDP,  of   which ½% of investment in liquid assets. Privatisation  receipts dropped to 0.3% of GDP in 2005, from 0.6%  in 2004.   The  government  debt  ratio  is  forecast  to  increase   again  in  2006  by  around  1%  of  GDP.  This  forecast   incorporates  the  high  cash  borrowing  requirement   estimated  in  the  new  official  forecast  released  on  5   April and includes privatisati on receipts amounting to  around ¾ of a percentage point  of GDP as planned in  the   2005   stability   programme.    Based   on   the   no- policy-change scenario and the stock-flow adjustment  planned in the 2005 stab ility programme, the debt-to- GDP ratio should further increase by ¼% in 2007. 		
April/2006	Cyprus	On the road to fiscal consolidation 	Despite  posting  a  slight  deceleration  compared  with   2004,  real  GDP  growth  in  Cyprus  remained  buoyant   last  year  at  3.8%.  This  seems   to  confirm  that  the   Cypriot   economy   has   rec overed   the   strength   it    enjoyed  prior  to  the  deceleration  cycle  in  2002-2003,   in  spite  of  the  recent  oil  price  hike,  which  does  not   seem  to  have  had  a  significant  impact  on  activity.   Growth   was   mainly   driven   by   domestic   demand,    which  contributed  3¾  percentage  points.  Compared   with    the    previous    year,     private    consumption     decelerated  significantly,  after  a  surge  recorded  in   2004 associated with one-off factors (reduction in car  excise),  but  still  attain ed  a  healthy  growth  of  4¾%.   Despite  the  ongoing  consolid ation of public finances,  public  consumption  showed  a  marginal  but  positive   real growth of ½%, whereas it  had contracted in 2004.  The     strong     deceleration     recorded     by     public      infrastructure expenditure, wh ich  contracted  by  about   13.5%, was not fully compensat ed by buoyant private  investment    in    constru ction.    As    a    result,    total     investment  growth  in  real  terms  recorded  a  sharp   slowdown,  to  just  above   2½%  (10%  in  2004).    The   contribution  to  GDP  growth  of  net  exports  was  still   negative  ( ѿ   of  a  percentage  po int),  although  much   less so than in  2004 when it dragg ed growth down by  3½ points. Despite the relativ ely poor performance of  tourism   revenue,   which   led   to   a   deceleration   of    exports,  the  reduction  in  the   negative  contribution  of   the  net  exports  was  actually  driven  by  the  sharp   slowdown  recorded  by  im ports,  partially  caused  by   decelerating   domestic   demand.   As   a   result,   the    external  account  deficit  increased  only  marginally,  to   about 5¾% of GDP.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Cyprus'  economy  is  projected  to  continue  growing   solidly     at     3.8%     over     the     forecast     horizon.      Consequently, the output gap is set to almost close by  2007,  while  it  was  in  neg ative  territory  since  2003.   Growth  is  expected  to  be  mainly  driven  by  domestic   demand.  Private  consumption  growth  is  foreseen  to   remain on a declining path  slightly above 4% in 2006,  but  3½%  in  2007.  Th is  is  the  result  of  a  more   moderate  wage  growth,  and   the  fading-out  of  tax   reforms introduced in 2004 , in particular excise duties  on  cars,  that  boosted  priva te  consumption  growth  to   unusually    high    levels.    Pu blic    consumption    is     projected  to  rebound  in   real  terms  to  nearly  2%  in   2006.  Investment  should  recover,  and  grow  by  about   5%   per   year   over   the   forecasting   horizon.   This    expansion of investment in 2006 should be mainly led  by  construction,  in  par ticular  housing,  on  account   partly  of  a  strong  demand  for  dwellings  by  non- residents.  In  2007,  although   rising  prices  should  ease   demand   pressures   in   the   housing   market,   higher    investment  in  machinery  and  equipment,  driven  by   confidence  effects  in  the  process  of  joining  the  euro   area, should sustain investment.  The external sector is projected to be broadly growth- neutral  until  the  end  of  th e  forecast  period.  Imports   are expected to rebound to growth rates of above 6%,  which  is  not  only  more  con sistent  with  past  trends  in   import penetration than those recorded last year, but is  also   the   result   of   the   much   higher   investment    projected,   particularly   in   equipment.   Based   on   a    stronger  growth  outlook  for  the  EU  and  other  main   trading  partners,  export  growth  should  also  recover.   Specifically,  exports  of  goods  should  increase  by   above  6½%  in  both  years,   mainly  driven  by  buoyant   re-export  activity.  In  parallel,  the  improvement  of   prospects in the tourism sector should give a boost to  services.  The  external  account  deficit  is  projected  to   remain  broadly  constant  above  5½%  of  GDP  for  the   forecast period.   Labour market, costs and prices  Consistent  with  sustaine d  GDP  growth,  employment   is projected to keep growing at around 1½% per year  until  2007.  As  a  result,  unempl oyment  is  expected  to   remain   around   its   current   levels   for   the   forecast    period.   Although   labou r   market   conditions   will   remain  tight,  increasing  share  of  foreign  workers,   combined  with  moderate  wag e  growth  in  the  public   sector,   should   ease   wage   pressure.   Wage   growth    should  moderate  to  3½%.  Since  productivity  growth   is  expected  to  rise  to  slightly   above  2½%  by  2007,   unit labour costs will keep  on rising, but at lower rates  than  in  the  recent  past.  Buoyant  domestic  demand,   healthy   wage   growth   and   rising   oil   prices,   are    expected  to  lead   inflation  to  2.4%  in   2006,  and  to   2.2%  by  2007.  Mone tary  conditions   appear  stable,   although  slightly  restrictive,  which   is  helping  to  keep   inflation  under  contro l,  while  the  ex change  rate  with   the Euro remains broadly constant.   Public finances  The  government  deficit  in  2005  was  2.4%  of  GDP;   this  outcome  represents  an  improvement  of  around   1¾%   of   GDP   compared   with   2004.   This   deficit    reduction   is   attributed   to    the   better-than-expected    impact  of  the  tax  amnesty  and  the  effect  of  other   structural    consolidation    measu res,    on    both    the     expenditure and the revenue sides. Indirect taxes were  supported   by   the   growth   composition,   especially    private  consumption.  One-off  revenues,  mainly  from   the  tax  amnesty,  amounted  to  almost  1%  of  GDP,  a   similar   figure   to   that   of    2004.   As   a   result,   the    structural deficit is estimated to have improved by 2%  of GDP, from about 5% in 2004 to 3% last year. The  2006  deficit  is  projected  above  2%  of  GDP,  slightly   higher  than  the  official  targ et,  and  at  around  2¼%  in   structural terms. The adjustment  projected for 2006 is  based    on    structural    cuts    in    current    primary     expenditure,  savings  on  interest  expenditure  and  a   combination   of   structural   and   one-off   measures    (amounting  to  ¼%  of  GDP)  on  the  revenue  side.  In   2007,    the    customary    no-policy-change    scenario     projects   a   deficit   of   2%   of   GDP.   The   general    government debt is projected to continue the declining  path initiated in 2004 and to reach 67¾% in 2007. 		
April/2006	Latvia	Growth fuelling external imbalances and inflation 	According to preliminary national accounts, real GDP  growth  reached  an  all-time  high,  registering  a  10.2%   annual  growth  rate  which  pu shed  output  even  further   above  potential.  Virtually  every  sector  experienced   growth.  Domestic  demand  growth  remained  high  and   external   demand   accelerated.   Consumer   demand,    fuelled    by    better    credit    access    and    significant     increases  in  real  disposable  income,  continued  to   expand at a steady rate. Retail sales growth exceeded  20% throughout the year; sales  grew most strongly in  the   non-food   sector   with   buoyant   spending   on    durables    correlating    with    a    real    estate    boom.     Investment  grew  at  a  very   fast  rate,  reflecting  strong   demand for equipment and c ontinued buoyancy in the  construction  sector.  Export   performance  in  2005  was   particularly  robust.  Export  values  grew  by  more  than   30%, outpacing imports, which grew by around 25%;  in  real  terms,  the  respective  growth  rates  were  21%   and  13%.  Even  though  the  external  deficit  remained   very  large,  the  external  gr owth  contributio n  turned   positive for the first  time since 2000.  The economy’s momentum is  supported by significant  EU      funds-related      activity,      increased      labour       participation and declinin g unemployment.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Growth  prospects  for  2006-2007  are  strong,  with  an   expected  expansion  of  about  8½%  in  2006  and  7½%   in  2007.  Given  the  alread y  wide  positive  estimated   output gap, there is a non-neglig ible risk to sustaining  growth  at  such  a  rapid  rate.   Since  strong  investment   expansion  is  the  main  contributor  to  the  increase  in   estimated  potential,  the  fo recast  is  predicated  on  the   quality  of  investment  being  adequate  in  terms  of   enabling real productivity gains.  If the investment mix  were    inappropriate    there     would    be    significant     downward  risks  to  the  sustai nability  of  expansion  at   the  rates  foreseen,  with  potential  labour  problems   (shortage and high cost level) adding to the risk.  Expansion  of  final  domestic   demand  is  expected  to   continue  to  drive  overall  growth,  primarily  led  by   investment,   with   hou sing   construction   increasing    strongly.  Private  consumption  is  also  expected  to   remain    strong,    largely    because    of    employment     growth,  substantially  higher  real  wages  and  better   credit access. The external contribution will again turn  negative.   While   the   high   levels   of   investment   in    equipment   and   production   facilities   will   underpin    export growth, the relatively  high base level and some  short-term saturation of fo reign markets will moderate  export  expansion  to  rates  below  those  achieved  in   2005.  Import  growth  is  expected  to  remain  robust,   only slightly down on 200 5, partly due to the increase  in   investment   and   inputs    for   intermediate   goods.    Thus,   the   current   account   deficit   will   remain   at    roughly the same ratio to GDP throughout the forecast  period.  Labour market, costs and prices  High     growth     has     contributed     to     reducing      unemployment and boosting em ployment. In line with  the  projected  expansion  of  construction  output  and   strong performance of the  service sector, employment  gains are expected to rema in robust in 2006 and 2007  while  annual  productivity  growth  will  remain  of  the   order  of  7-8%.  Labour  for ce  growth,  after  taking   account  of  significant  outward  migration  (chiefly  to   the old EU Member States) and negative demographic  trends,  is  projected  to  remain   negligible,  though  the   activity      rate      should       rise      somewhat.      The       unemployment  rate  is  estimated  to  decrease  steadily.   Per  capita  compensation  will  continue  to  increase   strongly.  Throughout  2005  a  sharp  pi ck-up  in  inflation  was   reflected  in  all  indices,  with  that  for  producer  prices   outpacing      consumer      prices.      Several      factors       contributed, food prices the mo st, followed by energy  and administered prices. The main risk to the inflation  outlook is that price increases could become persistent  if  strong  demand  continues  to  drive  output  further   above  potential  and  feeds   into  inflation  expectations.  Taking this into account, the current prospects are for  HICP  inflation  for  2006  of  around  6½%,  and  only   modestly lower in 2007.  Public finances  Generally,  owing  to  the  strong  growth,  fiscal  targets   have  been  met  or  even  exceeded.  The  budget  results   for  2005  were  significantly   better  than  expected  and   the  resulting  general  governmen t  surplus  of  0.2%  of   GDP was surprising , not least in light of a cash-based  estimate  of  a  deficit  of  1%   of  GDP  (the  difference   stemming  mostly  from  the  cash-accrual  adjustment   for  EU  funds).  The  deficit  is  expected  to  remain  at   around  1%  of  GDP  in  2006 -2007  (well  within  the   official  targets  of  1½%),  though  for  2006  this  is   predicted  upon  no  mid-year  budget  re-opening  to   increase expenditure as has been common in previous  years.  Government  debt  is   projected  to  drop  just   below 11% of GDP at the end of the forecast period. 		
April/2006	Lithuania	Strong growth and a tightening labour market 	GDP  growth  is  estimated  to  have  reached  7.5%  in   2005,   exceeding   the   autumn   forecast   by   half   a    percentage  point  and  supp orted  mainly  by  domestic   demand. Household consump tion remained very firm,  on  the  back  of  a  rapid  expansion  of  bank  credit,   increasing  employment  and   strong  wage  growth.  A   slowdown  of  investment  activity  in  the  first  half  of   2005  proved  tempor ary.  In  the  year  as  a  whole,   investment  grew  at  double-di git  rates  for  the  fifth   consecutive  year.  Exports  regained  momentum  after   two  years  of  relatively  low  gro wth  and  led  to  a   considerably lower drag on gro wth from net trade.  Prospects in 2006 and 2007  The  outlook  for  growth  in  2006  and  2007  remains   favourable.  GDP  growth  is   projected  to  gradually   slow   down   but   to   remain   robust   at   above   6%.    Domestic  demand  is  expected  to  remain  the  main   driver,  though  contributing  m ore  moderately  than  in   2005.  Investment  activity  is  forecast   to  remain  buoyant,   aided    by    EU    funds    and    favourable    financial     conditions,   as   real   interest    rates   are   expected   to    remain low. Disposable income growth is expected to  increase,  on  the  back  of  rapid  wage  growth  and  the   reduction  of  the  personal  inco me  tax  in  July  2006.   This,  together  with  high  bank  credit  growth,  is  likely   to continue to stimulate high consumption.  The  outlook  for  exports   is  benign,  reflecting  positive   prospects  for  Lithuania's  ma jor  trading  partners.  The   outlook for international trade  remains favourable and  strong demand from Russia and other CIS countries is  expected to persist. It is also  assumed that Lithuania’s  export capacity will improve due to the high increase  of investment in previous years.  Import  growth  is  forecast  to  remain  robust,  on  the   back  of  buoyant  private  co nsumption  and  investment   activity.  The  contribution  of  net  trade  to  growth  is   expected  to  remain  negative,  though  less  than  in   previous  years.  As  in  the  last  two  years,  a  projected   improvement in the terms of trade is likely to contain  the   trade   deficit.   The   current   account   deficit   is    expected  to  increase  to  some  7.4%  of  GDP  by  2007,   while   Lithuania’s   net   borrowing   position   in   the    balance  of  payments  will  be  less  negative  due  to  the   positive impact of increasing EU capital transfers.  Labour market, costs and prices  The labour market ti ghtened in 2005.  The labour force  declined,   which   partly   reflects   emigration   flows,    while  the  imbalance  between  supply  and  demand  in   several   sectors   persisted   and   may   have   created    upward   pressures   on   labour   costs.   Employment    growth  picked  up  strongly,  while  the  unemployment   rate   declined   markedly,   to    about   8%.   Structural    unemployment     remains     high,     with     long-term      unemployment significantly above the EU average.  Looking  forward,  employment   growth  is  anticipated   to  remain  positive  over  the  forecast  period,  although   lower  than  in  2005.  Unempl oyment  is  anticipated  to   decrease  below  7%  towards  the  end  of  2007.  The   labour market is likely to tighten further and nominal  wage     growth     is     expected     to     remain     high.      Nevertheless, the decrease in the personal income tax  rate in July 2006, from 33% to 27% could slow down  wage  growth  relative  to  2005 ,  reducing  the  gap  with   productivity  growth  and  to  some  extent  moderating   the impact on unit labour costs.  Annual  average  HICP  inflation  increased  to  2.7%  in   2005,  mostly  reflecting  rising  energy,  health  care,   transport  and  food  prices.  HICP   inflation  in  the  first   quarter  of  2006  was  on  average  3.3%.  The  inflation   outlook  for  2006-2007  has  been  revised  upwards   compared to the autumn forecast. From January 2006,  Lithuania’s  single  gas  su pplier  (Gazprom)  increased   wholesale  gas  prices  by  some  40%.  This  was  not   included  in  the  headline  projection  in  autumn,  and   was  only  considered  an   upward  risk.  Central  heating   prices,   which   are   regulated,    have   not   been   fully   adjusted  yet  and  thus  the  main  impact  on  consumer   prices  is  expected  in  the  second  half  of  the  year.   Additional  upward  pressure   on  prices  in  2006  may   come from the external environment, as import prices  are  assumed  to  remain  high  and  a  slight  depreciation   of  the  litas  against  the   US  dollar  is  anticipated.  High   wage  growth  is  forecast  to  continue  and  expected  to   put   pressure   on   unit   labou r   costs.   Against   this    background,   annual   average   inflation   in   2006   is    projected  to  edge  up  to   3.5%.  In  2007,  inflation  is   expected  to  decline  slightly  but  remain  above  3%.  A   significantly  lower  increase  in  import  prices  is  likely   to  ease  pressures  on  inflation,  while  the  impact  of   higher gas prices is expected to  be an offsetting factor.  The   evolution   of   oil   prices   and   their   impact   on    inflation, together with a reacti on of wages and prices  to   demand   growth,   are   the   main   risks   for   the    projections.   Excise   duty   adjustments   foreseen   in    Lithuania's    accession    treaty    may    also    lead    to     significantly higher in flation than projected.  Public finances  The  general  government  deficit  decreased  to  0.5%  of   GDP in 2005, well below the initial government target  and  the  Commission  services’  autumn  forecast.  The   more   favourable   outcome   st ems   from   a   virtuous    budgetary   execution   at   al l   levels   of   government,    which  recorded  higher-tha n-planned  revenues  while   expenditure  plans  were  broadly  achieved.  Assuming   that   the   budget   will   be   strictly   implemented,   the    deficit  is  forecast  to  remain   rather  stable  in  2006  on   the  back  of  strong  revenue  growth  and  improved  tax   collection.  The  impact  of  the  tax  reform,  which  is   included in the budget for  2006, is likely to be broadly  neutral  in  2006  but  negative  in  2007  which,  together   with  the  increasing   costs  of  the  pension  reform  and   other  expenditure,  is  expected  to  raise  the  deficit  to   close to 1% of GDP. The general government debt is  anticipated  to  remain  low  at  close  to  19%  of  GDP  in   the forecast period. 		
April/2006	Luxembourg	Healthy growth, concerns about unemployment and public finances 	The  Luxembourg  economy  performed  rather  well  in   2005:  real  GDP  growth  probably  reached  between  4   and  4½%,  about  the  same   rate  as  in  2004,  which  is,   however,  below  the  average  of  the  last  10  years   (5.2%).    Growth  in  2005  was  chiefly  supported  by   external  trade  in  services,  the  exports  and  imports  of   which both rose by more  than 10% in real terms : the  activity  in  the  fin ancial  sector  was  buoyant  thanks  to   the  good  health  of  financi al  markets  and  tourism   benefited from the Luxembourg presidency of the EU  in the first half of the year. On  the other hand, like in  2004,  domestic  demand  was  rather  subdued  in  2005,   with   private   consumption   only   growing   by   about    1½% : although unemployment remains relatively low  by  EU  standards,  it  has  considerably  risen  in  recent   years,  which  probably  explains  the  deterioration  in   consumer   confidence   all   along   the   year   2005.    Moreover,      as      non-resident      workers,      whose       consumption  in  Luxembourg  is  smaller  than  that  of   residents,  accounted  for  about  two-thirds  of  domestic   employment growth in recent years, a large and rising  part  of  the  increase  in  the  wage  bill  is  spent  abroad.   As a result, retail trade stagnated, even if a significant  improvement  was  visible  in  the  second  half  of  the   year.  Similarly,  activity  in  the   construction  sector   decreased   due   to   the   weakness   of   investment   by    enterprises  and  the  govern ment  but  some  signs  of   recovery  could  be  observed  towards  the  end  of  the   year.    In  total,  gross  fixed   capital  formation  hardly   grew   by   more   than   2%.   On   the   other   hand,    government   consumption   was    buoyant,   rising   by    nearly 7% in real terms.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  GDP    growth    is    expected    to    remain    in    the     neighbourhood   of   4½%   in   2006   and   2007.   The    external  sector  will  probably   be  less  supportive  than   in  2005:  exports  of  goods  are  projected  to  accelerate   in  2006  in  line  with   the  strengthening   of  exports   market   growth   but   exports   of   services,   though    remaining vigorous, could slow down somewhat after  the  strong  growth  recorded  in  2005.  On  the  other   hand, domestic demand should be more dynamic than  in   recent   years.   Despite   the   projected   rise   in    unemployment,       private       consumption       should        accelerate  somewhat  thanks  to  non  negligible  wage   increases   and   a   projected   acceleration   in   resident    employment.   Similarly,   i nvestment   by   enterprises,    which  has  been  rather  subdued  in  2004  and  2005,   should  also  accelerate.  The  more  dynamic  domestic   demand should also lead to an acceleration in imports,  at  least  in  2006,  which  expl ains  in  part  why  external   trade is expected to be less supportive.  Labour market, costs and prices   Reflecting  the  strong  growt h  in  output,  employment   rose  by  about  3%  in  2005.  However,  unemployment   kept  rising,  reaching  5.3%,   so  that  the  Grand-Duchy   no  longer  has  the  lowest  un employment  rate  in  the   EU.  Once  again,  job  creation  mostly  benefited  non- residents, whose number rose by more than 5% while  resident  employment  on ly  increased  by  about  1½%.   This    discrepancy    certainly    reflects    mismatches     between the skills (or absence  thereof) of unemployed  residents and those required by  the jobs created but it  might  also  be  the  result  of  a  significantly  higher   reservation wage related to the  generosity of the social  security  system  (unemployment  benefits  are  nearly   twice  as  high  in  Luxembourg  as  in  neighbouring   countries).  Due  to  this  bi as  of  job  creation  towards   non-residents, employment may  have to rise by about  3½%    a    year    for    unemp loyment    to    stabilise.     Employment growth is projected to accelerate slightly  over  the  forecast  period  but  probably  not  enough  to   prevent unemployment from con tinuing to rise, albeit  at  a  gradually  slower  pace.  Like  in  recent  years,  the   rise   in   domestic   employment    should   considerably    outpace that in resident employment.  Inflation  considerably  accelerated  in  the  course  of   2005, mostly as a result of  the surge in oil prices. The  HICP increased by 3.8%, while  the rise in the national  CPI,  which  excludes  consumption  by  non-residents  and   especially   their   large   purchases   of   car   fuel,    alcohol   and   tobacco   products,   reached   2.5%   (the    weight  of  these  three  items  amounts  to  22.2%  in  the   HICP compared to 7.5% in the  national index). Due to  still  rising  projected  oil   prices,  both  indexes  should   post   in   2006   even    higher   increases   than   those    recorded in 2005, before decelerating in 2007.  Public finances  After  record  surpluses  in  2000  and  2001  (more  than   6%  of  GDP  in  both  years),  government  finances   rapidly deteriorated, recording in 2004 a 1.1% of GDP  deficit,  which  rose  to  1.9%   in  2005.  Despite  a  large   shortfall  in  VAT  revenues,  due   in  part  to  the  relative   weakness  in  private  consumption  but  above  all  to   large   and   unexpected   VAT   reimbursements,   total    government   resources   rose   by   6.2%   and   by   0.2    percentage  point  of  GDP,  than ks  chiefly  to  buoyant   revenues  from  direct  taxes,  especially  the  corporate   tax.       However,       simult aneously,       government        expenditure   rose   by   more   than   8%   and   by   1    percentage   point   of   GDP.   This   fast   increase   in    expenditure    was    mostly    imputable    to    public     investment     (+14.1%)     but     also     to     collective      consumption  (+12.3%).  In  2006,  the  rise  in  revenues   is   projected   to   accelerate   and   the   increase   in    expenditure  to  slow  down  somewhat,  as  government   consumption   and   investment   are   unlikely   to   post    again  the  very  high  growth  rates  recorded  in  2005.   Consequently,  the  deficit  sh ould  slightly  improve  to   about  1¾%  of  GDP.    In  2 007,  it  is  expected  to   contract  further  to  about  1½%  of  GDP:  the  rise  in   expenditure is assumed to be  similar to that projected  for  2006,  while  additiona l  revenues  will  result  from   tax   and   contribution   in creases,   announced   by   the    government  on  April  21.  Additional  consolidation   measures,  more  specifically  targeted  at  curbing  the   rise  in  spending,  were  due  to  be  announced  at  the   beginning  of  May,  but  their  content  was  not  known   before this forecast was finalised. 		
April/2006	Hungary	Solid growth overshadowed by twin deficit 	After  a  moderate  acceleration  in  2004,  real  GDP   decelerated slightly to 4.1% in 2005. The main driver  of    GDP    growth    was    the    exceptionally    strong     performance    in    net     exports.    Growth    in    the     manufacturing  sector  was  particularly  robust  in  the   production  of  electrical  and   optical  equipment  and  of   transport  equipment.  Most  of  the  increase  in  gross   fixed  capital  formation  was  realised  in  the  area  of   public infrastructure invest ment. Private consumption  was  relatively  moderate  compared   to  the  previous   years. Consumer  price  inflation  (H ICP)  declined  sharply  to   3.5% in the year as a whole, down from 6.8% in 2004.  Against the background of  falling inflation, the central  bank cut its policy rates by 350 basis points during the  course  of  2005.  The  unemp loyment  rate  hit  a  seven- year  high  of  7.5%  in  the  three  months  to  January   2006.   The current account deficit decreased to 7.3% of GDP  in   2005,   down   from   over   8.5%   of   GDP   in   the    previous  years  due  to  the  narrowing  gap  in  the  trade   balance.  However,  the  surprisingly  low  trade  deficit   could  be  linked  to  an  underestimation  of  imports  as   suggested by the  corresponding sharp  rise in net errors  and omissions (close to 2.5% of GDP in 2005) in the  balance   of   payment   statistics.   The   deficit   was    increasingly financed by net  foreign direct investment  inflows.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  In  2006,  real  GDP  growth  is  forecast  to  accelerate  to   around  4.6%.  Domestic  demand  is  expected  to  fuel   economic activity mainly because of the expansionary  fiscal  stance.  Foreign  demand  is  also  expected  to   contribute  to  GDP  growth  in   line  with  the  pick-up  in   the  international  economic   activity.  In  2007,  GDP   growth is expected to ease somewhat to around 4.2%,  due mainly to moderating private consumption.  Throughout      the      projection      period,      private       consumption  is  anticipated  to  be  especially  strong,   supported   by   lower   indi rect   taxes,   rising   social    transfers and minimum wage increases. Investment in  construction  will  continue  to   benefit  from  extensive   motorway     construction,     while     investment     in      equipment will remain steady  both in 2006 and 2007.  Imports  are  set  to  rise  alongside  private  consumption   and   investment   spending.   As   exports   are   also    expected to grow relatively strongly both in 2006 and  2007,  the  negative  trade   balance  is  set  to  stabilize  at   around 2.5% of GDP.  Due  to  the  continuing  fi scal  expansion  and  robust   private  consumption,  the  current  account  deficit  is   projected  to  widen  throug hout  the  forecast  period,   reaching   close   to   8.5%   of   GDP.   The   increasing    amount  of  public  and  private  foreign  debt-related   interest    expenditure    will    continue    to    strongly     contribute to the expanding factor income deficit.   Labour market, costs and prices  Employment    is    expected    to    slightly    increase     throughout  the  forecast  period.  As  the  participation   rate  is  projected  to  rise,   the  anticipated  employment   growth   might   not   translate   into   a   decline   in   the    unemployment  rate,  which   is  expected  to  stabilise  at   above 7½%.   Annual   consumer   price   inflation   is   projected   to    further  decelerate  to  about  2.3%  in  2006  as  a  whole,   mainly  as  a  result  of  the  cu t  in  VAT  rates.  The  first   monthly  data  for  2006  showe d  that  so  far  the  cut  in   the  VAT  only  partially  affected   prices.  However,  the   falling    inflation    expectations    and    the    intensive     competition   in   the   tradab le   sector   following   EU    accession  are  expected  to  cool  inflationary  pressures   in  2006.  In  2007,  fuelled  by   high  oil  prices  and  the   weakening forint, consumer price inflation is forecast  to  return  to  close  to  3.5% ,  broadly  in  line  with  the   underlying inflationary  trends in Hungary The  government  deficit  increased  to  6.1%  of  GDP  in   2005,  from  5.4%  in  2004 1 .  The  deficit  is  expected  to   further increase in 2006, reaching 6.7% of GDP 2 . The  forecast  includes  tax  cuts  of  over  1%  of  GDP  in  the   2006 budget (mainly the reduction of VAT rates and a  cut  in  the  top  rate  of  the  personal  income  tax).   Expenditures are projected to be higher than officially  estimated, as the budget lacks the necessary structural  reforms   targeting   expend iture   reduction.   Interest    expenditure   is   also   expected   to   be   higher   than    budgeted in view of the projected rise in interest rates  and the government debt level. Based on the usual no- policy  change  assumption,   the  budgetary  position  is   expected  to  worsen  in  2007  to  7%  of  GDP,  chiefly   due to the second step of the planned tax cuts.   The  forecast  includes  the  costs  of  military  aircraft   (0.3%  of  GDP  in  2006,  and   0.2%  of  GDP  in  2007)   purchased  under  a  financial   lease  and  to  be  delivered   in those two years (these  outlays were not included in  the  original  official  targets  of   4.7%  of  GDP  in  2006   and   of   3.3%   of   GDP   in   2007).   It   assumes   that    investment  in  new  motorways  built  in  public-private   partnerships worth about 1% of GDP, are recorded as  private     investment     and     not     as     government      expenditure 3 . In  the  light  of  increasing   yearly  deficit  levels,  the   debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  expected  to  exceed  the  60%   threshold in 2007. 		
April/2006	Malta	Mixed signs of a possible recovery 	Following  a  contraction  of  1½%  in  2004,  real  GDP   growth turned positive to  2½% in 2005. The rebound  of economic activity was driven by domestic demand,  especially inventories. Growth in private consumption  stood    close    to    1½%,    mainly    reflecting    higher     household  spending  on  services.  Gross  fixed  capital   formation  expanded  by  above  6%,  largely  due  to   public  spending  on  th e  Mater  Dei  Hospital  and  other   infrastructure    works    financed    through    the    EU     Structural  Funds  and  the  Italian  Protocol 1 .  However,   reflecting   ongoing   efforts   to    rein   in   the   fiscal    imbalance, public consumption  contracted by close to  2%.   Overall,   the   contribution   of   final   domestic    demand   to   GDP   growth   amounted   to   about   1¾    percentage  points.  In  addition ,  changes  in  inventories   contributed  4½  percentage  points  to  growth,  possibly   reflecting   anticipated   production   to   meet   orders    booked for 2006.  After   posting   modest   gr owth   in    2004,   exports    contracted   significantly   by   close   to   4%   in   2005,    mainly owing to a poor pe rformance of exports by the  electronics  sector.  Although  decelerating  to  below   ¼%,  import  growth  was  positive.  Accordingly,  the   negative  contribution  of  the  external  sector  to  GDP   growth amounted to 4 percentage points.  Employment  growth  decelerated,  reflecting  a  decline   in  public  sector  employment   which  partly  offset  the   increase   in   private   sector   jobs.   HICP   inflation    decelerated  to  2.5%  in  2005  reflecting  a  favourable   base effect caused by a rise in the standard VAT rate  and an upward adjustment in  energy products in 2004.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Real   GDP   growth   is   expected   to   slow   down    somewhat to 1¾% in 2006, and  accelerate to around  2%  in  2007.  Economic  activity  is  projected  to  be   almost  exclusively  domestically-d riven  in  both  years,   while  the  negative  contribution  of  the  external  sector   should  narrow  significantly.   Private  consumption  is   forecast   to   grow   by   around   1¼%   in   2006   and    accelerate to 1½% in 2007, on account of higher wage  growth,    while,    following    the    substantial    fiscal     consolidation  in  recent  years ,  public  consumption  is   projected to increase by around 1% in 2006 and 1½%  in  2007.  Investment  is  expe cted  to  remain  the  main   contributor  to  domestic  demand,  albeit  growing  at  a   slower  speed  than  in  2005  due  to  the  completion  of   some    public    infrastruc ture    projects.    Investment     growth is projected to ease in 200 7, when the decline  in public investment shou ld be partly compensated by  higher private investment.  Overall, the contribution of  domestic  demand  is  projected  to  attain  slightly  more   than 1¾ percentage points  in 2006  and 2007.  On   the   back   of   an   improved   outlook   for   the    electronics  sector  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  tourism   industry, exports are expected to recover in 2006 and  to  accelerate  further  in  2007.  As  a  result  of  higher   export growth and sustained consumption, imports are  also  expected  to  accelerate  over  the  forecast  period.   Net  exports  are  projected  to   detract  around  ¼  of  a   percentage point from GDP growth.  After  peaking  in  2005,   the  current  account  deficit  is   forecast  to  fall  to  around  12½%  of  GDP  in  2006  and   to  improve  further  in  2007.   This  outcome  is  mainly   explained by a reduction in the imbalance of primary  incomes and current transfers over the forecast period.  The  current  account  deficit  is  expected  to  be  only   partially  financed  by  cap ital  inflows  from  EU  funds.   The  remaining  net  external  borrowing  position  is   projected  to  remain  around  9%  of  GDP  over  the   forecast horizon.  Labour market, costs and prices  Employment growth is expected to decelerate in 2006  as the labour-intensive constr uction work related with  the  Mater  Dei  Hospital  ap proach  completion  stage.   Although  declines  in  constru ction  may  continue  in   2007,  job  creation  in  other  activities  is  expected  to   pick  up  owing  to  improved  prospects  mainly  in  the   private      sector.      With      the      restructuring      of      manufacturing  industry  almo st  completed,  job  losses   in   traditional   sectors   shou ld   bottom   out,   while    employment will be created by nascent sectors such as  pharmaceuticals.   However,   the   services   sector   is    expected    to    remain    th e    main    contributor    to     employment   growth,   due   to   further   expansion   in    information     technology      and     financial     services      activities.  Although  unemployme nt  is  anticipated  to   rise  to  7½%  in  2006,  it  sh ould  decline  marginally  in   2007.  The  outlook  for  HICP  inflation  shows  a  rise  to   almost 3% in 2006, both as the impact of the recently  introduced    market-b ased    utility    rates    are    fully     captured  by  the  index  and  as  a  result  of  expected   further increases in energy prices. Inflation in 2007 is  projected to decline only  marginally to around 2¾%.  Public finances  Fiscal  consolidation  procee ded  during  2005  as  the   deficit declined to 3.3% of GDP. In 2006, the general  government  deficit  is  expected  to  decline  further  to   below  3%  as  a  result  of  tax  buoyancy  mirroring  the   domestically-led  composition  of  growth  and  capital   transfers.  The  structural  deficit  (cyclically-adjusted   deficit net of one-offs) is expected to improve by less  than ¼% of GDP. Under a no-policy change scenario,  which   takes   into   accoun t  the  reduction  in  public   investment  linked  with  the  Mater  Dei  Hospital  but   excludes one-off revenue (sale of immovable property  estimated  at  ¾%  of  GDP),  the  deficit  is  forecast  to   stand    at    almost    3¼%    in    2007.    The    general     government  gross  debt  in  2005  declined  below  75%   of GDP. In 2006, the debt-t o-GDP ratio excluding the  effect  of  planned  privatisation  (estimated  at  7%  of   GDP),  is  expected  to  fall  to  74%.  Based  on  a  no- policy  change  scenario ,  the  debt  ratio  in  2007  is   projected  to  remain  unchanged  from  the  previous   year’s level. 		
April/2006	Netherlands	Economic growth back on track 	The hesitant recovery that had  started in 2004 did not  follow  through  in  2005 ,  with  GDP  growth  again   turning  out  lower,  at   1.1%.  The  quarterly  profile   shows that after a strongly negative first quarter, when  the  economy  contracted  by  a  hefty  0.7%  quarter-on- quarter, the recovery restarted with vigour as quarterly  growth   reached   0.9%   on   average   in   each   of   the    subsequent quarters.  Private    consumption,    after     stagnating    in    2004,     increased    by    a    modest    0.3%    in    2005.    With     households'   net   real   disposable   income   declining,    consumption  growth  was  held  up  only  by  the  fall  in   private  savings.  Private  gros s  fixed  investment  grew   by just over 3% and was dominated by investment in  construction.  Public  investment  was  down  2%  and   public  consumption  expend iture  increased  only  by   0.5%  as  fiscal  consolidation   continued.  All  in  all,   domestic demand added 0.7% to GDP growth.  Albeit    slightly    less    pronounced    than    in    2004,     economic  growth  was  still  predo minantly  driven  by   the external sector. Real exports of goods and services  grew  by  5.9%,  on  the  back  of  strong  world  trade   growth.  Imports  lagged  somewhat,  in  line  with  other   national    demand    factors.    In    all,    net    exports     contributed 0.9 of a percentage point to GDP growth.  The  strong  recovery  was  accompanied  by  a  large   depletion  of  stocks,  unlike  in  2004,  when  significant   stock   building   took   place.   This   swing   in   stock- building  resulted  in  a  negative  contribution  to  GDP   growth.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Economic  growth  is  expect ed  to  exceed  potential   growth by a significant margi n and post 2.6% in both  years  of  the  forecast  period.  Strong  world  import   growth continues to sup port exports, which are likely  to grow by around 6½% in 2006 and 2007. However,  import  growth  is  now  expected  to  fully  catch  up  and   show  similar  or  even  m arginally  higher  growth  rates.   The resulting net exports will add to GDP – around ¼  and   ¾   a   percentage   point   in   2006   and   2007,    respectively. The main gros s contribution to economic  growth   in   both   years   will   come   from   domestic    sources.    Private    investment    will    show    strong     momentum,  which  is  not  uncommon  at  this  phase  of   the  economic  cycle.  Corporate  gross  fixed  capital   formation  is  expected  to  increase  by  around  6%  in   2006  and  over  4%  in  2007,  although  the  figure  for   2006 is inflated by some  large investment projects.  The  reform  of  the  health  care  system  that  came  into   effect  at  the  beginning  of  20 06  resulted  in  a  shift  of   health   care   expenditures   fro m   private   to   public    consumption. Although this  leads to heavily distorted  growth  figures  of  private  and  public  consumption,  it   merely  represents  a  statistical  reclassification  and  no   large behavioural effects are assumed for the forecast  period. Government consumption, net of these effects,  is  expected  to  increase  relatively  modestly  in  2006,   but to pick up somewhat in th e first half of 2007 in the  run-up  to  the  general  elections.  Private  consumption   expenditure, also corrected for the health care reform,  is  forecast  to  grow  modestly   in  both  year s,  at  around   1½%  per  annum.  The  main  reason  for  the  relatively   benign   consumption   path   is    that   real   disposable    household income is expected to increase only slowly  as   wage   growth   will   lag   th e   economic   recovery.    Additionally,    private    savings    are    expected    to     recuperate  some  of  the  ground  lost  in  recent  years,   increasing  from  12.3%  in  2005  to  12.6%  of  gross   disposable income in 2006 and 2007.  Labour market, costs and prices  In  2005,  total  employment  is  expected  to  have  fallen   by  0.2%,  representing  the  th ird  consecutive  year  of   falling   employment.   The   economic   recovery   will    result  in  significant  employ ment  growth  from  2006   onwards,  leading  to  a  fall   in  unemployment  from   4.7%  in  2005  to  3.9%  in  2007.  Wage  growth  is   expected    to    remain    relativ ely    subdued,    mainly     because  tensions  in  the  labour  market  will  only  start  to arise at the end of the forecast period and wages are  likely  to  respond  with  a  lag   to  the  tightening  labour   market.   Unit   labour   costs   will   only   marginally    increase  in  2006,  but  pick  up  somewhat  in  2007.  As   the output gap is likely to  remain well within negative  territory,  inflationary  pressures  are  forecast  to  remain   contained.  HICP  inflation  is  expected  to  increase  to   1.8% 1   in  2006  and  2.1%  in   2007.  Oil  prices  are   assumed to continue to rise in 2006 and 2007, albeit at  a   slower   pace,   alleviating   upward   pressures   on    consumer prices.  Public finances  Since   the   deficit   peaked   in   2003,   the   general    government deficit was brought back to 1.9% in 2004  and   continued   to   decline   quickly   in   2005.   The    estimated deficit for 2005 has been heavily revised in  recent  months,  from  1.8%  last  September  at  the  time   of  the  budget  to  a  current  0.3%  of  GDP.  This  better- than-expected  outcome  reflects  higher  gas  receipts   and  tax  revenues,  as  well  as  spending  that  remained   below  the  allotted  ceilings.  Additionally,  the  balance   benefited  from  corporate  tax  receipts  of  ¼%  of  GDP   which   had   been   advanced    from   2006   to   2005    following   an   increase   in    interest   rates   paid   on    overpaid  taxes.  For  2006,   it  is  assumed  that  allotted   expenditure  ceilings  will  again   be  met  and  that  there   will  be  a  mirror  effect  of  the  advance  from  corporate   tax receipts. On balance, this will effectively increase  the budget deficit by 0.9 of a percentage point to 1.2%  of GDP against the backgrou nd of substantially higher  economic  growth.   In  2007,  the  deficit  is  expected  to   improve  to  ¾%  of  GDP  on  the  back  of  the  cyclical   upswing, but also because the expected increase in oil  prices  will  feed  through  to  gas  prices,  generating   additional revenues. 		
April/2006	Austria	Private consumption finally picking up slowly 	The   Austrian   economy   grew    by   1.9%   in   2005,    decelerating    from    2.4%    in    the    previous    year.     Domestic   and   external   demand   provided   roughly    equal     contributions     to      growth.     Against     the      background  of  sizeable  personal  income  tax  cuts,   private consumption grew at almost twice the pace of  the    previous    year,    tho ugh    still    moderately    by     historical  standards.  As   expected,  investment  grew   only slowly due to the expiry of the fiscal investment  premium  at  the  end  of   2004  (initially  planned  for  the   end  of  2003,  but  then  postponed)  which  resulted  in   significant   carry-forw ard   effects,   predominantly   in    2003.  After  the  strong  9%   growth  in   2004,  exports   decelerated  substantially,  but  this  was  mainly  due  to   statistical   effects   caused   by   the   change   in   the    treatment  of  accounting  of  aircraft  repairs.    With   imports   growing   very   slowly,   net   exports   still    contributed strongly  to growth.     Looking   at   the   quarterly   profile,   the   year   saw   a    gradual acceleration from 0.2% in the first quarter up  to  0.7%  in  the  last.  Both  private  and  government   consumption  grew  at  a  steady  pace  throughout  the   year,   whereas   gross   fixed   capital   formation   and    imports  growth  sped  up  quarter-on-quarter.  Export   growth   peaked   in   the   middle   of   the   year   and    weakened  thereafter,  reflecting  a  softening  of  exports   and imports in Germany.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Activity is expected to accelerate significantly in 2006  and  slow  down  somewhat  thereafter,  narrowing  the   negative  output  gap  over  the  forecast  period.  Growth   will  be  increasingly  driven  by  domestic  demand  as   consumers   benefit   from   previous   years'   tax   cuts,    lower-than-initially-expected  in flation  and  relatively   strong  job  creation.  The  growth  rate  of  equipment   investment  should  rebound  in  2006  on  the  back  of   rising   replacement   demand   and   healthy   profits.    Housing  construc tion  is  to  pick  up   after  a  slump  in   2005. Other construction is expected to grow robustly  due to the government's measures aimed at improving  Austria's  infrastructure,  adopted   mainly  to  address   growing unemployment.   Export   growth   in   2006   is   assumed   to   be   strong    because     of     carry-forward     effects     in     private      consumption  in  Germany  due  to  the  increase  in  the   standard   German   VAT   rate   as   from   2007.   The    planned  change  is  thought  to  influence  in  particular   purchases   of   durable   go ods,   which   constitute   a    significant share of Austrian exports to Germany.   Labour market, costs and prices  Employment   is   expected   to   grow   throughout   the    forecast  period,  albeit  more  slowly  than  in  the  euro   area  on  average,  due  to  continuously  higher  labour   productivity      in      Austria      (see      graph).      The       unemployment  rate  is  likely  to   remain  unchanged  up   to  the  forecast  horizon  as  the  labour  force  grows   rapidly  due  to  more  women  and  foreigners  entering   the  job  market  and  older  workers  staying  longer  as  a   consequence   of   the   recent   pension   reform.   The    government's  special  measures  adopted  in  September   2005  seem  to  be  helpi ng  to  stabilise  unemployment,   but are not sufficient to bring it down.   Consumer  price  inflation  is   projected  to  stay  well   below   2%   over   the   forecast   period.   Since   wage    developments   are   expected   to   stay   in   line   with    productivity  growth,  no  in flationary  pressures  should   arise from labour cost.  Public finances  In   2005,   the   general   government   budget   deficit    amounted to 1.5% of GDP, 0.4 percentage point lower  than  the  national  au thorities  had  initially  expected.   The  2005  budget  was  affected  by  the  second  stage  of   the  tax  reform  started  one  year  earlier.  Its  burden  on   the  budget  in  2005  had  been  estimated  at  0.8%  of   GDP,  but  tax  revenue  turned  out  to  be  higher  than   expected, mainly owing to higher proceeds from VAT  and  corporate  tax.  However,   the  planned  expenditure  was  also  exceeded  (e.g.  on  education  and  family   benefits), though by a smaller margin.   The  revenue  loss  from  the  tax  reform,  which  did  not   fully   materialize   in   2005,   will   most   probably   be    deferred to 2006 and enlarge  the revenue loss of about  1.4% of GDP initially estimated  for 2006.. The budget  will  be  additionally  burdened   with  the  cost  of  the   regional  employment  and  growth  initiative  of  August   2005  and  a  package  of  measures  aimed  at  combating   youth unemployment and he lping women re-enter the  job market that the gove rnment adopted in September  2005  (about  0.16 %  of  GDP  in  total).  On  the  other   hand,   implementation   of   the   second   stage   of   the    administrative   reform,   agreed   on   by   the   different    levels of government in November 2005, should result  in   expenditure   savings   of   around   0.1%   of   GDP.    Taking  all  those  factors  into  account,  it  is  likely  that   the  general  government   deficit  will  slightly  surpass   the 1.7% of GDP planned by the national authorities.   In  2007,  the  deficit  is  expected  to  decline  somewhat   as  the  impact  of  the  tax  reform  wears  off,  but  it  will   still   be   considerably   higher    than   the   0.8%   target    presented   in   the   latest   update   of   the   stability    programme.   The   debt   ratio   should    decrease   slightly   over   the    forecast  period,  but  will  nevertheless  remain  above   the 60%-of-GDP reference value. 		
April/2006	Poland	Expansion driven by domestic demand, no improvement in the fiscal  position 	At  3.2%,  GDP  growth  in  2 005  was  disappointing   compared  to  the  previous  year  (5.3%).  Economic   activity started to recover in  the final quarter of 2005,  when economic growth reached 4.2% year-on-year on  the  back  of  a  strong  pick-up  in  investment  activity.   Following the end of the pr e-election instability in the  first half of the year, when  investment growth reached  only   2.5%,   investors   regained   confidence   in   the    second  half.  In  2005  as  a  whole  gross  fixed  capital   formation  was  up  by  6.2%.  Total  domestic  demand   grew  by  a  meagre  1.9%  in  2005  because  of  low   consumption and large de-stocking.   Export  growth  almost  halved   to  7.1%  in  comparison   with 2004, and import growth slowed to a mere 3.4%,  down  from  15.2%  in  2004.  Overall,  GDP  growth  in   2005   was   supported   by   domestic   demand   net   of    changes  in  inventories  and  net   exports  (3.0  and  1.3   percentage   point   contributions   to   GDP   growth,    respectively). The contribution  of inventories to GDP  growth  was  negative  (-1.1  percentage  points).  Large   de-stocking  can  be  explained   by  the  adjustment  of   stocks  to  lower-than-expected   demand  and  too  high   demand expectations in 2004  (the year of accession to  the EU) when stocks were built up.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 4.5% in 2006  and 4.6% in 2007. Domestic demand is expected to be  the  main  driving  force  in   both  years.  Investment  and   private  consumption  growth  are  likely  to  pick  up   strongly  over  the  forecast  period.  This  outlook  is   underpinned  by  short-term  indi cators  which  point  to   industrial  production  and  retail  sales  reaching  over   10% year-on-year growth in the first quarter of 2006.  Despite     the     still     unstab le     political     situation,      companies  seem  to  be  mo re  inclined  to  invest,  which   is  reflected  in  high  investme nt-driven  import  growth.   Furthermore,  capacity  utilisat ion  is  very  high,  while   corporate  profits  in  2005  were  the  highest  in  the  last   16  years  and  interest  rates  are  at  a  record-low  level.   These   factors   are   expected   to   translate   into   high    investment growth in 2006 and 2007.   Private   consumption   is   likely   to   benefit   from   a    number of factors, notably the indexation of pensions  in 2006, the lowering of  effective personal income tax  rates  as  from  2007,  direct  payments  to  farmers  and   stronger    real    wage    growth.    The    administrative     difficulties  encountered   in  managing  EU  funds  have   so  far  limited  Poland’s  ab sorption  capacity,  but  the   situation  has  started  to  impr ove.  Therefore,  in  2006   and  2007,  EU  funds  (up  to  1.2%  and  1.5%  of  GDP,   respectively)    will    boost    domestic    demand    and     increase  imports,  which  will  tran slate  into  a  negative   contribution of net exports to  GDP growth, in spite of  a good performance of Polish exporters    Export  growth  accelerated  in  the  last  quarter  of  2005   and is expected to remain buoyant within the forecast  period, despite a temporary fo od export ban to Russia  and   Ukraine.   The   share   of   exports   to   non-EU    countries is likely to increase.  Growing imports in line  with  strengthening  domestic  demand  is  projected  to   lead  to  an  increase  in  the  trade  and  current  account   deficits  this  year  and  next.  However,  higher  transfers   from  the  EU  will  have  a  moderating  impact  on  both   the  current  and  capital  accounts.  After  narrowing  to  1.5%  in  2005,  the  current   account  deficit  is  expected   to widen to about 2% in 2006 and 2½% in 2007, and  will thus remain within sustainable bounds.   Labour market, costs and prices  Labour  market  conditions  have   been  improving  since   the  second  quarter  of   2004.  Overall,  employment   started to grow in 2004. It  increased by 2.3% in 2005  and  is  expected  to  stay  on  an  upw ard  trend  over  the   forecast horizon, but the employment rate remains the  lowest in the EU. As economic activity is accelerating  inter   alia    thanks   to   higher   investment,   projected    employment  growth  should  translate  into  a  lower   unemployment rate by more  than 2 percentage points  in  2006-2007.  The  pa rticipation  rate  is  expected  to   grow  slowly  up  to  64.2%  in  2007.  The  planned   reduction   of   taxes   on   labour   should   also   have   a    favourable impact on employment and unemployment  from  2007  onwards.  However,   unemployment  will   still be relatively high, above  16% of the labour force,  by the end of the forecast horizon, reflecting the deep- rooted structural problems in the labour market.   Unit  labour  costs  grew  by  2.1%  in  2005,  owing  to  a   drop  in  productivity  growth   combined  with  modest   compensation  growth.  In   2006  and  2007,  unit  labour   cost  growth  is  expected  to  expand  by  2¼%  in  2006   and 2½% in 2007 on the back of a moderate recovery  of      productivity      and      rapid      wage      growth.       Unemployment  is  reaching  levels  close  to  structural   unemployment, and thus  will exert to a lesser extent a  moderating influence on wage growth.  Despite unfavourable developments in oil and energy  prices,  lower  mark-ups  of  o il  refineries  and  subdued   food prices have kept HICP inflation relatively low, at  2.2% on average in 2005; year-on-year inflation went  down to 0.8% in December. In February 2006, annual  inflation reached 0.9% and is likely to remain close to  this  level  in  the  coming   months.  A  slightly  negative   output  gap,  which  is  not  likely  to  close  over  the   forecast  horizon,  and  muted  inflationary  expectations   are  projected  to  keep  inf lation  in  2006  and  2007   below the central bank’s medium-term target of 2.5%.  Inflation  is  forecast  to  reach  1.0%  in  2006  and  2.0%   in 2007.   Public finances   Since  the  2005  autumn  fore cast,  the  picture  of  public   finances   has   changed   significantly   as   a   result   of    substantial  data  revisions   following  methodological   changes. The 2005 general government deficit is now  estimated  at  2.5%  of  GDP  compared  to  an  earlier   prediction   of   3.6%.   This   significant   reduction   is    mainly  due  to  a  new  formula  transforming  cash  data   into  accrual  data,  an  upward  revision  of  GDP  by  the   statistical  office  and  lower  absorp tion  of  EU  funds,   which  resulted  in  lower  inve stment  expenditure.  In   addition,  the  record-high   corporate  profits  resulted  in   a  large  increase  of  corporate   income  tax   revenues  in   2005 which is not likely  to continue into 2006.  The  general  government  deficit  is  expected  to  reach   3%  of  GDP  in  2006,  above   the  target  set  in  the   January  2006  Co nvergence  Programme   (2.6%).  This   reflects       high       uncertainty       concerning       the        implementation   of   the    2006   budget.   Despite   the    projected acceleration of GDP growth, revenues from  indirect taxes are likely to be  lower than in the rather  very  optimistic  outlook  presen ted  in  the  budget.  In   addition,  there  is  a  risk   that  the  government  will   increase   social   expenditure   under   pressure   from    smaller  parties  or  if  the  prospects  of  early  elections   resurge.  Numerous  expend iture-increasing  initiatives   have  already  been  presented   in  the  so -called  political   “stabilisation  pact”,  which  was  signed  by  the  ruling   party and the smaller ones in February 2006.  Against   the   background   of   slightly   accelerating    growth,  the  general  government  deficit-to-GDP  ratio   is  expected  to  stabilise  at  3%   of  GDP  in  2007.  This   forecast  clearly  diverges  from  the  deficit  target  of   2.2%  of  GDP  set  in  the  January  2006  Convergence   Programme   mainly   because   it   considers   revenue- reducing   reforms   in   social   contributions,   personal    income  tax  and  value  added  tax  announced  on  31   March 2006. In particular, the  cuts in contributions to  the  disability  and  sickness  funds  (estimated  at  more   than  0.6%  of  GDP),  pro-family  tax  reliefs  and  the   indexation   of   brackets   of   personal   income   tax    (estimated  at  about  0.4%  of  GDP)  will  weigh  on  the   2007    budget.    The    revenue    losses    are    to    be     counterbalanced to some extent by increased revenues  from  higher  excise  duties  on  fuel  and  cigarettes  and   the removal of private con struction and renovation tax  reliefs (about 0.6%  of GDP altogether).  The  general  government  balance  presented  in  the   forecast  still  includes  the  surplus  of  the  second-pillar   pension  funds,  the  impact   of  which  is  expected  to   reach approximately 2% of GDP in 2006-07. The  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  projected  to  increase  by   more than 4 percentage points between 2005 and 2007  and it will reach 46.7% of GDP. A high growth of the  ratio  in  2006  (3  percentage   points)  can  to  a  large   extent    be    attributed    to     significant    stock-flow     adjustments  (around  2  perce ntage  points),  distributed   equally  across  net  accumula tion  of  financial  assets,   valuation effects and the difference between cash and  accrual balance. 		
April/2006	Portugal	Gradual recovery of activity, but imbalances remaining large 	In  2005,  the  Portuguese  economy  grew  by  0.3%,   indicating   the   continua tion   of   a   fragile   economic    situation.   The   growth   prof ile   was   uneven   with   a    temporary revival in the second quarter on the back of  a  carry-forward  of  purchases  against  the  increase  in   the  VAT  standard  rate  in  July.  For  the  year  as  a   whole, investment receded on the back of a shrinking  construction sector. Export s gradually recovered from  the   weak   performance   of   late   2004   and   imports    decelerated  markedly.  Altogether,  the  contribution  of   domestic  demand  to  GDP  growth   declined  over  the   year,  while  the  net  contribution  of  the  external  sector   gradually improved.  Nevertheless,  2005  was  marked  by  a  widening  of  the   external  deficit.  Notably,   the  primary  income  deficit   increased  and  current  and  capital  transfers  declined   considerably:  altogether  these  items  accounted  for   more than half of the  external balance deterioration.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Some  moderate  improvement  of  economic  activity  is   expected  this  year  and  next,  with  real  GDP  growth   rates expected to be close to 1%.  The contribution of  domestic demand to GDP growth  is  forecast  to  be  smaller  than  in  the  last  two  years.   Private consumption is expected to be constrained by  a   weakening   labour   market    and   high   household    indebtedness  against  the  backd rop  of  possibly  tighter   financing conditions. Add itionally, recent curbs on tax  credits   and   hikes   on   so me   taxes   will   constrain    disposable  income  gr owth  over  the  forecast  period.   Investment  is  expected  to   mirror  the  downturn  in   construction,  which  seems  to  be  the  result  of  cyclical   factors as well as of a more permanent downsizing of  the sector. At the same time , investment in equipment  will recover gradually over the forecast period, though  held back by the weak momentum of final demand.  The  contribution  of   net  exports  to  GDP  growth  is   forecast  to  be  slightly  positive  or  neutral.  Price  and   wage  deceleration,  in  particular  in  2007,  is  expected   to     create     some     leeway     for     export     growth.      Additionally, a contribution is  expected to come from  a   recovery   of   car   exports   already   in   2006   and,    building  upon  the  2005   experience,  exports  to  new   markets may become somewhat brisker. However, the  fact   that   some   export-o riented   industries   are   still    adjusting    to    supply    shocks    coming    from    the     increasing  integration  of   emerging  economies  into   world trade adds uncertainty to  the exports outlook.  The  external  balance  is  not  expected  to  improve  over   the  forecast  period.  In  addition  to  a  deterioration  of   the  terms  of  trade,  driven   by  oil  prices,  current  and   capital   transfers   are   predicted    to   remain   on   a    downward trend.   Labour market, costs and prices  In  the  past  few  years,  employment  has  been  affected   by the subdued economic  activity. Small employment  gains  are  projected  for  the  coming  years  in  line  with   the  expected  cyclical  recovery  of  activity,  yet  not   sufficient  to  reduce  the  un employment  rate.  Under   such  conditions,  wage   growth  is  expected  to  slow   down, putting a lid on  prices and unit labour costs.  In  2005,  inflation  fell  to   its  lowest  level  since  1997,   despite  the  pressure  exerted   by  higher  energy  prices   and the increase in the standard VAT rate from 19 to  21%  in  July.  However,  in   2006,  the  carry-over  of   these   shocks   will   weigh   on   prices.   Although   the    subdued cyclical cond itions, as revealed by a negative  output  gap,  are  pulling  in  the  opposite  direction,   average  HICP  inflation  may  nevertheless  increase  to   almost 2¾% in 2006 befo re declining in 2007.  Public finances  In 2005, the general government deficit corresponded  to 6% of GDP. The sharp det erioration from the 2004  deficit   was   largely   the   result   of   the   government    decision  of  no  longer  impl ementing  deficit-reducing   one-off operations. Tax revenue grew markedly in 2005, apparently as the  result  of  improved  tax  collection,  as  well  as  of  the   VAT  increase  in  July.  On  the  other  hand,  lower   dividend receipts from government-owned enterprises  acted as a drag on revenues. At the same time, current  expenditure increased further as a share of GDP, with  a  strong  increase  in  social  transfers  persisting  as  old- age  pension  schemes  mature.   Additional  expenditure   pressure  also  came  from  personnel,  health  and  local   government spending an d EU contributions.  Various  corrective  measures  on  both  the  revenue  and   expenditure  side  have  been  introduced  since  mid- 2005.   They   include   the   VAT   increase,   gradual    increases  in  some  excise  taxes  and  the  reduction  of   tax  credits.  The  main  corrective  measures  on  the   expenditure side concern health and pension schemes,  in    particular    those    for    government    employees.     Relevant changes have been also  introduced to central  government  hiring  rules  and,  in  2006,  a  temporary   freeze  of  staff  automatic  promotions  and  transfers  to   local government has been put in place 1 . Revenues  are  expected  to  grow  at  a  healthy  pace,  in   particular   in   2006,   under pinned   by   discretionary    measures  affecting  tax  rates  and  credits.  Whereas  a   slowdown in current primary  expenditure is expected,  sustained  control  will  continue  to  be  a  matter  of   concern.  In  particular,  social  transfers  other  than  in   kind  are  forecast  to  c ontinue  growing  well  above   nominal GDP. In addition,  interest expenditure seems  to have bottomed out  and to be starting to rise faster.  In  all,  the  projected  revenue  and  expenditure  patterns   will  yield  a  fall  of  the  general  government  deficit  to   some 5% of GDP in 2006. With high deficits and low  GDP growth, the government  debt ratio is projected to  continue increasing over the forecast period. 		
April/2006	Slovenia	Healthy growth continues 	Against   the   background   of   oil   price   hikes,   the    economy continued to grow steadily at 3.9% in 2005.  After relatively weak activity in  the first quarter, GDP  growth  soared  in  the  second  quarter  due  to  vigorous   car  exports  to  France  and   Austria,  but  stabilised  just   above 3.5% yoy in the second  half of the year. While  the export performance rem ained remarkably resilient  throughout   the   year,   impo rts   slowed   against   the    backdrop of high commodity price levels and subdued  investment  activity.  At  the   same  time,  major  de- stocking occurred, which dec reased annual growth of  real   GDP   by   1.7   percentage   points.   Domestic    consumption     was     stimulated      mainly     through      household  spending,  which   strengthened  following  a   sustained    rise    in    em ployment    and    favourable     borrowing conditions.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  In  2006,  real  GDP  is  projected   to  increase  by  4.3%,     largely  driven  by  domestic  demand.  The  external   contribution  is  expected   to  decline  but  stay  positive   thanks    to    the    favourable    circumstances    in    the     international  environmen t,  and  especially  owing  to   prospects   of   a   temporary   increase   in   Germany's    domestic consumption.   The  revival  in  foreign  markets  should  ensure  that   export performance holds up in the face of the fading  effect  of  the  recent  increase  in  exports  of  vehicles.   Imports  are  set  to  rise  in  step  with  buoyant  domestic   demand.  Household  consumpti on,   in   particular,   is    likely   to   remain   strong   in    the   run-up   to   euro    introduction.  Favourable  labour   market developments  and  attractive  credit  o pportunities  should  continue  to   encourage  private  spending,  especially  on  durable   goods.    Investment    spending     related    to    housing     construction is also forecast to stay high, as evidenced  by   strong   growth   in   the   number   of   construction    permits  issued.  Furthermore,  a  major  investment  in   the    highway    construction    has    been    announced.     Investment  expenditure  related   to  the  adjustment  of   production  processes  with  the  aim  of  improving  the   competitiveness     of     Sloven e     industry     is     also      anticipated to pick up.   In   2007,   GDP   growth   is   projected   to   decelerate    slightly  to  4.1%  since  foreign  demand  is  expected  to   slowly   lose   momentum.   Imports   are   forecast   to    increase  further  with  buoyant  private  and  investment   spending.  The  projections  foresee  the  trade  deficit  to   widen, however,  the current account  deficit is likely to  stay contained below 2% of GDP.   Labour market, costs and prices  In  2005,  against  the  background  of  a  remarkably   stable   exchange   rate,   infl ation   dropped   to   2.5%.    Throughout the year, market prices were driven down  by    increased    competition    resulting    from    EU     accession.   Furthermore,   the   government   regulated    administered price rises in such a way as not to exert  inflationary    pressures.    Excise    duties    on    energy     products   were   adjusted   to   partly   counteract   the    adverse effects of oil price hi kes. The lowest level of  taxes  allowed  by  EU  legislation  was  reached  in  July   2005. In the same period, the regular harmonisation of  excise  duties  on  tobacco  with  the  acquis  was  carried   out  as  requested  by  the  accession  agreement.  The   disinflationary path, how ever, remained smooth.  The  existing  government  pol icies  and  exchange  rate   stability   fostered   in   the    ERM   II   framework   curb    inflationary  pressures.   Assuming  contained  market   price rises following the limited second-round effects  of the rising oil price, inflation is expected to decrease  marginally  to  2.4%  by  th e  end  of  the  year.  The   mandatory  double  pricing,  in  effect  as  of  1  March   2006   throughout   the   economy,   should   limit   the    inflationary  impact  of  euro  introduction.  Consumer   price  growth  is  projected   to  stabilise,  though  this   forecast  remains  vulnerable  to  oil  price  shocks  and   liberalisation of the electricity and natural gas market  for households by 1 July  2007. Furthermore, there are  uncertainties  related  to  the  potential  increase  in  VAT   rates, which could add around 0.8 percentage points to the  rate  of  inflation,  and  the  outcome  of  the  pending   wage agreement.   The  labour  market  situation  is   set  to  improve  further   this  year  against  the  background  of  solid  economic   activity.  The  marked  rise  in  em ployment  recorded  in   2005   should   be   sustained    until   2007,   while   the    unemployment  rate  is  forecast  to  linger  just  above   6%. In 2005, an increase in gross wages compared to  2004  was  moderate  despite  the  effect  of  the  new  tax   regime,  which  ended  the   favourable  treatment  for   freelance  fees  and  thus  encouraged  employers  to  pay   salaries   instead.   The   negotiations   between   social    partners for 2006-2007 are  still ongoing and the wage  policy  is  expected  to  be  agreed  by  early  summer.   However, the government has declared itself in favour  of   maintaining   the   arra ngement   whereby   the   real    wage  rise  should  lag  behind  productivity  growth  by   more than one pe rcentage point.   Public finances  Following    the    third    consecu tive    alignment    of     government   accounts   to   ESA95   methodology   (on    capital   transfers),   the   general   government   figures    were  revised  upwards  by  0.1-0.4%  of  GDP  for  the   period  2000-2004.  In  2005,  the  deficit  declined  to   1.8%  of  GDP.  The  revenues  came  in  better  than   expected  while  the  increase  in  general  government   expenditure   was   contained   against   a   backdrop   of    restrictive   employmen t   and   wage   policies   in   the    public sector and rationalisation of government goods  and services purchases. The forecast for 2006 projects  the  deficit  to  worsen  against   the  decision  to  index   pensions  to  wages  and  the  commitment  of  the  new   government  to  gradually  ab olish  the  payroll  tax.  To   cover for the loss in revenue, an increase in VAT rates  is  contemplated  as  a  possible  corrective  measure.   Over  the  forecast  horizon,   the  general  government   debt is expected to stay just below 30 percent of GDP. 		
April/2006	Slovakia	Domestic demand remains the main growth engine 	Economic   growth   accelerated   to   6%   in   2005.   It    continued    to    be    driven    by    domestic    demand,     particularly  by  investment   and  private  consumption.   Robust   employment   and   real   wage   growth   lifted    private  consumption  growth  to  5¾%.  Gross  fixed   capital formation increased by 13¼%, boosted by the  realisation  of  some  big  investment  projects  in  the   corporate  sector  as  well  as  by  an  increase  in  public   infrastructure   investment.   The   contribution   of   net    exports  remained  negative  against  the  backdrop  of   lower real growth of both exports and imports.   The current account deficit widened further, to above  8% of GDP in 2005, as a sharply deteriorating income  balance added to the negative trade balance.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  The economic expansion is  expected to remain strong  at    around    6%    and    6½ %    in    2006    and    2007     respectively. Domestic demand is  likely to remain the  main  driving  force  while   export  growth  should  speed   up  in  2006  as  new  export  capacity  will  gradually   come  on  stream;  the  external  contribution  to  GDP   growth should thus become positive again.   An improving labour ma rket situation combined with  strong credit growth is expected  to continue to support  private  consumption  growth,  which  should  remain  at   above  4½%  over  the  forecast  period.  Gross  fixed   capital  formation  should  start  to  decelerate  markedly   in    2006    as    major    investment    projects    in    the     automotive  industry  are  to   be  finalised  in  the  course   of the year although the govern ment, supported by EU  funds,   continues   to   inves t   in   large   infrastructure    projects.  The  investment   boom  should  further  ease  in   2007,  under  the  assumption  of   no  new  major  foreign   direct   investments.   As   new   production   capacities    enter   full   production   only   gradually,   and   further    imports of investment goods for the new facilities can  still be expected in the  first half of 2006, the external  contribution  is  likely  to  improve  only  gradually  as   well. Accelerating  exports  and  a  lower  negative  income   balance  should  lead  to  a   significant  improv ement  in   the current account balance  in 2006 and 2007.    Labour market, costs and prices  Total employment increased by more than 2% in 2005  while  the  unemploymen t  rate  decreased  to  below   17%. Similar, though slower,  trends are anticipated in  2006 and 2007 as strong  domestic demand and newly  built  export  production   capacities  are  expected  to   create additional employment opportunities.    Although annual HICP inflation fell  to 2% in August  2005  and  averaged  some  2½%  over  the  first  eight   months,  adjustments  in  administered  prices  pushed  it   up  to  4%  towards  the  end  of  the  year.  Since  further   increases  in  administered  prices  and  indirect  taxes   followed at the beginning of 2006, the average annual  HICP  inflation  is  expected  to  reach  around  4½%  this   year.   As   these   one-off   effects   fade   out,   inflation    should fall back to abou t 2¾% in 2007 unless further  significant   increases   in   administered   prices   are    stipulated. Public finances  After tax reforms were put in place in 2004, a pension  reform   was   launched   in   2005,   affecting   social    contributions  by  redirecting  9  percent  of  gross  wages   to    a    funded    (second)    pens ion    pillar.    Due    to     widespread public  interest in this p illar, these revenue  transfers  are  estimated  at  about  ½%,  1¼%  and  again   1¼% of GDP in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively.   From  autumn  2005  until   the  end  of  the  transition   period   granted   by   Eurostat   in   spring   2007,   the    Commission  services’  forecasts  present  the  general   government  deficit  net  of  the  pension  reform  costs,   that   is,   with   the   second   pillar   pension   scheme    classified within government.  The  general  government  defi cit,  net  of  the  pension   reform costs, decreased to below 3% of GDP in 2005,  some ½ a percentage point lower than foreseen in the  2005  budget.  Furthermore,  the  2005  deficit  figure   includes debt cancellations amounting to about 1% of  GDP   which   were   not   incl uded   in   the   budget.    However,  for  the  seco nd  year  in  a  ro w,  this  positive   development   was   mainly   driven   by   the   fact   that    unspent  resources  of  around  ¾%  of  GDP  were  just   carried-over  into  the  next  year  and  thus  constitute   upside risks to the 2006  and 2007 f iscal outcome.   Furthermore,  January  2006  increases  in  excise  taxes   on     cigarettes     and     alcohol     induced     a     large      accumulation of stocks of cigarettes and alcohol at the  end of 2005 and thus resulted in better-than-expected  tax  revenues  for  the  year  (¼%  of  GDP).  This  effect   which  was  not  foreseen  in   the  2006  budget  will,   however,   negatively   affect   tax   revenues   in   2006.    Better-than-expected  GDP   and  employment  growth   combined   with   lower    interest   expenditure   should,    nevertheless, ensure that th e 2006 general government  deficit ends up at around 2¾% of GDP, slightly below  the  level  foreseen  in  the  2006  budget.  Increases  in   public expenditure in the election year are expected to  prevent a more significant fi scal consolidation despite  a favourable macroeconomic situation.   Under  the  customary  no-policy-change  assumption,   the  budget  deficit  net  of  the  pension  reform  costs  is   projected  to  fall  to  about  2%  of  GDP  in  2007  as  a   result of accelerating growth.  Gross  public  debt  is  estimate d  to  decrease  sharply  to   below 35% of GDP in 2005 as part of the privatisation  revenues from previous years has been used to pay-off  some  of  the  country’s  debts.  Government  debt  is   projected  to  slightly   increase  but  shou ld  remain  far   below   40%   of   GDP   over   the   forecast   period.    Moreover,     anticipated      significant     privatisation      revenues  in  2006  create  a  space  for  further  debt   reductions. 		
April/2006	Finland	Growth rebounding from temporary slowdown 	According  to  preliminary  national  accounts  data,  real   GDP  growth  slowed  to  2.1%  in  2005,  down  from   3.6%   in   the   previous   year.   The   slowdown   was    primarily    the    reflection     of    a    seven-week-long     production  stoppage  in  the  paper  industry  due  to  a   labour  dispute,  which  is  estimated  to  have  shaved  1   percentage  point  off  GDP  growth  in  the  year  as  a   whole.   Growth  was  driven  by  domestic  demand,  while  net   exports  contributed  negatively  as  a  result  of  the  low   activity level in the  paper industry. Persistently strong  household    consumption,    led    by    high    consumer     confidence,   increasing   credit   growth   and   rising    employment,   gave   the   main   boost   to   domestic    demand.  Following a 5% increase in 2 004, investment grew by  only  1.7%  in  2005  due  to  a  slump  in  machinery  and   equipment  investment  and  a  lower  rate  of  expansion   in residential construction. Import and export volumes  grew  surprisingly  strongly  in   2005.  However,  part  of   the foreign trade was accounted  for by transit exports,  such     as     automobiles     and     telecommunications      products,   which   were   imported   over   the   Finnish    customs   line   before   be ing   re-exported   mainly   to    Russia.   The   weakening   in    the   terms   of   trade    continued.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007   The economy is projected to return to and remain on a  firm   growth   path   throughout   the   forecast   period.    Survey  indicators  suggest  that  activity  will  pick  up   further  in  2006,  as  indust rial  production  and  exports   are  strengthening  while  domestic  demand  remains   solid.  Real  GDP  growth  should  rebound  to  close  to   3½%  in  2006,  partly  boosted  by  the  base  effect,   before  easing  somewhat  in  2007  towards  the  current   estimate of potential GDP growth of 3%.   After  healthy  gains  in  2005 ,  private  consumption  is   expected  to  continue  to  provide  the  main  stimulus  to   overall  GDP  growth  over  the  forecast  period,  albeit   decelerating  slightly  due  to  rising  interest  rates  and   moderating household borrowing. Public consumption  growth  is  foreseen  to  ease,  gi ven  the  efforts  of  the   central  government  to  control  expenditure.  Exports   are    anticipated    to    rebound    and    gain    further     momentum  as  import  demand  from  trading  partners   will  increase.  Imports  are  expected  to  grow  at  a  firm   pace on the back of lively domestic demand. Also, the  import content of exported go ods is on a rising trend.  Nevertheless,  net  exports  wi ll  give  a  strong  positive   contribution to growth in 2006  and to a smaller degree  in  2007  when  the  base  effect  from  the  paper  industry   stoppage has faded. Investment  is projected to recover  from the slump in 2005, led by equipment investment,  which   is   assumed   to   revive   as   stronger   business    confidence   and   order-books   have   improved   the    outlook for production and sales.   Labour market, costs and prices  Employment   increased   by   1.6%   in   2005   and   is    projected  to  continue  to  grow  at  a  similar  pace  in   2006,  before  slowing  somewhat  in  2007  due  to  a   slight  slowdown  in   economic  activity.  The  labour   shortages in some sectors are expected to be alleviated  by the lifting of the restrictions on the free movement  of  labour  from  the  new  EU  Member  States  as  of  1   May 2006, giving a boost to employment growth. The  unemployment  rate  is  proj ected  to  fall  steadily  well   below 8% of the labour force in 2007.   During the forecast period, HICP inflation is expected  to accelerate only slightly towards 1½% from 0.8% in  2005, the lowest in the euro area. Higher oil prices are  the most important factor exerting upward pressure on  inflation.    Tightening    co mpetition,    especially    in     services,  and  subdued  import  prices  of  consumption   goods  will  keep  consumer  prices  in  check  also  in  the   forecast period.  The  centralised  wage  agreemen t,  settled  in  late  2004,   provides    for    moderate    wage    increases    up    to    September  2007.  Assuming  the  usual  positive  wage   drift of about 1 percentage  point, per capita wages are  expected  to  increase  on  average  by  less  than  3%  in   2006-2007. Strong produc tivity growth appears likely  to limit the rise in unit  labour costs to about ½% over  the forecast period.   Public finances   The  outcome  for  the  general  government  financial   surplus  for  2005  and  projections  for  2006-2007  are   markedly   more   favourable   th an   in   the   previous    forecast   exercise.   Current   projections   indicate   a    general government surplus  of 2½% of GDP over the  forecast period rather than the 2% predicted in autumn  2005.  The  increase  is  due  to  a  better  outlook  for   revenues,   while   spending    is   assumed   to   remain    contained.   Based   on   the   Finnish   Government’s    medium-term spending guidelines of spring 2006, the  improvement  in  the  central  government  balance  will   shift the general government surplus upwards over the  forecast  period.  Local  government  finances  are  seen   to    remain    in    deficit    due    to    higher    operating     expenditure, even  with tax revenues  projected to rise.  Social   security   should   main tain   the   same   strong    surplus as predicted before.  The  government  debt  ratio  is  projected  to  steadily   decline  to  below  39%  of  GDP  by  the  end  of  the   forecast period. 		
April/2006	Sweden	Continued robust economic performance 	Swedish GDP growth in 2005 was 2.7%, representing  a slowdown compared with the 3.7% growth recorded  in   2004.   While   in   200 4   net   exports   contributed    strongly  to  growth,  in  2005  faster  domestic  demand   took over. Private consumption  advanced steadily and  also   public   consumption   growth   picked   up.   The    investment expansion was firm  with high growth rates  in equipment and constru ction. Net exports continued  to give a positive growth con tribution, albeit marginal  as compared to 2004,  as exports slowed down and the  pace of import growth stepped up.   Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Recent  indicators  are  generally  positive.  Consumer   confidence  continues  to   show  a  positive  picture  as   regards  household  views  both  on  the  economy  as  a   whole and on their  own economic situation. Industrial  confidence  is  high  in  ge neral,  as  it  is  for  services,   retail  trade  and,  in  partic ular,  construction.  These   indicators     should     support      continued     buoyant      performance  in  2006,  when   GDP  growth  is  expected   to  be  around  3½%.  Dome stic  demand  is  the  main   growth  driver  but  net  exports  will  also  contribute.  In   2007 the economy is expected to grow somewhat less,  closer to potential rates, while the negative output gap  is expected to close  and turn positive.  A  resumption  of  employment  growth  will  contribute   positively  to  household  disposable  income  in  2006   and 2007, enabling a pick-up in private consumption.  While  households  have  ta ken  on  more  debt,  wealth   has  benefited  from  rising  equ ity  and  strongly  rising   house  prices,  contributing  to   the  maintenance  of  a   relatively  strong  net  wealth   position.  The  saving  rate   remains   at   a   relatively   high   level.   Overall,   as   a    positive  risk,  private  consumption  could  surprise  on   the upside.  Growth in public consumption is expected to increase  in 2006, reflecting the improv ed financial situation at  local     government     level     and     the     relatively      expansionary   2006   central   government   budget.   In    2007,  public  consumption  growth  is  expected  to  be   somewhat    lower.    As    regards    investment,    the     conditions   for   a   c ontinued   expansion,   albeit   at   a    decelerating  pace,  remain  in  place:  a  benign  demand   outlook,  favourable  fin ancing  conditions  and  a  high   capacity   utilisation   rate   in   manufacturing.   Both    exports and imports are expec ted to pick up and grow  relatively   strongly   in   2006   and   then   slow   down    somewhat   in   2007,   in    line   with   world   markets.    Imports  should  also  grow  faster  as  final  demand   strengthens.  Overall,  net  exp orts  will  contribute  to   growth by close to a half-pe rcentage point of GDP in  both 2006 and 2007.   Labour market, costs and prices  The  labour  market  improved  in  2005:  employment   growth  turned  positive,  after  having  shown  negative   numbers  in  2003-2004,  and  the  unemployment  rate   stabilised  (it  should   be  noted  that  a  methodological   change    in    the    measurement    of    unemployment     increases  its  rate  by  around   0.5  percentage  points   from  2005  as  compared  to  2004  and  earlier).  The   relatively  strong  rise  in  economic  activity  over  the   forecast  period  results  in  a  continuing  improvement.   Employment    growth    is    expect ed    to    strengthen,     supported  by  a  significant  increase  in  the  volume  of   active  labour  market  measures  in  2 006.  Against  this   background,    and    the    unemployment    rate    will     decrease.   Weak developments in the labour market over the last  few  years  have  helped  to  contain  wage  demands.   Wage  demands  and  inflatio nary  pressures  remained   contained for most of 2005, allowing the Riksbank to  reduce  interest  rates  by   a  further  50  basis  points  in   June.  Inflation  thus  remained  low  in  spite  of  the   significant   recent   oil   price   increases,   but   more    recently  has  started  to  increase.  Given  the  somewhat   stronger inflation outlook, th e Riksbank raised interest  rates  by  a  cumulative  50   basis  points  in  January  and   March  2006,  effectively  neutralisin g  the  cut  in  June   2005. Wages are nevertheless expected to continue to rise relatively moderately, reflecting the current wage  agreement  for  private  sector  and  central  government   reached  in  the  spring  of  2004  and  covering  a  period   including 2006. Overall, inf lationary pressures remain  relatively  subdued  but  inflation  is  expected  to  rise   towards  2%  during  the  co urse  of  2007.  With  robust   growth  over  this  period,  and  with  a  stronger  labour   market, interest rates may rise further.  Public finances  In  2005,  the  budg et  surplus  was  a  fu ll  2.9%  of  GDP,   about   1.5   percentage   point   of   GDP   higher   than    projected  in  the  2005  autumn  forecast.  The  main   reason behind this rapid improvement has been a very  significant increase in tax revenues towards the end of  the  year.  It  should,  however,  be  noted  that  over  2004   and 2005 the budget has benefited from large one-off  (corporate)   tax   receipts   amounting   roughly   to   a    cumulative 1% of GDP.  Sweden  will  continue  to   show  budget  surpluses  over   the  forecast  period.  Income  tax  cuts  proposed  in  the   2006 Budget Bill, th e last step of a phased income tax  reform  (adopted  over  the  2000-2006  period),  as  well   as  additional  labour  market  measures,  will  contribute   to   an   expansionary   fiscal   policy   stance   that   will    reduce the 2006 surplus  as compared to 2005, though  the ratio is still expected to  be around 2% of GDP. On  current policies, and taking into account the additional  measures presented in the 20 06 Spring Budget Bill, a  slight  rise  in  the  surplus  is   projected  in  2007,  as  a   result also of an improvement  in the labour market. It  should  be  noted  that  Swedish  government  accounts   and the balances shown he re will include second pillar  pension   funds   (contributing   to   a   budget   balance    improvement  of  about  1%  of  GDP  per  year)  until   spring 2007.   General   government   gross   debt,   mainly   central    government liabilities, is proj ected to continue to fall,  to below 45% of GDP in 2007. 		
April/2006	United Kingdom	Moving to more balanced growth	From  3.1%  in  2004,  real  UK  GDP  growth  slowed  to   1.8%  in  2005  as  a  whole.    This  was  well  below   potential  growth,  reflecting  shrinking  manufacturing   output   and   slower   service   sector   output   growth.       However,  GDP  growth  of  0.6%  in  the  final  quarter   was the year's best outturn.  Faltering  domestic  demand  was  chiefly  responsible   for  the  sharp  slowdown  in  2005,  expanding  only   1.9%,   half   the   rate   of   growth   in   2004.   Private    consumption  growth,  in   particular,  was  much  slower   than  in  2004,  dampened  by  a  cooler  housing  market,   earlier  interest  rate  increases  and  an  erosion  of  real   disposable    incomes    by    higher    energy    prices.     Correspondingly, household sa ving rose to around 5%  of real disposable income from the very low levels of  2004.   Total   investment   also   slowed    compared   to   the    previous year, in spite of rapidly growing government  investment   broadly   in   line   with   budgetary   plans.    Business investment was h ighly volatile but, over the  whole  year,  did  not  seem  to   respond  to  favourable   conditions  (hig h  profitability,  robust  equity  markets   and  low  real  interest  rates).  However,  early  estimates   for investment tend to  be revised significantly.  Net trade data evolved erratically over 2005, although  these  are  thought  to  have  been  affected  by  intra- Community  VAT  fraud.  Overall,  data  show  slower   growth  of  imports  compared   to  exports,  consistent   with the observed slowdown  in domestic demand. For  2005  as  a  whole,  net  trade  had  a  broadly  neutral   impact   on   GDP   growth,   after   the   large   negative    contribution in 2004.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  Real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  increase  over  the   forecast  period,  to  around  2½%  in  2006  and  around   2¾%  in  2007,  mainly  th anks  to  expanding  domestic   demand supported by government consumption and to  a     lesser     extent     by     investment     and     private      consumption.  Household  consumption  should   start  to  pick  up  only   marginally  in  2006,  as  th e  slight  softening  of  the   labour    market    weakens    otherwise    steady    real     disposable   income    growth,   before   settling   at   a    moderate  but  significant  rate  of  growth  by  2007.   However,  private  consumption  growth  is  expected  to   remain  below  its  long-term  average  over  the  forecast   horizon,  reflecting  a  projected  increase  in  the  saving   rate  as  more  uncertainty  about  future  income  and   employment     prospects     l eads     to     balance-sheet      consolidation in the household sector.   Despite  favourable  cond itions  (high  profitability,  low   cost  of  capital  and  lack  of  spare  capacity),  business   investment is expected to remain subdued in 2006, as  favourable  conditions  are  offset  by  uncertainties  on   energy  prices  which  might   be  compounded,  for  some   companies,   by   relatively   high    levels   of   capital    gearing.  In  2007,  as  prospects  for  consumer  demand   brighten   and   spare   capacity   diminishes,   business    investment should ev entually pick up.   Growth in government consumption and investment is  expected  to  continue  to  play  an  important  role  in   supporting  domestic  demand,   growing  strongly  in  2006 but moderating in 2007,  in line with government  plans.   On the external side, net trade is expected to provide a  neutral  contribution  to  real  growth  over  the  forecast   period.    This  reflects  the  support  for  exports  from   faster  growth  expected  in  the  euro  area,  the  UK's   largest  market.  Nonetheless,  the  already  significant   external  current  account  deficit  is  expected  to  widen   further  as  UK  net  overseas  liabilities  continue  to   accumulate, reducing net income flows from abroad.   In  sum,  the  forecast  shows  the  economy  becoming   slightly  less  imbalanced  in  terms  of  demand  growth   with  net  exports  ceasing  to  drag,  while  government   expenditure  should  continue  to  be  the  most  buoyant   component of domestic demand in the short term.   Labour market, costs and prices  The  impact  of  higher  oil  and  gas  prices  on  headline   inflation  petered  out  more  quickly  than  previously   expected,  with  HICP  inflation 1   at  2.1%  for  2005  as  a   whole.   Going   forwards,   inflation   is   expected   to    remain  around  the  Bank  of   England's  target  of  2%,   supported  by  the  Bank's   ability  to   anchor  inflation   expectations. For the first three quarters of 2005, the labour market  remained   firm,   shr ugging   off   slower   real   GDP    growth.  Productivity growth thus slowed sharply and  unit    labour    costs    accelerated.    However,    labour     appears  to  have  been  hoarded,  with  this  beginning  to   unwind  in  the  final  quar ter  of  2005:  the  numbers  of   newly  unemployed  represented  the  fastest  quarterly   increase  for  over  a  decade.  Further  unwinding  is   likely  to  push  unemployment  up  to  about  5%  during   2006,  but  high er  real  growth  in  2007  should  help   bring  it  back  down  slightly.    Employment  growth   slowed  in  the  final  quarter  of  2005.    This  should   continue  into  2006,  in  response  to  slower  growth  of   the economy and already high employment rates.    Public finances   A preliminary estimate suggests that the deficit in the  2005/06  financial  year 2   stood  at  3.1%  of  GDP 3 .  The   1  Referred to in the UK as the CPI. 2   The  UK  financial  year  begins  in  April;  the  excessive  deficit   procedure applies to the United Kingdom on a financial year basis.  Actual  general  government  balance  data  reported  here  apply  the   Eurostat  decision  of  14  July  2000  on  the  allocation  of  UMTS   public   finances   are   estimated   to   show   marked    improvement in the first three months of 2006, the last  quarter  of  the  financial  year,  over  the  deficit  outturn   for 2005, thanks to buoyant  corporation tax revenues,  especially   from   oil-producing   companies   and   the    financial  sector,  as  well  as  relatively  strong  income   tax  receipts  and  social  security  contributions.  Part  of   the strong pick-up in receipt s in 2005/06 is temporary  in nature, due to the change in timing of payments of  corporation     tax     from     oil     companies     which,      compounded  by  rising  o il  prices,  had  an  important   role in boosting corporation tax receipts.  The table below shows the projections for the general  government deficit and debt  on a financial year basis. The  deficit  is  expected  to  improve  only  slightly  to   around 3% of GDP in 2006/07, and to narrow further  to around 2¾% of GDP in 2007/08.  The   improvement   in   th e   deficit   in   2006/07   is    supported  by  the  pick-up  in  economic  growth,  which   should   improve   the   tax   base   and   reduce   cyclical    expenditure.    Continu ing    profitability    from    the     financial  sector,  assuming  no  significant  reversal  of   the   currently   strong   equ ity   market,   suggests   that    corporation   tax   receipts   should   continue   to   grow    relatively  strongly  in  the  short  term.  However,  oil   production  is  now  expected  to   be  lower,  at  least  in   part  offsetting  the  positive  effect  of  rising  oil  prices   on tax receipts from oil-producing corporations.  These  on  balance  favourable  trends  are  partly  offset   by   a   projected   increase   of   discretionary   public    expenditure   as   a   share   of   GDP,   in   line   with    government  plans  (which  the  forecast  assumes  to  be   fully  met)  while  the  soften ing  of  the  labour  market   suggests that the strong growth in income tax receipts  observed  in  the  past  financi al  year  might  moderate   going forwards.    The  deficit  in  2007/08  is  e xpected  to  improve  to   below  the  3%-of-GDP  reference  va lue,  driven  by  the   strengthening   of   the   cyclical   recovery,   and   by   a    number   of   additional   factors:   first,   a   number   of    discretionary     measures     implemented     by     the      government  since  the  autumn  of  2005,  including  an   increase  in  taxation  on  oil  companies  and  further   measures   to   improve   tax   compliance;   second,   a    structural improvement in the ratio between direct tax  receipts  and  their  respective  tax  bases  in  line  with   long-term  trends;  third,   reflecting  the  government’s   plans,   a   projected   slight   moderation   in   overall    expenditure growth in the  2007/08 financial year.   General   government   gross   debt   is   projected   to    increase  from  around  42%  of   GDP  in  2005/06  to   around 43¾% in  2007/08.
